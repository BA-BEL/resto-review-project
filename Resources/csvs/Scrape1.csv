ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWFMQ0dnEAE,The taste of Taiwan nostalgia!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUxxbllnEAE,"Very disappointed. would give Zero if i can Soggy oily and tasteless, nothing compare to 7 years ago."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejZMcVhBEAE,"Never disappoints. Huge Asian chicken schnitzel. Super tasty, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCam9XWkV3EAE,"The chicken breast tastes juicy with crispy skin, never tried this before and that was a good experience. However I was surprised that there is only one staff in charge of everything, so the waiting time was quite unpleasant. Hopefully they'll optimize it in the future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCal9hcmdBRRAB,"I got a fried chicken here around 6. Unfortunately, the food is undercooked.after eating i felt stomachache terribly. I took unfinished chicken back to their store to deal with the drama, but it‚Äôs closed. I need an apology! Don‚Äôt go there except u wanna a diarrhea!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdzUzWDRBRRAB,"The quality is different, everyone fried, the taste is different Hope to strengthen staff training"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbmJQNVdREAE,"This time the chicken chop is thin enough, the bones are thicker than the meat"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MjR1TExREAE,"ORDERED: üçó‚Äã Hot Star Chicken with chicken salt, chili and seaweed ($10.50)  REVIEW: With insane amounts of customisation, Hot Star Chicken is so good, so oily but so bad for your health. You can choose to salt your chicken (up to a maximum of 3 items): pepper salt, chicken salt, cajun, chili, cheese, seaweed or no flavour. With the spicy level, you can choose less spicy, more spicy, less seasoning or more seasonings or even both sides for no extra cost.  As a base, Hot Star only season one size of your chicken which I found more than enough flavour. You also get little compressed bones at the bottom, but that's a refreshing change after working through the fried batter and the juicy tender chicken meat.  It's a great uni-fast food meal that gets you full. It's in a convenient location and even better with a gong cha to wash it down (usually the restaurant next door)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c0pLRnd3RRAB,"Refused to serve me due to ‚Äúbeing busy‚Äù. I was willing to wait and didn‚Äôt rush, bad attitude as well. Weren‚Äôt even close to closing and yelled at us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ME5LSndRRRAB,"The flour wrapped in the fried chicken cutlet is very fragrant, and the chicken cutlet itself is also very good, but the chicken bones underneath are not very convenient to eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjhxNnBRRRAB,"It's so unpalatable, the chicken chop is chicken breast, not marinated well, it smells like chicken, the shell is completely separated from the muscle, so disappointed"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOS1uRVpREAE,Very slow! Waited for 30 minutes for the order!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnBTdC1nRRAB,Good value good size
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaHU2Vzh3RRAB,I ate two by myself and it was delicious enough!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOHAtUThBRRAB,Chicken skin was undercooked. Chicken had bones. Overall terrible experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyME5qLURnEAE,the chicken pops and cajun fries were a religious experience. i literally couldn't focus for the next week because i kept thinking about the bloody chicken
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNUpiaU9BEAE,"Delicious üòã Unfortunately, the batter is too thick"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNC1EY0pBEAE,"Poor attitude and very unpalatable, no fried crispy plum noodles, just a little bit"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNW9qeW93RRAB,"I love hotstar large fried chicken, I usually order cheese and cajun flavor. But this time, I tried the chicken salt flavor just to try. It is too much salty.. too much. I know its chicken salt flavor but all I can taste in a bite is salt. this comment is for improvement purpose. I still love my chicken in cheese."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdHZHTmxBRRAB,"The worst fried chicken ever, meat is not fresh at all!!!  It stinks ü§Æ And the service attitude is very bad too..  Used to eat every time come down to city, but not going to buy anymore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLb0txLUt3EAE,"I ordered the Hotstar chicken and mushroom. Buy any 2 items and you can get a drink for $1 for the combo. Be prepared to wait as the food is cooked fresh to order.  The chicken was very flavourful and juicy especially with chicken salt seasoning. The mushroom was really crunchy too. The service was really friendly as it was my first time and I was confused and the female staff member helped me with the ordering process. The food also has to be eaten straight away or it will get soggy.  The wait during the lunch rush can be quite long as there is only 1 staff member juggling frying, ordering and seasoning , so if you want your food fast in under 5 minutes I wouldnt recommend coming here as there are a ton of fast food places nearby. Overall a good experience and I would return just for the chicken but maybe not for the other food items as it's quite expensive and you only get a small amount ...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbTVuUGZREAE,"Hot Star kept us full over covid and now! We love their chicken and fries. Easy service, great set up and its quick! Worth a try and make sure you take a pic... or it didn‚Äôt happen ü§™ #supportlocal anyway you can! See my insta and TikTok for more @splitthebill ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOXNDUF9nRRAB,The salt and pepper squids were excellent I also really liked the chicken until I found this HUGE annoying bone that make this snack not very easy to eat outside Unfortunately this bone was ridiculously oversized ... would be perfect without
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNUliRXpnRRAB,"Delicious, any other small fried food is also delicious üçÄ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MkpxbWtRRRAB,"Good food and service. My English is not good but there was a waiter that help me because he speaks Spanish too. Victor, from Spain. The only bad point I that the food was a little sensitive"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z0xmNUd3EAE,"We came here for lunch as a group and did not enjoy our time at all. The restaurant was practically empty, but we still were waiting outside the restaurant for 10 minutes for a table (despite having a booking). We ordered via the QR codes and all the food for the table came except one dish, and the staff were extremely unhelpful. Further, we were given a dish completely different to the missing burger, but the waiter informed us that the dish would be free for us as it would have been thrown out anyways. As a result, we split the extra dish and didn‚Äôt think much of it. After 45 minutes of waiting for one burger, we asked for someone to let us know when the food would be arriving as everyone else had already eaten. The manager was cold and unaccommodating, and went around the table asking everyone for their receipt and what they had eaten (even though almost everyone at the table had finished eating ).  He also specifically checked the receipt of the missing burger, but refused to acknowledge his team‚Äôs error and was indifferent toward our group. We thought this was very rude as, instead of accomodating for our group and acknowledging their error, the manager was demanding proof from us that we had watend exactly what we had ordered. After asking for a refund for the misplaced burger, the manager bluntly told us that it would take 5 days to come. The overpriced items on the menu do not reflect the poor quality of service. Over the course of our meal, the servers refused to make eye contact which would make us have to get up in the middle of our lunch and request extra sauce etc. Further, for a place that charges almost $30 for a burger, the toilets were shockingly dirty. Because of this, we won‚Äôt be coming back here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajRuamtBRRAB,Expensive food. Limited choice for vegetarians.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTgyV3NnRRAB,Terrible service and toilets were dirty. Food was not worth the amount of money we spent. Won‚Äôt be coming back again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanFUeFhnEAE,4 us went to dinner early enough to get the happy hour drinks. Good quality food. Ordered via QR
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXB1VUdnEAE,"Yesterday at lunchtime, my family and I had our first dining experience. We found the food to be delicious, but the service was a bit slow. Nevertheless, Eric, the manager , was very apologetic about it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXQ2bExREAE,"The food is a rather pricey considering its so simple - $36 for a basic burger, fries and a drink, the size seems pretty small. The service is good and staff are friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaW9qZXFBRRAB,"So dissapointing. The steak was all fat. Very expensive.  We couldn't eat the steak. When asked how the meal was I was honest and said it was fatty and inedible, the waiter said "" we will let our supplier know"" truly? When the ""chef"" cut that steak they would have known. Save your money. Yuk."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFB2TUt3EAE,"I didn't try the food, just a couple of towers we share. Good drinks, nothing exceptional, but the price was fair. Nice spot in Melbourne Central.  Negative: The glasses were old and the toilets dirty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGY2aFNREAE,"The service was exceptional. We were served by Setyawan, he was very friendly and anticipating my needs. While the food was really good! Highly recommend it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2RuMzFBRRAB,"A staff with spectacles ü§ì I guess his name is Diwas. He provided a great service to us.He was so cooperative and frank.We were so amazed by his work. He was taking orders , making drinks and serving them on tables by himself.üëèüèæ Hardworking ü´°"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnJDcXRBRRAB,The worst customer service ever üòµ‚Äçüí´ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnFQSmVBEAE,"Delicious food, friendly staff, great cocktails"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbEtMR1lBEAE,"TGIF's $10 cocktails during happy hour are unbeatable! The vibrant atmosphere and friendly service make it the perfect spot to unwind. You can't go wrong with their Long Island Iced Tea or Long Beach Iced Tea. With a wide variety of delicious, expertly-mixed cocktails to choose from, it's a fantastic deal that keeps me coming back for more. Highly recommend!  Their wings are pretty decent too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mkx5a3JRRRAB,"Staff were lovely, this chai has 0/10 caffeine in it tho"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE5DQUFnEAE,Great coffee and sandwiches! Lovely service. fun relaxed atmosphere
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d1BuZFRBEAE,"Good food and service - and next to a great library (SLV) that Melbourne/Victoria should be proud of. Dan, you need to adequately support the SLV"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTRtTHVnRRAB,"This is a great place to start your while waiting for the library to open and work there, you also have the option to sit outside. The staff is super friendly and will greet you with a smile, some of the people working there speak French and they are happy to talk to you in French. In general it is a very welcoming place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnUyNTh3RRAB,Great place for coffee
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGRXQ0h3EAE,Great cafe! Delicious coffee and extremely friendly service. Michael is amazing and so welcoming to all customers - highly recommended!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWJ6WXVnRRAB,"Coffee is good. Food is ok, a bit pricey for the portions. Paid $21 for the Dusty Recovery (store bought croissant, hash brown, smoked salmon and poached eggs hollandaise sauce, tiny side of avocado). Poached eggs were beautiful, for the portion of the meal though it's a bit on the pricey side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd1lYNlhnEAE,A beautiful venue next to one of my favourite places in Melbourne. The staff are lovely although at times a little hard to catch. Food is delicious and coffee is top notch.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXVfWWlBRRAB,"Pretty ok coffee and selection of snacks, sandwiches, banana bread etc.  Whilst Google says a 5pm closing time, at 4:53pm a waiter came over and rudely told me to leave because ""they'd closed at 4:45pm"". No problem if the published times were wrong, but think he needs to work on his tone talking to customers, even at the end of the day!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXFhSUx3EAE,it's laptop time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScV9fRl9nRRAB,"More than 15 mins to wait for a single takeaway coffee at 1.30pm. The place was not at all full. The food may be good, I can't comment, but I don't recommend it at all if you want to grab and go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDRMWlpBEAE,"Beautiful cafe with friendly service. Coffee is quite good, and you can visit the library easily. Unfortunately, the operation of the cafe seems very disorganized, with multiple staff members checking in on a single table, an order being taken multiple times, etc. Unsurprisingly, this lead to errors in my order each of the two times I visited. The fare itself is fine, provided you get what you ordered."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTlLeHB3RRAB,"I searched ‚Äúvegan‚Äù and found this place, always happy to support anywhere that has vegan options! In saying that - I would not recommend this place to someone who‚Äôs vegan.  I had a vegan sandwich and a coffee here. It was advertised as $12.50, the server said ‚Äúthat is meant to be $13, I need to change it‚Äù  and charged $13. It‚Äôs just 50c but felt like a poor move.  The sandwich was beetroot, pumpkin, avocado and spinach. The avocado had seen better days and the beetroot was a dip that was incredibly bland. I asked for some aeoli or tomato relish to make it a bit more appetising but it didn‚Äôt help. Im not a fussy eater but I didn‚Äôt end up finishing it. Pretty disappointing.  Coffee was decent. I paid for a large coffee to go but they ended up just giving me a regular. I was on a time crunch so I just took it and left.  Venue is nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobFo2b01REAE,Fairly priced cafe in cbd a breath of fresh air compared to overpriced establishments serving up overpriced garbage
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWU2SGxBRRAB,Order but wait for an hour then he said it‚Äôs not in the system. Worst customer service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmRQNktBEAE,Great juice!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGZ6Y1pnEAE,Atmosphere is nice with inside and outside seating. Coffee leaves a bit to be desired unfortunately. It's not likely to be a spot I'll come back to. The outside seating is a plus but the food and drink needs to see some improvement  for it to be more well regarded.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2VTRlp3EAE,Discovered this cafe by chance and it‚Äôs so worth it. Great breakfast menu with wholesome choices. Friendly service. Definitely recommended
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOW83dDZnRRAB,"Very nice place just besides the Library with special offers like Happy Hour, nice people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNXYtTW1RRRAB,"I worked here one day last year, they didn't pay me, I asked many times, but I still didn't get the money"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXY2Xy13RRAB,"Ordered a smoothie, so expensive and it turns out it was mostly crushed ice, could barely taste any fruit. Music was very loud."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob3NQRDJ3RRAB,"Slow service on coffees, need two barista's (inside) during busy times."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNE5UNHRRRRAB,"Great food and service, wife and I loved the cappuccinos, kids loved the smoothie and freshly squeezed juice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocDczdWJ3EAE,"The food was absolutely phenomenal, and the staff were truely so kind to us, couldn‚Äôt recommend more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4X05qVjNnRRAB,"Nice venue, tasty food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ak9lVjhnRRAB,good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDdDMWh3RRAB,"Great atmosphere staff are always friendly, highlighted by the pleasant ambience  within the dining quarters ....with ample space used elegantly  around the 1930""s  theme bar. Accompanied by delicious food and beverages complimented with adjoining balconies  overlooking a beautiful view of Melbourne's Architectural Treasures...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWJYbFVREAE,Good prices and Omar super friendly
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHF1LVd3EAE,Heaps to choose from the menu. It's a great place to go- after hour work drinks. Service was surprisingly fast considering we went there on Friday and the place seemed busy üëç
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHJqOGJnEAE,"Incredibly slow service. Understandably a Friday night but over 25 minutes for 3 Arancini balls and very nearly an hour after that for a veggie burger is pretty average.  Cool vibe, but if you can't feed people the vibe doesn't really matter"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEstQkNBEAE,Can honestly say nothing was too much. Service fantastic.meal delicious and cheeky banter too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaE5QdGpnRRAB,Brilliant bar right in the heart of the city.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUstRWZREAE,Order a camber bake horrible not melting the bread soaking in the oil 0 for the chefs The staffs really nice tho Hopefully the kitchen staff will improve very soon I couldn‚Äôt even eat ..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0tqYkpBEAE,"After getting positive reviews from friends to visit Father‚Äôs Office, the experience was hindered by the music offered by the DJ when it came to dancing. It was very inconsistent and hard to have a good time with. However, if you are looking solely for drinks after work, it is a pleasant venue."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTVQVXJ3RRAB,"I made a booking at this place for 8pm on a Sunday. Granted, it was a public holiday, but less than an hour before the manager texts me to say they are closing the kitchen early and last call will be at 9. I've worked a lot of hospo before but never worked anywhere that would have even considered closing early when there's a booking. After 4-5 texts back and forth (while I'm trying to enjoy a comedy show) and pointing out there aren't a lot of other places with availability, he begrudgingly agrees to hold the kitchen for us. Service wasn't much better when we got there. This place has seen better days."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1l5OEJ3EAE,"Highly recommended if you want drinks in the area, the happy hour is great prices and also got great food and bargains on different days worth a check"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGJ1bXZBRRAB,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. While they advertise specials and happy hour times very clearly, they fail to mention anywhere on the website and menu that their kitchen closes at 8pm. Extremely misleading and left us with a really rude shock when we booked a table for 7:30 and ordered starters and drinks, only to then be told ‚Äúkitchens closed‚Äù at 7:50pm. No heads up from the server when we clearly arrived for a meal, and we were bluntly dismissed by the server behind the bar when we asked why the menus had been removed from their app. Should have known better when we walked in and the place was close to empty. Never had an experience like this at any other establishment and hope to never again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGREY2RBEAE,Worst Espresso Martini ever!  From a tap with coco.  Made out it was a happy hour special.  Even had the hide to charge $12.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHZyNzNnRRAB,"Makes a simple impression, the coffee was very tasty, small freshly prepared snacks to take away from the deli counter, clean seating areas, friendly service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaG9tVmVnEAE,"The food is awesome and the ambiance is amazing but their customer service is especially amazing, specifically Omar, props to him, made me feel incredibly welcome and was incredibly attentive. I would 100% come back"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3JXZDNRRRAB,"Food is delicious. Manager is extremely friendly, I remember him from last time and I was impressed then. Thank you"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOXBpWENREAE,Absolutely splendid experience. Great venue with amazing views. Friendly staff. Yummy food. Cheap drinks. Happy hour. Suns out. People smiling. Loved my time at fathers office.  Make sure you grab an outdoor seat if the weather permits it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMjVtQnNnRRAB,"A smooth chilled out and easy to find bar, with a classy interior and nice views over Swanston Street. Great for after work drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX0l1V0pnEAE,"Pukar, Yash provided the best service I‚Äôve ever experienced. Friendly, accomodating and everything you could ask for. I would highly recommend anything having a 21st at this venue. Food + drinks were brilliant. 5/5."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bVBTSWhRRRAB,"Fantastic burgers with gluten free options,  very tasty and the service was top class and very quick"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3VTYVdnEAE,"Able to order food quite quickly. Our table waitress was not the most welcoming or courteous, but she could have been having a bad night..The food was lovely I do recommend üòÄ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDVYYWhnRRAB,So so food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ19PeHV3RRAB,My acquaintance and I came here for their Birthday dinner only to be met with crumbs on our table. Disgusting! The only crumbs worse than those on our table were the vagrants who occupy this serviette-less establishment. Food was decent.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNlpidEhBEAE,The burgers are alright. Somehow underwhelming (single burger on a huge plate).
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDllM0Z3EAE,Very nice staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmNPN05nEAE,The freshest food I've ever received from any Grill'd store before....good service too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGRLQlBnEAE,Healthy hot burgers of excellent quality and good maintenance of the place I recommend it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodklQaUxBEAE,"Pretty good burgers, friendly staff and competitive prices. Plant based burger was good but I especially liked the zucchini and sweet potato chips üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•. ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMktmTEVREAE,"The meat and bacon were not done, the burger probably was done quickly, finally just inedible"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoazliQkdnEAE,Very good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdjhfMEh3EAE,The GF burger bun was delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcWFYUk9nEAE,"Great spot, great service, but they got no bacon when I there. Devastating to the soul"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeDhTZFNBEAE,Burgers and chips are good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCczdmWjF3RRAB,Good burgers and decent salads! Can't really ask for more
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM2JxNUZREAE,"Pretty annoyed about my experience at this one. I always love Grilld and love how friendly the staff are but after a massive mess up of my order all I got was a rude and dismissive response.  I ordered on the app and selected pickup time on New Year‚Äôs Day. It was late but the restaurant was still open for an hour when I placed the order and I was able to order on the Grilld app.  I arrived at the restaurant at my designated time after hearing absolutely nothing for over half an hour I got a phone call just as I was walking in saying that they can‚Äôt make my order. I asked why I wasn‚Äôt told before as I just walked all the way and it‚Äôs late so things are now closing and the staff members response was ‚ÄòI‚Äôm calling you now aren‚Äôt I‚Äô  I couldn‚Äôt believe the response, no sorry or anything just straight back chat. I‚Äôve always loved that the Grilld staff have been really nice so this was quite a shock. She then said she could give me a refund, I was confused by how this was worded because she had to give me a refund. She then tried to refund me less money than what I had paid and not included the holiday surcharge.  I‚Äôve never said this about anyone before but I honestly think that staff member should be sacked because that is not the kind of attitude you want to be representing your company. I have also never left any review less than 5* before but I‚Äôm really annoyed about how I was treated here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa2ZycHFBRRAB,Plenty of seating and great staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeXBHUG1nRRAB,Beautiful burger
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCck5yV3BRRRAB,"Bit overpriced but the girl with the fringe that served me today was extremely polite, she went above and beyond for me. Staff were amazing and the food was tasty!!! Did take a while to get food though‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbE8tUlRnEAE,I tried the Wagyu BBQ burger and it was very tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaFBlbFRREAE,Service was good. Atmosphere was good but beef patties where dry in our experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dE1EQUdREAE,"Food was okay, the chicken dumpling was not good. Service was ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aVBXdURnEAE,"Waited for chicken rice takeaway for 20 mins and they said they missed my order. After I asked, it was ready in 2 mins."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeElHalNBEAE,"Paparich is our favourite from Malaysia, they have best coffee, roti Chennai and ayam curry. From breakfast to dinner they have many tasty option. Located in mall so convenient to access but the place closes early so check your timing as this is not something open late night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVlLcjhBRRAB,They microwaved my food after they served it cold. Never coming back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVphLTFnRRAB,"Good location.  Very nice tasting meals, with a  good choice of different types of food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVpERFBBEAE,Delicious and absolutely love our meal at paparich! Clean and bright interior and service is polite.  Recently student edge has a deal with paparich such that a meal + drink is only $15.90. You will need to download the student edge app to redeem plus bring your student card. Only for 3 selected dishes and 2 types of drink.  Take note of surcharge on Sundays and public holidays.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbm9MTjdRRRAB,Have been to this restaurant few times and still love their food. My favorite aretheir prawn noodle soup and chicken satay.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMXAyQV9nRRAB,"Horrible malaysian food ever had,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXFLQkJBEAE,"Visited PappaRich in a party of four. Good selection of foods with vegetarian options available. Staff brought out one dish very quickly but then the rest took quite a while and we‚Äôre all very staggered, with the last meal coming well after the first meal had been consumed and then the dumplings came after the main meals had been served. We also were given another table‚Äôs food and not our last meal so everything was a bit all over the place but flavours were nice and food was all enjoyed. Just could have been a better serving experience. Surcharge on a Sunday is also crazy to me. If you can‚Äôt afford to be open normally on a Sunday maybe don‚Äôt be open. Don‚Äôt make customer pay for more if you‚Äôre only going to give average service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXJIU25BRRAB,Very dry hard Roti today‚Ä¶.normally soft & fluffy. I really hope Your not using frozen? A little disappointing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3BiY19BRRAB,"Good food and fast service. Waitstaff were fast. However we order OJ, the quantity was half of the glass was bubbles only. Not a reasonable price to be paid."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdE5PR2lnRRAB,"I wanted to order the Wokkein noodles with the exception that I did not want a particular ingredient included in my dish. The staff did not comply and came up with excuses saying that they were new staff and could make such changes. I wasn‚Äôt really asking for much and found it very disappointing that they couldn't do a simple change to my meal. In the end, had to eat a dish that was not very satisfying. Never going there again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEota3hRRRAB,Paparich in QV deliveries great Laksa and Char Kway Teow. The menu has been revamped with more additions. Great service here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc0k3TmJREAE,Got food poisoning here on Thursday. Still recovering today.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTZISWRBEAE,"The interiors remind me of the cheapest eateries in south east Asia. The food came out almost immediately which can‚Äôt be a good sign and wasn‚Äôt-dry chicken skin, overcooked chicken, tasteless dishes‚Ä¶Regretful visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3ZtYVhREAE,"They‚Äôre noodles are too salty and the flavor was basically just soy sauce , not to mentioned they charge 19.5"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX0xTY0dBEAE,"Decent laksa, but with no veggies (like eggplant and greens) other than tomato, so it was slightly disappointing. :("
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoXzhfb3ZnRRAB,"Wanted to try their food, arrived at 08.28pm on a Wednesday. Had to go back since they said they were closed for new orders however google says they are open until 9pm. You should update your timing if there is any change rather than misguiding people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLWRmZ2dnRRAB,PappaRich offered casual Malaysian/Indian-influenced meals at reasonable prices. The food quality had been relatively consistent over the years and so was the efficient quick service. My favourite was the hainanese chicken rice paired with congee.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXJmUXpBRRAB,Charging $1 for a take away container on a $65 order. Times must be tough
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNUt1LW5BRRAB,"Very disappointed with the service. We were 4 and 3 of our meal came in. The 4th mean wasn't there until we 3 finish ours. Call the waiter and she check and said 1 min. Another 15 min pass and nothing then call another waiter, explain the same thing but again nothing. Later call another and the guy with black dress came out - thing he is a manager and he said it will be there and again nothing. So we have to ask the same thing 5 times and have to take away the food. There was no cutlery and so asked to put that in and gosh another wait for just o add cutlery in order. Asked if we have to pay and the waiter ask guy in black desk and he wasn't interested to even give discount. Won't be going back again to this PappaRich."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNk9DdzFBRRAB,PappaRich is a good restaurant chain. The QV store has a big seating capacity. The kitchen and bar are huge too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWZPYkRnEAE,Fake
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocU5XNnJBRRAB,"Wait until we finish ordering, they said that we couldn't bring outside drink, the chicken rice was not delicious, and I went home and vomited."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeUxHTFl3EAE,Ordered the roti telur which came with 3 dipping sauces. So tasty brought me back to Singapore hawker centres. Had iced tea with 3 milk combination. Price affordable though service a little slow.  Staff not chatty as busy. Definately. be back to try other dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcjU3Yk1BEAE,In QV so naturally still good location. Food wise abv average.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mkk2QXBBRRAB,I had a chicken curry as I got a voucher from an event 'shop the city' the other day. It was delicious and good spicy level. I am Japanese and found this curry is a same taste when I had a Japanese curry in Japan too.  I was surprised there was a long queue when I came. This place must be popular. Foods' prices are reasonable. Friendly staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFpyVERREAE,Karaage curry was very tasty. $17 for a large was pretty good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbHRxQ2Z3EAE,My favorite comfort food since 2011 my uni days till now when I‚Äôm on Holiday üòä The most favorite dish : 1. Kay‚Äôs Chicken (4.5/5) 2. Chicken / Pork Japanese Curry with Rice (4/5)  Strategic located in the center of QV The price was unbeatable cheap perfect for studentsüòç Taste always consistent and never disappointed Will always come back when I visit Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMkxYUnlnRRAB,Nice little casual place I like to visit with my friends for a quick but to eat. Menu is relatively affordable with a decent range of options
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUt6aDh3RRAB,Still my favourite place to get japanese curry and Kay's chicken since uni time like 15 years ago
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaFpIVVdREAE,"Delicious food, fast service, good staff üëè"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVk3SldBEAE,The tofu curry was ok but needed more curry for the amount of rice provided.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUxiaUF3EAE,Tasty. Quick. Affordable. Healthy. Convenient. Would give this place ten stars if possible!  Have been eating here for more than five years now and the taste is still the same! Delicious! And I hope this never changes!  There is just something about this place that reminds me of home. I wish to some day eat at this place with my kids and tell them I have been coming here for a very very long time!  Never change! We love you for what you are now and forever will. Thank you Hanaichi!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScU5hUExnEAE,Liked it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNElPenRBRRAB,Decent katsu curry with reasonable price.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWMtR1RnEAE,Beautiful food and atmosphere.  Lovely setting too. The staff are lovely and friendly also. I recommend this restaurant to eat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3Z5Q3NRRRAB,Good food with good prices. It's convenient that everything's already takeaway.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXIzUkl3EAE,From my experience one of the best value lunches in cbd.  I had Kay's chicken and loved it.  Good quality chicken pieces unlike many competitors.  Plentiful seating.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXFfV09nEAE,Good value of good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaDVhRlFREAE,"One of my favourite places to grab Japanese food, the Kay's chicken is brilliant"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNOVktNVp3EAE,"I come to this place to remind myself of my uni days, except now I have money and the same amount of depression. 10/10 would karage again. Still great in 2023."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoanN5c0dBEAE,I ordered a set of cutlet curry and rice bowl. was delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemNfTXlRRRAB,"Schnitz used to be great.  Utter garbage now, clearly franchised out with no care at all.  Cold food, filthy store but hey it's QV, you know you get the foot traffic so you don't care about quality.  It's funny how the good reviews have replies from management and the poor ones are ignored."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMm9IbnFnRRAB,Waited half an hour for food in an uncrowded restaurant. One meal was lukewarm when it arrived and one meal that was piping hot but had chicken that looked like it had been cooked by a flamethrower - charcoal black. No apology for the wait and very disappointing overall experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3IzN0J3EAE,Group of 6 all ordered individually but sat at the same table. 5 meals delivered but the 6th meal (which was ordered first) had to be chased up with 2 requests to staff and finally was delivered after everyone else at the table had finished eating.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTh5ekpBEAE,"Today I got the plain and simple wrap and it was delicious. The girl who served me was absolutely lovely, and my dog also loved her. We are very happy with the kindness and amazing service given today.  Made the slight wait for food well worth it. Thank you guys!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHVxUThBRRAB,Salad was old and mouldy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHRxM09nEAE,Love how they are open till 9pm but dine in closes at 8:30 despite it not saying that on their website nor have we had this happen before when dining in. Woman wasn't polite about it either
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXVYa3dBRRAB,I‚Äôve been eating schnitz fairly regularly and today there was a win in the seriously overflowing bag of chips but a loss in the chicken schnitzel that tasted kind of hard in places and possibly not cooked properly (which I cut off just to be safe). Still a big fan so I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs put me off ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjlHcFJREAE,"Poor quality service and food. Had to wait 40 minutes for food. Average taste and very oily. The serving time management is surprisingly shocking. It was 5 of us went there for late lunch around 3:15, the restaurant was not busy. We all ordered 1xchicken schnitzel and 3xchiken parmi and 1x Caesar salad. . They brought the first dish (chicken schnitzel) and the waiter disappeared when I asked were is the rest of the food, she said it will take time. In what restaurant on an earth you get the food with that much gap and served separately. I mentioned the first dish is already getting cold as we were waiting for the rest. The waitress took the dish back in. The salad was pretty average as well. The schnitzel in it was burnt and dry. With Just tiny smashed avocado aside. We would have left the restaurant if we could. Feeling sick after that as the food was bad quality and oily. I don‚Äôt recommend it at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzdLSEVBEAE,"I ordered Garden of Eden Burger just coz I love Beetroot and the other veggies in it. However, this time I got it without the beetroot and when asked the person said we have run out of it. My question is why as consumer we are not told while placing the order? Please let ur diners know that you are out of something."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobWU3R2J3EAE,Use to be quick service here but lately the wait is very long. Maybe because you have so many Uber eats orders at lunchtime and have to get them ready. Meanwhile long line of customers waiting and customers waiting for food for over half hour I think it‚Äôs wrong that the person taking orders has to also serve the food that‚Äôs ready. Get more staff if you‚Äôre so busy? Also noticed it‚Äôs so hot in the store! So many aircon units and none are on Very bad in summer . It‚Äôs cooler outside on a 30 degree day than inside. Get your air con fixed or turn it on!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc1ktbUNBEAE,Decent enough
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod09TdnZ3RRAB,The food is delicious. Environment is clean and tidy. All the staff tonight went out of their way to find me a power adapter so I could charge my device. Very kind individuals.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMFkyb0FREAE,"Terrible service, tall white guy with black hair and likes to wear jewellery has an attitude and gives bad service. Everytime i go there, i have to wait for 30mins for a burger and some chips even though there‚Äôs barely any customers in the restaurant. They didn‚Äôt call out my order when it was ready and when i finally asked for it, thats when they brought it out. food was already cold, i don‚Äôt know how their store is surviving with this low level of service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdWFIYmtRRRAB,Ordered through the schnitz app for takeaway and waited 35 minutes for 3 wraps and 1 family chips with 3 cooks in the kitchen and only 4 or 5 tables occupied. Once we took it back to the hotel on a 30c degree day it was not even warm enough. Possibly the worst schnitz branch there. Avoid this place at all cost!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX3JDUDJBRRAB,"got served absolute vomit, this place is horrendous"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdnV5czdnRRAB,"The sauce that you have eat with the chips costs $1.2 and tge amount is very tiny It's very over priced, and it's supposed to be provided with the food for free"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdnBqR1ZREAE,"Absolute disgrace, food was served cold and although it took 40 minutes for something I could make at home in 20, the meal looked rushed out of the kitchen and they forgot to add some toppings and salted the fries when asked not too...  Appalling service of a business that obviously doesn't care, if I was a teenager I wouldn't work here just out of respect to myself. Replying to negative review's seems to be the only thing they are good at."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMS1uV2VREAE,The service is ridiculously slow. Even if you order 20-30min in advance your food still won't be ready upon your arrival.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM2RIV0d3EAE,"Definitely not coming back here. This place does not represent the brand. Food wasn‚Äôt good at all, weird chicken (didn‚Äôt seem fully cooked). The waiter was dragging himself around and talking in a very lazy way. Asked to turn the heater on - was ignored."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdVpqQ3d3RRAB,Got sweet potatoes here and all the chips were burnt and disgusting And the staff trying to give ridiculous excuses And they didn't offer the refund for it Until I asked They agreed that the chips look burnt and crushed was looking terrible And the place looks dirty I'd blame the manager for the lack of managing and having unprofessional staffs working here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMmFMVUl3EAE,The schnitzel was great - tender and good balance of taste for my 'loaded' despite the fact that they were rushing. We came in a big group of about 30 so you can imagine the rush. They didn't handle the numbers (pre-ordered) as well as they could have compared to the other establishments we went to (likely short-handed in these post-pandemic times) but kudos to the team for maintaining standards and the manager for remaining calm and polite even to a less than polite customer.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtalBta0pREAE,I love schnitz but wont consider this place for dine in. Poor service. We waited for 30 minutes after placing the order and finally after reminding that we are waiting food was served and it was cold.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbS1HZVZBEAE,Closes too early and only does chips well before closing time - arriving after 7:30 pm is probably a waste of your time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdWFlUm5nRRAB,"Usually a fan of the franchise but this one drops the ball HARD. Arrogant staff, dirty tables, incompetent ordering system. Go support the other store in the city, they won‚Äôt blame you for their system not working."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtc0puUnhnRRAB,"Been to Schnitz QV more than this one time. Hit or miss Schnitz Location.  Taste: 3.5/5 üòóüçΩ Service: 3/5 üë®‚Äçüç≥ Looks: N/A (Takeaway) üåØüçü Atmosphere: 4/5 ü™Ñ  Restaurant is relatively clean, with tables spaced well enough apart and tidied up fast. Filled with warm inviting lighting among dining customers.  Have previously waited 25 minutes for lukewarm family chips (9.90) in empty restaurant, gave them the benefit of the doubt for the service.  Ordered a teeny-weeny pack (9.50 + 1.00 sauce). Was given an estimate of a 20 minute wait for dine in.  Food was served in a takeaway bag instead of a plate for dining in. Not the biggest deal, but was given a used tissue, which was funny and strange.  Unhygienic, but otherwise one of the better experiences at Schnitz QV given that chips shouldn't take that long, and this order showed that.  Give it a shot if you want to. Chips are great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUxURGV3EAE,"By far the worst sushi hub in the city, both for service and quality"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSby1IcHp3RRAB,Yummy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocC1IaVpnEAE,"opens early, alright sushi"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaG9pTU5nEAE,"Good taste, fast service, nice staffs! I love them!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbjZyUHV3RRAB,"I was pleasantly surprised how fresh and value for money the nigiri was. I had some of the torched scallop, torched salmon and the crab leg nigiri and it was delicious and filling. Will definitely come back and try some more next time. Would be great if they had some seating for a quick eat-in."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeFktSzJ3RRAB,Every time if I need a good and healthy food.  Sushi hub it's the answer.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbDVLU2NREAE,Just ask if anyone has diarrhea after eating on January 5th
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeXVhWUd3EAE,Pretty decent sushi that is easily accessible in Melbourne and Sydney. Love their selection and the convenience of purchasing it. You can freely help yourself to the soy sauce and wasabi. It‚Äôs quite reasonably priced as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbjhpR1Z3EAE,I bought the salmon sashimi but the staff didn‚Äôt give me soy sauce and wasabi.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOTVtMUtREAE,I bought Sushi from this place today about lunch time around 12 pm. The staff is very rude and provided bad services ....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZ29uNlN3EAE,Nice sushi
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX09PLV9BRRAB,"When you pay sometimes you obviously have to take some seconds to put your card or money in the wallet. This woman today was super rude hurrying me with her hand indicating me to move and take the sushi quick. I had two bags and was struggling to take the money and everything. Only other woman was behind me in the line, is not necessary to be so disrespectful. Be more kind with the client or better don‚Äôt work"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ1B5OWxRRRAB,"Very disappointed with the customer service there. I am a mom with two very cranky toddlers, we bought lots of sushi  from them. My son just dropped half of the sushi on the floor, very cranky and I just wanted to buy and picked one sushi with a bit of longer tail. But supervisor Shirley doesn't have empathy. She is very stern, inflexible and keep saying no and she choose the lowest one with tail. I know she is young but you should have empathy with your customers. I didn't ask for much. We bought a lot of sushi from them and we just wanted to pick only one to replace the one that my son dropped. Very disappointed with the customer service here. We went to other Sushi Hub but never have issues."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM2YyMXRBRRAB,"I used to buy Sushi from this place a lot, now it‚Äôs getting too pricey for the sushi ect. Customer service is amazing, Sushi is very tasty, price is no good please bring back the old price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdFl2X1NREAE,"When you cook chicken for your sushi rolls, please cook it properly so that your customers avoid severe food poisoning caused by salmonella. Parts of my chicken were raw."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybjVmdmR3EAE,Excellent!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNHR6NkJ3EAE,Crab meat never disappoints me!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd3ZQUmpBRRAB,Rice super sticky
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNk1YUnF3RRAB,Sushi quality is great especially their tempura prawn and katsu. Great for a quick snack or lunch during breaks and staff there are friendly and quick.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbjVfOV9nRRAB,Very good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVMTctV2tnRRAB,"Bit pricey but very good quality, sushi rolls actually have *filling* at the bottom/hidden side. You see, most sushi places think you're mentally challenged and incapable of noticing they ripped you off by not inserting 20% worth of the filling at the bottom."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHanR1ZkVBEAE,"We took pre-prepped container sushi and queued in line, but they kept serving those who chose the inari and handrolls first. What‚Äôs the point of us queuing then and how were we supposed to pay?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOThYYjdRRRAB,"great sushi, wont say the best, but its always reliable and consistent, great when you need a snack or a lunch break / on the go. if you want a custom order even, they will make it for you. now thats 5 star service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dklXMFFREAE,My go to hot pot spot in the city. Freshest ingredients with a massive sauce selection prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity. Absolutely love this place and highly recommend

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dU9ISU9BEAE,DO NOT EAT THE FRIED CHICKEN!! the fried chicken we got was raw and blood red inside. bbq meat was good value for money but i wouldn't suggest getting anything else
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MlAzekNBEAE,Unfortunately I believe the chicken we ate when when we came here was raw and made a few of us sick. Everything else was fine just please be careful when eating the chicken
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDlHcmd3RRAB,Great food highly recommended
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTV1TV9RRRAB,"A bit of a wait for a table, but you can't blame them for that as we had not booked. Once we were seated and the BBQ was fired up we got started on piling up spicy Beef, ox tongue, chicken and seafood to our heart's content - I think we got through 9 plates with soup and rice as well üëåüòã All for $85 including a Korean beer"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjUyRkZREAE,Value for money for entire family or big group. Good quality food for the price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXVDQWhnRRAB,"There are abuntant type of beef and other meat, however the quality is not satisfied. No supplement when the meat were consumed. Ventilation of the restaurant is terriable, the air is full of smoke."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeW9Eell3EAE,Excellent value for $39pp all you can eat. No complaints
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaEozNDNRRRAB,"Friend found this BBQ buffet which I have never try before. They are pretty busy so make sure you make a reservation. One we got in, they are pretty smokey in the room, meat and veggie seem fresh, they also serving some korean fried rice, rice cake, kimchi and steam rice. And you have two hours limitation. But that‚Äôs enough for us anyway."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE9pSFhBEAE,Good variety of meat but could do with more vegetables but for the price is fine. Very friendly and helpful staff! Overall a good experience for me and family.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodC1YeWVREAE,"Good value but like das it lol. the area kinda stank, cus they don't have proper ventilation to get rid of the smoke from the BBQ so I felt kinda greasy and my eyes kinda stung üòµ‚Äçüí´"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeUw2NnRBRRAB,Value for money and worth a try üòÅüòÅ
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2VLWktnEAE,"Value for money, great selections. Remember to book ahead of time. Come early. The queue is crazy! But once everyone gets cooking it settles down. And come hungry!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ2V6VUx3EAE,One star is too many. Bad service! Don't go if you want have a good night and dinner
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3NIbGZREAE,Very very cheap and same level of food quality Valuable for kbbq buffet Not much choice of meat and side dish Better go early as it get smoky very soon Or better sit closer to entrance
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUxYV1JREAE,The food is fabulous and the DJ spins great tunes without it interfering with the atmosphere.  Highly recommended!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVlYWm13RRAB,"A great selection of Amaros, very friendly staff. We had pizzas and they were amazing"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2JpNU9BEAE,Good pizza + good vibe = good life
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenN2QURREAE,"There was a massive line up at 5pm for opening, they seated everyone and the service was fantastic. The pizza was light and fresh!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM09lVkxREAE,Great service and the pizza was so nice. Really enjoyed our meal and the music and friendly staff ensured a good night out
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEozM1lnEAE,"Great vibe, good drinks. Tasty pizza. Hot chefs.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTlpcTlRRRAB,Love this place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzkzMFNREAE,Fantastic pizza
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzdUOFFBEAE,"As an Italian citizen living in Melb, I reckon this is number one Napoli style pizza in Melbourne. Forget DOC and Gradi. This place pizza has been adapted a bit for Melbournian taste so some pizza type are a bit off when it come to ingredients combinations but, if you find something that fits what you want, I can guarantee it will be tasty and well cooked."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXJ5cUZ3EAE,Possibly the best margarita pizza I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Couldn‚Äôt fault it. Friendly staff & great vibe.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeE9HYUNnEAE,Just loved there pizzas. So nice and really well cooked. Also their Gnocchi is delicious. Will be visiting again. Also customer service is great too.  Must try pizzas from SPQR.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbUp2OW5nRRAB,"Absolutely incredible pizza, vibes, music, as well as the service. Everyone is extremely attentive and as a repeat customer I‚Äôve always had a great time. I won‚Äôt go anywhere else in Melbourne for pizza üçï favourites are the funghi, otherwise any special is always a go!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbVBuQnR3RRAB,Awful service. Rude people
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWIzMWhBRRAB,"Lets talk about the Caprese Salad, I'm crazy for them and if it's on the menu I'm going to order it, sadly I'm usually disappointed but not so at SPQR, there's is perfect, vinaigrette on the side, plenty of basil and really tasty barrata! The pizza's are great, they are generous with the toppings. It's a cool inner city pizza joint."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3M2a2NBEAE,"My favourite pizza place in the area, great for thin crust pizza with good and quick service. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options, not just margherita, plus gluten free bases available. Gnocchi and Tiramisu are great too! Always a fun vibe but if you don't like noisy restaurants the evening time here is not for you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXFEYjlBRRAB,Bit disappointing - had the pepperoni and it was really soggy in the middle and looked like it was thrown together. Not a great deal of cheese - really a non event. Read good reviews but wouldn‚Äôt return. Expensive for what I got - $45 for one pizza and a beer.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXFqWmxBRRAB,Great pizza...absolutely on the spot..fresh ingredients...top class services..great place for a quick bite..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3VHR0lREAE,Good pizza. A bit expensive but top quality
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHNpWjR3RRAB,Amazing pizzas ...best base I've had ever.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoakxLd3FnRRAB,Over priced over hyped under performs. Better go to Dominos.....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeUphaHVBRRAB,"Went on Monday and got a Margarita pizza and Beer. It was margarita Mondays (pizza and beer $25) so that was great value for money relative to Australia/Melbourne. Pizza was great and as close to Italy as you‚Äôll fine. Service was good and very fast too. A great spot. 1 star knocked off for lack of beer/cider choices on tap and a few minor changes I‚Äôd recommend for the pizza. Overall, fully recommend going and trying it out !!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodjV1aXBnRRAB,Woodfire pizza and a relaxed atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN19yZ2t3RRAB,"We had a birthday party at Ruyi and went with 7 course set menu. Everything was just perfect, the food was 10/10. Service is so friendly and easygoing at the same time on very high level. Chicken wings, ceviche were some of the favourites"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScC11TzVnRRAB,"Artful menu that translated in vibrant fresh deliciousness. We had 7 course set menu, each course presented as a story on the plate. And as for the service, we thank RuYi team for the friendliest and most attentive wait service we have experienced anywhere in the world."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjlyWFZnEAE,"Had dinner here with my partner and my daughter for her 21st birthday. Restaurant is lovely, modern and clean. Service was friendly and efficient and the food was spectacular. They topped it off with a special dessert for the birthday girl. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this place more highly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzhPRlR3EAE,Had a great family dinner at RuYi. Loved everything that was served and also the atmosphere of this place. The staffs are very nice and have great knowledge of the food and which wine to pair them with.  Can wait to explore more on my next visit to Melbourne.  Keep it up! Reney
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzZxbE9nEAE,"Amazing dining experience at RuYi. Foods are so yummy, clean place, good vibes and good quality of service. Definitely will come back again next time we visiting Melbourne :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZy1xTDZBRRAB,"RuYi has a well designed menu with great gluten free items. The soft shell crab was delicious and nicely complemented by the wine. It is a busy, bustling place with very attentive service. Tofu and noodle salad are also very delicious ‚ô•Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWVpZmFBEAE,Worst Chinese food I've had in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNV9iLW1nRRAB,"Excellent meal, such lovely and interesting flavours. Eggplant chips, bao and pork dumplings were fanastic, as was dessert tasting plate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWFHdk9BEAE,Best Asian fusion food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLVlYa0RBEAE,"Excellent service and food, thanks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3BxUzVnRRAB,One of the best hidden gems in the city. You honestly can't go past this restaurant without stopping for some amazing food and hospitality. A must for foodies!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMWZIU0hREAE,"Disappointed.  Had such good reviews so decided to try it out.   Very tiny portions, no veggies at all with the meats.  Most dishes dunked in soya sauce.  Fish was tasteless.  No wonder restaurant was almost empty. Could have fared much better in heaps of other restaurants with far less reviews Disapponted"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocHVPdzVRRRAB,Must visit! One of the best dining experiences you can imagine. I am pretty sure this restaurant will be rewarded with lots of awards! It‚Äôs modern Chinese food in a lovely atmosphere. Fine dining with a focus on delicious well balanced meals with aromatic flavours. They are vegan friendly! You will have lots of vegan options to choose from. Every dish was top notch The interior is stunning and the setting is gorgeous. Relaxed atmosphere in general. Service is great as well. This place deserves a Michelin star üí´ I had the following and can highly recommend them: Lettuce cup Fried soft tofu Szechuan eggplant fries Very fresh and pure flavours. Also their drinks are perfect and fit well with the menu. Probably the best in Melbourne!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocXIydDRnRRAB,Absolutely amazing! Everyone please ask for Mercy when you go here. She is friendly and has amazing recommendations. Absolutely great food and service. Thank you Mercy!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeW9LN2RREAE,"The service attitude here is very good, the meal style is very unique, and the fusion of Chinese and Western. The beef and Kingfish here are particularly delicious, and we had a very pleasant meal here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaE1TaUNBEAE,"Had an amazing time in RUYI Restaurant with my lovely family. I came here because one of the friends of mine recommended this place. It was beyond my expectation, not like the usual Chinese food, RUYI served the next level kind of Chinese food, I loved it!! Especially the Tofu and the Baramundi, they were really amazingly tastyyy üòã The service was great, all the staffs were so lovely. I would love to come back again next time. ü•∞"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaE9TMGZBEAE,Excellent fine dining restaurant in town! Love everything üíõüíõüíõüíõ
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaE9pRGRnEAE,"Great experience!! I‚Äòd really recommend this beautiful restaurant to everyone! Delicious food, cozy vibes, amazing wine, great service. We had a great time here with family. Thank you RuYi! Definitely will be back ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod0lqekFnEAE,Not normally one to enjoy modern Chinese food but this restaurant was excellent. Really tasty and good quality food and excellent service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCczR5YW53RRAB,"I decided to take my husband to RuYi for his birthday and I don't even know where to start. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. The service and food was impeccable. We love Chinese food however RuYi takes it to a level we have never experienced. Every dish was well balanced flavour wise. The dishes were perfectly sized, the smells will make you drool. We went over board in regards to what we ordered however it was worth every bite and the process of rolling out of there, We ordered the numbing beef and pork ribs with steamed rice and fried rice as mains which can only be described as wow. Cover your mouth, stop chewing. wow. The small plates were insane as well. Overall I would give it 6 stars out of 5. THANK YOU TO THE TEAM AT RUYI for an amazing dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd2IzSkRREAE,Really hip and modern interior coupled with interesting and very tasty food. Really modern vibe
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbXJxU2JnEAE,Contemporary Chinese cooking in a modern space with great cocktails.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNTYzU3dnRRAB,Lots of Asian favourites done well as part of set menu but wasn‚Äôt wowed unfortunately.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCallyREVBEAE,"Overall a pleasant experience! Staff were lovely, sauces were amazing! The dumplings themselves were a little bland, but the texture of the dumplings wrappers was fantastic. The sauces had a great mix of bitter, sweet and spicy. The chilli wonton weren‚Äôt spicey, however the sauce they were served in was incredible. The crispy chicken with honey wasabi sauce was incredible, again not too spicey, but the chicken had an amazing crunchy crumb. The only real letdown was the kong bao. According to the menu it is mild spicy, but it was so spicy I couldn‚Äôt eat it, to the point it was actually hurting my tongue to eat. This was unfortunate as it presented beautifully and the first mouthful I could taste was amazing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMmRlNEhnEAE,Great service and good food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa2JqeUtREAE,"Had my Christmas dinner here 2 years in a roll. Peking duck wraps, grilled prawns, toufu were all very delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOTRHUl9RRRAB,"The first time I dined at this hidden little gem was back in 2016.  Dishes are prepared with simple ingredients in a way that it brings out the best of the ingredients and letting the ingredients being the centre of attention.  I do have to say, a lot of thoughts has been put into interpreting what is Chinese food, and what is the most appropriate interpretation of modern Chinese.  During the years I visit this place from time to time, sometimes enjoying the chef‚Äôs menu, sometimes ordering my favourite dishes and go nuts with rice. The menu changes from time to time, but the quality and taste always impresses and challenge my taste buds."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bU95OHZRRRAB,"High quality Chinese cuisine with a large menu, lovely staff and restaurant üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaFlEV2V3EAE,"Been to lunch at BH on a Friday many times over past 6 years - always excellent! Went last Friday for lunch with a couple of friends and the food was absolutely top notch!  It lace was packed and buzzing - service was excellent still.  I have dined recently in many other regarded top Chinese Restaurants including Silks, Flower Drum and Chois and I can state categorically that BH is as good and most likely better - amazing and well done!!  Will be back soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3MzQ1pnEAE,"One of the best chinese restaurant in Melb! The food and service is good! The amazing Peking duck is something must try! Staff is friendly and considerate, helped me with my baby with pram! Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3V2RFd3EAE,Top quality. Top service. Not cheap but you do get what you pay for.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUtxV1R3EAE,Cannot recommend Bamboo House highly enough!! They are truly a dining experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDZhNnpRRRAB,Staff were very kind. The food was good and reasonably priced. Lovely table cloths etc. Highly recommend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenFhaTN3RRAB,Good food and service

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc3VTTjB3RRAB,Great meal.  Had ithe meal and wine picked for us by Mr Paul Marra .   Great combo. Regret not taking photos for you.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobF92RnhnRRAB,"Service is amazing, can be loud at times, food is great. Doesn't split bills."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcklteXBBRRAB,"Unbelievable great food, Unbelievable the best service I've ever had, 3 times now I've been here over 4 years ever time we come to Melbourne. We were in the best room in the restaurant, just brilliant üëè üëå"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajhqQzRnRRAB,Please stop dumping your waste and grease on the side walk. We will be reporting you to the council.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdXVYRGFBEAE,"*UPDATED REVIEW* the Peking duck was served lukewarm and chewy on my most recent visit here, and the wonton soup was tasteless. Maybe the kitchen staff have been changed? Very disappointing to see this restaurant‚Äôs standard regress. I cannot recommend this place for Peking duck anymore.  Original review: Bamboo House is home to the best Peking Duck in Melbourne! Amazing experience, the staff are attentive and accommodating, all the dishes are delicious, and the restaurant caters for families too. This place will be my regular from now on!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOWFPNG1BRRAB,Amaz8ng food with sensational service and a beautiful ambience. Great for bringing business guests to when you need to subtly impress.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdXVTWTZBRRAB,"Had excellent food and very courteous service. The restaurant is very nice and the selection on the menu is very varied, as is the selection of wines. All in all we had a nice evening üòÉ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod3J6R3pnRRAB,Fine dinning at its best the best calamari I have ever tasted the beef so tender I couldn't fault anything really  maybe the fried rice I have had better ..with more ingredients.  Had the banquet ...we were both really full
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNUtiRzlnRRAB,Thank you to Ben who was our waiter for the night...we had a lovely meal. Best fried rice in Melbourne. Will definitely be back!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaE1ERHV3RRAB,Great staff. The food was delicious. Had a great dinner with an old friend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdzh1LWhBRRAB,The food and the customer service was faultless - would definitely recommend and will definitely be back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNN3MzVkJBEAE,"Two stars because our waiter was polite, professional and timely.  Will not return. Too sweet, and they served ketchup with the Sichuan duck we preordered. I have no words."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVMkpEQ3d3RRAB,"Lovely atmosphere, service excellent,  food very good lots of attention  to detail a very good evening, drinks generous"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeUozenB3RRAB,Outstanding Chinese food.White omelette with Lobster and Peking Duck is amazing. Good wine list and great service. Annie is great with a good sense of humour
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcDVxTVZnEAE,"Made a last minute reservation for 13 and turned out to be a happy happenstance. Food was delicious, and the service was impeccable. All in all would definitely recommend this place if you're craving elevated Chinese food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcTR2MUxnEAE,Had lunch with a group of 14 friends. What a magnificent spread of food served by very professional people. This has to be the best Chinese restaurant that I have been to in many years. üëè bravo ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdmRpWWpnRRAB,üëéüëé ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU5TbmdRRRAB,ABSOLUTELY sensational! We had the favourites banquet and all I can say was YUM. From the prawn dumplings to the whole fish. My absolute favourite was the fried chicken bao bun and the COCONUT rice was out of this world. Def going back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzliVDVRRRAB,Food comes fast but is mediocre. The interior of the restaurant is however amazing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzZTampBRRAB,"Excellent fried rice, decent GF dumplings. Got busy quick on a weekday lunchtime but service was still fast. Quite noisy, so better for a party night than a romantic evening"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSai15N3hBRRAB,"Fantastic Asian fusion in a great location! Busy spot so be sure to book, with great food and drinks!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDkyTzZ3RRAB,"Food OK but not my favourite although tasty. Service was great - no problems there at all. Cocktails are a must though! Were good. Way too much in the betel leaf so hard to eat/prawns not cut up in small pieces and didn't have option to use the ingredients yourself. The chicken stir fry was OK, just nothing to rave home about to me because was really just roasted chicken basically with a bunch of vegetables which was a bit salty I think. Definitely not a Vietnamese fusion to me, more like a northern Chinese Asian Fusion to me. Some spice for sure but this is to me is an overhyped place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbThQRERnEAE,"The food is really tasty, but we were a group of six so we had to get the banquet and it was really impractical as the table in the booth was far too small to fit all the dishes and some of the dishes require you to carve the meat off bones, which is very difficult if there is barely room for the dish on the table! I suggest rethinking how meals are presented and also how many dishes come out at once so the table isn't so crammed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScS15MFpnEAE,Best Asian fusion
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazdhT3ZRRRAB,"Went out for a birthday dinner, the place had good vibes overall, great friendly service, the food was quite expensive and probably not entirely worth how much it all cost because most of what we had was coconut curry lamb, duck, pork. The entr√©es were unique and quirky- probably what i enjoyed the most. If i were to revisit it would be for the ambience of the place, maybe we‚Äôll just grab drinks next time haha"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmJQSHJnRRAB,"Very helpful servers. The food was incredible. Very flavoursome and delicious, especially the duck crisps and Mama's fried rice. Good cocktails too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamVubzRBRRAB,Got a seat by window Very good autumn vibe(as the yellow leaf fall slowly out side and opposite building look beautiful)  Food is tasty reccomend to eat with plain rice as it will too salty. I made mistake by order with fried rice. Anyway they taste good. Order 1 cocktail (cause its a lunch!)  Learnt that Greygoose pair well with pear  Hope you guys enjoy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbFlLemVnEAE,Selected this place to eat based on its name and it did not disappoint! Reservations highly recommended. Great ambience and vibe. Excellent customer service and the food is truly a mouth watering experience with each bite. Enjoyed every dish - especially the Roast Duck crisps and Vietnamese  Slaw. I don‚Äôt even like beef ribs but the Sticky Beef Rib was falling off the bone and packed with flavor. A must try if you‚Äôre looking for a Vietnamese/ Asian fusion that your tastebuds and tummy will enjoy! I‚Äôll be back soon!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmZxRmNREAE,"5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è for both food and service! I went there yesterday with my colleagues for a farewell banquet and when I say the service was fantastic... I'm not exaggerating.  I have many dietary needs and the server we had went out of their way to listen and note all of my needs and made sure to substitute/customise the meals as best as they good so I could eat and enjoy the entirety of the banquet. Honestly... I have never felt more seen in my life hahaha I'm saddened that I did not catch their name but the had coloured hair and were WONDERFUL.  Overall, the food and service were all an absolute delight. Would DEFINITELY come back for another meal one day soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWV5VG1RRRAB,"If you‚Äôre looking for amazing Thai food in Melbourne, this place is your go to. The banquet option is such an amazing selection for sharing with a group. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff were very accommodating, and took the time to explain items on the menu. There was so much food to go around and is definitely a place I would revisit"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHF5Y0pBEAE,Very Tasty food. Good for sharing food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2NmMTF3RRAB,Superb. Pricing quite high though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3R6ZVhnEAE,"Good starters, average quality mains for that price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOW96VEJnEAE,Wow! Their crab fried rice was so delicious I would go back for more in a heartbeat! Great vibe in a quieter part of little bourke.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHJHT0ZBEAE,Had the feed me now menu and each dish was so tasty. There was an insane amount of food too. Highly recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZ5M2FREAE,Went to Hochi Mama for the third time last night and was pretty disappointed. Have ran back here each time because the food was always so delicious and vibes always high. This time the food was pretty bland besides the lamb curry (our favourite) Probably just a bad night but definitely worth visiting. Feed Me menu is soooo good for your money and cocktails are delish!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXU3bnRRRRAB,Amazing and affordable food and experience. Would highly recommend - the staff were particularly good at catering to my dietary restrictions as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3JlSHlBRRAB,Food was delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXBDZk9nEAE,"Worst coffee.. Boiling hot, destroyed the flavour, full of aerated bubbles, and only three quarters of a cup.  Left a disgusting taste in mouth. If you want a good coffee.. avoid this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXBEVkZREAE,"We ordered 2 coffees, one latte and one cappuccino, both were boiling that we could not hold the cups and both cups had 3/4 liquid in it. I say liquid as what we had was not coffee but a disgusting beverage probably cause the drink was boiled too long. AVOID THIS PLACE, fast food coffee would an upgrade to Federici Bistro coffee!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWQzM3Z3RRAB,"This is great old timey looking cafe attached to the Princess Theatre, named after the ghost, famously rumoured to haunt the theatre, Frederici.  Have had meal in here before seeing Harry Potter but thought overpriced for what it was, but popular because of its location, so should try at least once when visiting theatre.  Or not, of course."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5OEsyQ2RnEAE,Great coffee and service. Will be coming back again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjMkotdXdnRRAB,Nice little bistro on the side of the road
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNM0tDOW1RRRAB,"Expensive, staff are young and don‚Äôt smile. Extra star for good coffee. Good place to waste time"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNc2VfeTBBRRAB,Amazing service and food. Everything was perfect and enjoyed it so much. Thank you
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwZ283clFBEAE,"Waited for 40 mins for a completely burnt toastie, salty, I‚Äôm glad there barely any salmon in it because it‚Äôs not fresh at all. Rude consumer services."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbk8zX3ZRRRAB,"horrible service, waited over 30 minutes for a  bagel and pre-made salad and several tables who ordered after us received their meals before us, even after pointing out that tables before us has already received our meals still took over 15 minutes to prepare."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNEt6aE93EAE,The Canolli was muy Delicioso and great customer service!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwZ04zRWRREAE,"Excellent place to eat, especially if you are going to the PrincessvTheatre.  The staff know how long you have and make sure you get your meal in time.  The food was great and the staff excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdTZlVHpBRRAB,Really convenient to theatre and great food. Friendly service

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwM3VHdUJ3EAE,"We had eggs and smashed avo on sour dough as well as good quality Melbourne latte. The waitress and counter staff were all lovely, friendly and efficient.  The food was very reasonably priced for downtown Melbourne and the cakes and sandwiches looked fresh and delicious."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0cUktOWJREAE,Loved it for ages
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZazVySmpBRRAB,Always delicious food and great service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdXYyN0tBEAE,"Yummy lunch, friendly staff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z0xlRzJnRRAB,"Mid century decor with well spaced dining tables and bar tables. Casual, friendly and kind service. We had a good chat to Johan who was witty and welcoming. All meals were unique and tasty and presented well. I ventured to the tongue and heart meals so that gives you an idea of the menu. Excellent beer selection, Pinot Gris and with a big wow for the Sangiovese."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z003T0JREAE,Amazing food and great service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTZpSFF3EAE,Very cosy vibe and friendly staff. Will be coming back for more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenZuSWFnEAE,"Went to Amphlett House with the family which included young people of school age and we all thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience, the staff are tremendous and very helpful and nothing too much trouble. The ambience is very pleasing, easy going and makes for a very comfortable place to either sit and have a long drink or a fabulous cocktail and watch the world go by. The food was the icing on the cake! They cater for vegans which is quite a rarity and it certainly did not disappoint! My granddaughters are both Vegan and thoroughly enjoyed their meals which is so refreshing to be able to all eat out and be catered for together with all different requirements ( great stuff!) The rest of our party had various other dishes and all the plates were left clean!  I myself had the Mussels which as others have said, were utterly delicious and yes I too left a clean plate! The menu is sensible and wonderfully varied but not bombarding,  prices are very reasonable too and right in the theatre district, its well well worth a visit anytime, you will not be disappointed, check it out!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanEycWx3RRAB,"Had a very delicious meal here on our first night in Melbourne City, lovely atmosphere, great staff who are very attentive, the food was superb and we were not rushed, we even had a visit from the chef. Wonderful experience, Would recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanRXdU9BEAE,"Excellent food, great menu choice. Food was served in good time. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere. Wil definitely be dinning there again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanNyQzdBRRAB,Been to Amplett House a few times now. Food is next level with excellent service. Will definitely be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZDRmtRRRAB,"Chef Ian Curley has done it again - this place is seriously good. There‚Äôs a nice, intimate, gastropub feel that offers some intimacy from the attached hotel and the bustle of Little Bourke.  There are a few veg options but the menu is protein dominant and mostly British-inspired. The ox tongue and the harissa spiced fish scotch egg are must-try dishes and err more on the playful side of pub fare. The mussels are also standout.  Cocktails are great too but if that‚Äôs not your thing, there‚Äôs also a large and varied selection of craft beer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0t5MU9REAE,"The food and service was amazing with a great beverage list with a good selection of craft beers, local.and international wines and cocktails."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWVTbS1nRRAB,"Enjoyed the food, staff friendly, knowledgeable about food and wine, service was good, not intrusive,  atmosphere and decor classy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHBUS3RRRRAB,"Good food, friendly staff, great atmosphere. The perfect place to grab a drink and a meal after work."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbE1yVFdnEAE,"Wow what a find.  Great food, delicious cocktail but best of all the best customer service I have ever experienced.  Everyone was so pleasant, happy and genuinely cared that we enjoyed ourselves. Wishing all success"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobjhTV2l3RRAB,Good happy hour deals on for after work drinks
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjVlY0xBEAE,"A laid back vibe,great service and the best Negroni I've tasted. We will come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodko3VFNREAE,Best fish and chips I ever tried! Beautiful pub atmosphere too. Great customer service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoel9hMmxnRRAB,Totally amazing!!! Kept going back during my stay in Melbourne. Everything on the menu is 1st class. Staff are the best around. So attentive and made us feel so at home. Can't wait for my next Melbourne holiday just so I can go back there.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeTZmaFZBEAE,"What a wonderful place tucked away at the top of little Bourke St. It would be an ideal place for a meal before or after a show (eg Harry Potter or Mary Poppins etc). I love this place , delicious wholesome meals, wonderful, fun & friendly service. This was my 2nd visit in 3 weeks. Did not post any photos after our initial meal as they were so delicious, they were all eaten up quickly. This time, I came prepared & took some before tucking in. Highly recommend for carefully prepared French influenced food, great service and convenient location üíñüåü. PS my dining partner had the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e with freshly baked (to order) madeleines and the BEST chocolate sauce. Do yourself a favour and try this place #notsponsored"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocGJUWWlnRRAB,Great service and delicious food. Highly recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek9ENDBnRRAB,"Everything came together at this place - delicious meals and drinks at reasonable prices; a chill, comfortable vibe that was extremely easy to spend a couple of hours in; and very friendly staff that made us feel extremely welcome. Would definitely come back again!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLUlTbWZ3EAE,"Pretty chill vibe at Amphlett House.  Not sure why I paid $18 for a ""High Ball"".. It was just a Gin and Tonic...  Got some entrees to share before heading to another venue. The duck parfait had a strange grainy texture and weird after taste. Wouldn't recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdTlfNlR3EAE,"Cozy restaurant. We stoped by without reservation. We had excellent service by Chris and all the staff. The food was good, but not exceptional. I would recommend for anyone who wants to have a decent meal at a decent price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb1l6bmNBEAE,"The most sincere of staff!  A hole in yhe wall spot, perfect dare location  Whilst the menu is limited, it's execution was fantastic. The food was delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd2ZQLV9BRRAB,I had such an amazing time at Amphlett House on Monday 14/1. The food was impeccable and the service (I think our servers name was Chris) was amazing! He was a great laugh and made our experience even better! I would most definitely go again !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCajlMLWpRRRAB,"We had dinner here with our family of 5, so convenient for the theatre nearby. Such a great venue with amazing food, drinks and service. Our waitress Ali was exceptional and couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMUpyX2pnRRAB,Absolutely delicious food and drinks paired with great service. Highly recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaXI2Yjl3RRAB,"Thanks for the delicious breakfast, food tasty coffee excellent and service friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLamQ3eVFBEAE,"Went for breakfast this morning,  my partner and I both got the 'Big Breakie' with a side of beans (homemade baked beans which tasted very wholesome), they were nearly the best bit! Lovely staff,  the breakfast was honestly delicious,  fresh orange juice also!! Would definitely recommend and go again! Thanks again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa0p6R2FnEAE,"Ordered avocado on toast with fried eggs ( had requested fried eggs) as the original recipe said poached , the guy on the counter said oh we can definitely do fried eggs, when the order came through got poached eggs . Ordered for a mocha,  got a cappuccino told the guy on the counter he said oh sorry and just hot me a chocolate sauce on the side to make my own mocha !! What away to ruin the morning ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvcDdxQzJRRRAB,"UPDATE: SEE BELOW.  So It's been one heck of a year. So you can imagine my enthusiasm to come back to the cafe where it all began... It is to my dismay to inform you all...... ""The Benny"" is gone.  We returned twice after COVID hoping to see The Benny in all its glory. To have our tastebuds touched by an angel once more. It seems the cook has either changed, or those wonderous drops of balsamic reduction and pesto have packed up and moved away.  I beg of you if you read this review, please inform me when they have returned from their holiday.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Old Review Jan 2020  I dont usually write reviews, but buckle in for this bad boy...  Atmosphere here is great for a sunday brunch catch up with family or friends.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict, ""Benny"" they call it and my lord was it good.. The poached eggs were the best eggs I have ever laid my eyes on. Wasnt sure if I was going to eat them or propose to them. Everything about the meal was delicious right down to the little drops of garnish on the side.  Ordered a Caramel latt√® and low and behold.... you bet your bottom dollar it was great...  Service here is friendly and don't pester you about how your food tastes during your first mouthful.  Now.... for the payment.. greeted with friendly staff once again and to my surprise didnt have to sell a kidney...  All in all, would I recommend this place? You bet ya I would. Will I come back? Definitely.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NEtuMmNREAE,Love the big breakfast!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4XzUzT3N3RRAB,"Friendly staff, amazing food. Great place for breakfast and lunch!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcWVtdktnEAE,"Food was absolutely amazing one of the best breakfasts I've had, great options for everyone. Staff are very nice. 5/5"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzX095dHF3RRAB,"Very nice place, food is good. Service is quick and friendly. Recommended for breakfast or coffee , could  be good for lunch as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNjk2YzR3RRAB,Quick. Got a flat white and a long black. Very friendly and welcoming staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdXVyeC1RRRAB,"We had a great experience at this cafe this morning. The food is delicous and the perfect mix of decadent, fresh and yummy! The freshly squeezed juice was inviting to drink. The serving staff and chef are very friendly. I would highly recommend you eat here. Thankyou for our great start to the day."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzaE0zbTlRRRAB,Cozy ambiance with a nice half inside/half outside vibe. Food was tasty and staff friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdTg2RUlnEAE,"Phancy Start is my favorite dish, delicious chai latte and fast friendly service. Always accommodating to my kids :) thanks Max and team üëç ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNN2JyQXh3RRAB,Just great food and quiet.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNLWZqdnFBRRAB,Best coffee and do a mega size. Made this our go to for coffee for the whole week we were in Melbourne. Breakfast great too!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcHFyLXZBRRAB,Had a great meal. The people were very friendly and lovely. Nice to see people smile while at work üòÄ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwaEstZ0FREAE,"It doesn't look like much from outside, but the food is incredible and the service is pretty good too - food came out fast."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNTltWnNBRRAB,"Solid food, and some decent specials üëå All day breakfast is always appreciated. The relish on the burger was delicious! ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwN2ZIYXdBRRAB,Perfect for us. Ample seating. The second day we went for breakfast it was busier but still wasn't 'loud' . Enjoyed the soft piano music and comfy decor. Staff were efficient and friendly. Coffee great and the chef cooks up delicious breakky fare. A cheery place amongst a grey Melbs cityscape.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0lHS21RRRAB,All good to be honest! It was raining the whole night but they have containers so you don't have to worry about it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSallMSW5nRRAB,"Probably the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The atmosphere on the rooftop is amazing. Even on a cold night they had plenty of heating up there so it's a place for summer and winter. The service we got there was probably the best I've ever received at a restaurant. The staff were so lovely. The food was immaculate, definitely recommend the Quesabirrias. The flavor in ever dish was so amazing. The price of the food was also very reasonable for what you get. Definitely will be coming back here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWJPeXBBRRAB,"Service really slow, cocktails premixed and guacamole not fresh. Way too over priced for what it is. View is good though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGNickxREAE,Best margaritas and tostadas in town! üòåü§§ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN29fOXNRRRAB,"Very good service !!  The food is very good, a very nice place! The pirate taco not to forget! üòÅ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenFMWnVBRRAB,"Great place, the best Mexican food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXRiY0JnEAE,"Lovely atmosphere on the roof top, don‚Äôt worry, there is heaps of shade and tables in remodelled shipping containers. Food was fantastic, saturday also seems to incur a surcharge. For the price you pay, the portions of meat are better than any other taco place I‚Äôve had. Staff were very friendly, you can also order form your table. The CBD restaurant has a different menu than their other location, there are no beef tacos here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnFmSlNBEAE,"excellent service, delicious dishes and nice !!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnNmS2xRRRAB,Excellent service would come back again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnNlWXh3RRAB,the service and food is excellent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbklfUFhnEAE,"Beautiful place, great drinks and food. Had a great time with my Friends there!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN0pmQk1BEAE,"Had a great time here! The food was super tasty and staff were so friendly. Really impressed! Thanks so much guys, we will definitely be back üòä also try the Quesabirrias, they are my new favourite dish!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN1B1c3JnRRAB,"Wonderful food and dining experience, the team are awesome and friendly too, I definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for authentic and a variety of Mexican goodness, 10/10."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc0tucGdBRRAB,"Absolutely would not recommend. I'm a bit shocked by the good reviews it has, makes me think they might be fake reviews. We were sitting in piles of water as the shipping containers were getting flooded. We got the fish tacos and it was most likely frozen fish fingers deep fried with mayo on top. Despite being deep fried the fish came out cold.. the guacamole on the ""nachos"" was basically the stuff you get pre made at supermarkets. Incredible disappointing as it's supposed to be a Mexican restaurant, the least you expect is a fresh guac.  The wait staff were nice at least."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc01IZnNBRRAB,The best Mexican Restaurant in the CBD.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc056eU5nEAE,"Can't say I was happy at the Happy Mexican Rooftop. But first let's start with the good. Drinks were lovely and I'd recommend coming here for drinks. The Mexican pale ale was nice and the cocktails were decent, albeit expensive at $21 a pop. Staff were also trying really hard in some really ordinary weather.  The food on the other hand was some of the worst I've had in Melbourne. Fish tacos were just a bit of battered deep fried fish with red cabbage and a ton of mayonnaise, not nice. The eggplant tacos were just fried eggplant with no proper sauce and simply tasteless. The nacho chips were ok but the guacamole reminded me of the guac dip you get at the supermarket.  In a nutshell I wouldn't recommend coming here for food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa0lQdzNRRRAB,"Good luck, it is an authentic Mexican restaurant, delicious food very well prepared, drinks well served, regards"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE1tTmxRRRAB,Excellent and very good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNElIcnNnRRAB,"Excellent vibes, nice hosts and delicious dishes, I would love to come back here and I definitely recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNExxMHdRRRAB,"Very nice place, excellent service and delicious food. I recommend it"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb1BLUFZ3EAE,"Amazing place in the middle of the CBD, great drinks and authentic Mexican food. Plus stunning views"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0xqazB3RRAB,"Awesome place with great atmosphere, authentic and very tasty mexican food, 4 great beers from The Grumpy Mexican on tap. Would highly recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd09tSnZBRRAB,"Good food, good music, nice staff, good view. Such a good venue. Loved the chilaquiles with beef üëåüèΩüëåüèΩ ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd01tbzZ3RRAB,"Beautiful place and nice vibes. Excellent service and tasty food. If you want to have fun with a fusion of music, food and drinks you must visit this rooftop!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0pyemdRRRAB,"Great place, very colourful and vibrant. Definitely my go to place for a good time after a busy day in the city. The food and drinks are out of this world and the staff is super friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0pENzVRRRAB,"If you're looking for a great Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food and has an amazing view from a rooftop, then this place is definitely worth checking out!!! The atmosphere of the restaurant is top-notch, with an open-air setup that provides an unforgettable experience.  The highlight of this restaurant is the impressive selection of craft beers, particularly the hazy pale ale, I simply love it!! It's definitely worth trying if you're a beer lover.  As for the food, the chilaquiles with beef is the standout dish. It's well-prepared, perfectly seasoned, and absolutely delicious. The portion size is generous, making it a great value for the price.  Overall, if you're looking for a fantastic Mexican restaurant with a great rooftop view, awesome beer selection, and mouth-watering chilaquiles with beef, then this place is a must-visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjh1c3pRRRAB,Ordered chicken skin which is very crispy and taste nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScV9UdWdRRRAB,"Hot Star Large Fried Chicken Is a interesting place to grab a bite to eat, The Signature Fried Chicken is really nice n Crispy and Juicy with a few different flavoured seasoning to choose from."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeE1XUFVBEAE,There was only 6 pieces of mushrooms in the bag !!!!!!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3BldllBEAE,"Hey Team,  I‚Äôm disappointed on how your display your menu items in Food Delivery Partner platforms. (Eg: UberEats).  All your ‚Äòmeal‚Äô choices come with chips. But when we chose any meal bundles in UberEats (eg: Family) - it doesn‚Äôt go to the next page since both chips options (potato and sweet potato) are by default selected.  The page then loops back to us asking again to fill the ‚Äúrequired‚Äù field.  So if we want to buy these items - have to go back to the menu to individually select items (at higher price vs the bundle discount)!!!!  I would like to get an explanation for this to see why this is not a scam forcing customers to book at higher price? I‚Äôve screenshots. Bad experience! Disappointed. (Everything about the food is great though. Nice work on that!)  Thanks!  EDIT: Update: On the very next day after this review, the restaurant updated their UberEats options (for all store options at Melbourne). Thanks for that! (But they never acknowledged here - hopefully my feedback got noticed)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaHMyd29nRRAB,Made order and waited nearly 20 minutes as my order number disappeared from the ‚Äòpreparing‚Äô screen. Then they searched for the number and found that they had cause the order to fall underneath everyone else‚Äôs order. We then had to wait nearly another 10 minutes Thats close to half an hour for some chicken pop and muchroom while orders after us were already being completed ages ago. Very disappointed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzhDSUVBEAE,Ridiculous waiting time! Can‚Äôt believe only 1 staff working on Sunday! I waited half an hour for a single chicken!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodWNPRk9BEAE,Yummy and fresh. Best valued large chicken. Sides are great but small ‚òπÔ∏è but ok because taste great üëç  Found a good mix cheese and plum üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvbG9XQ3lnRRAB,"Chicken and sides not as good as used to be. Also the staff there dont even speak chinese which is really annoying! When I finished ordering in Chinese they came up with I don speak Chinese! Then I have to repeat my order once again! You should probably make a sign say that the staff don speak or understand Chinese so less confusion in ordering! Also the price has gone up by more than 10% however the service has not improved at all! Also chicken and side are not even close to when it was 8.5! when ask to sprinkle seasoning on both side the chicken, only answered no.we cant do that. Not sure what is wrong kr so hard to do. I guess i am not going to order from hot star any more if this is still going.  Very disappointing at this stage!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd2F5c09REAE,Sugar on fries and chicken?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMXJDRkhnEAE,"The large fried chicken is not as good as before, has the recipe changed?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdGRMeTBBRRAB,Missed the old staff and the old chicken style there. There is alot of change in recent time. Not a great place anymore
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdHBLT1FBEAE,"Expect to wait 30 minutes or above, seeing into the kitchen it's obvious they prioritize delivery orders instead of people ordering there"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtczZyVDB3RRAB,"Bought a chicken skin last night and it was full of fried food residue, won't go again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOXJqSEd3EAE,I was order and wait 30‚Äù minutes for chicken
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNWZES3Z3RRAB,"Bad store, worst service. I have been queing for 20minute and then it came to my turn to order and they said the store is closed. Never come back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMGJMaWVnEAE,"Hot Star has always been my favorite place to go to for Taiwanese style fried chicken. The battered coating is just so delicious and the seasoning selection is super tasty. It's my late night go-to fried chicken place whenever I crave for food at midnight üòÇ. Always get the Hot Star Chicken (the menu name lol), such a gigantic piece of chicken for $9 only. Need to look out for bones though. This store always has a lot of people but the ordering system is super efficient (use the touch screen in front), then you just stand there for around 5 minutes for your order to be prepared and your number to be called."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ek8yZXBBRRAB,The chicken was always good but this time the chicken schnitzel has such strong plastic bag‚Äôs flavor. Very disappointing
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cUxPVGJBEAE,"Had some delicious and cheap food. Only issue was I must have waited 20 minutes for the $5 snack pack, if I'd have known I honestly would have gone elsewhere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cjdYMWl3RRAB,My first time trying the food hear and it was amazing. Nice flavours and food is freshly made. I will be back.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bFpobRAB,Put a couple of the payment machines please. One bad group or person blocks the whole thing for too long and is causing you to lose customers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cFl6UHJnRRAB,Great for a late night snack and seems to be pretty busy from 10pm onwards
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMmY2d0lBEAE,"Had chicken, squid & chips with cheese seasoning and it was YUMMY!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXFPTGpnRRAB,"wait times are long, the food is not worth it. Chicken was salty and super dry. wasting times"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N0x6Zy1nRRAB,The best Korea bbq I ever had! Highly recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE5mNGVnEAE,"Served the worst cold noodles I've had. It tasted like chunks of sugar in iced cold water. Cold noodle is one of my favourite dishes, I've ate from a lot of different restaurants, this was just awful. Even the cold noodle packs you buy from asian marts are better. The samgyeopsal (Pork Belly) was ok, neither good or bad"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUo3cWJ3EAE,Highly recommended.  Haven‚Äôt dined in here before but ordered take away multiple times now. The beef is good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDlMSVdREAE,TTeokbokki
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSclo3MzVnRRAB,"Food perfect every single time I've been, staff treat customers very well"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWFEclNREAE,"We figured out they are really busy after the reviewing the reviews, so we decided too book ahead, big mistake, they run two shops in town, no mentioning about that. Hard for people out of town to figure that one out. We got greated with roundness at the door, from the lady in the front of house. That's good that they are busy but clear up your booking system, if you don't take booking for your cbd venue write it on your page. Make it clear to people that you only take walk ins. Really disappointed because we where looking forward to this experience and now we didn't enjoy it all. üò¢"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGYtNVFBEAE,"Very rude lady at the front desk, we reserved a table and were very excited to go there. When we arrived the waiter told us that there are no reservations and we should show her the reservation so we did. She said that‚Äôs a different restaurant and it‚Äôs our fault‚Ä¶we made the reservation by clicking on their Google maps webpage and reserve, how could we know that this is then their partner restaurant somewhere else. Instead of being friendly she was rude even she already seem to knew that we have a wrong reservation which definitely left the impression that this is how it happens every day. Thanks god we left this place and found a lovely Korean BBQ around the corner which we can highly recommend: Hawdam Korean BBQ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGR1ajZnRRAB,"Main dishes are great, skip the sides."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWFuNjdnRRAB,Always delicious. Love the unlimited sides. My family‚Äôs go to for kbbq.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanBUQ0lBEAE,Always a long queue whenever I passed by (yet the venue only accepts walk-in) so decided to try our luck for a late dinner.  I understand it now. Food was fantastic - especially the wagyu beef belly and ox tongue. Plus bonus there is someone to help you if you don‚Äôt know how to cook it yourself. yayyy. not to mention unlimited banchan (side dishes) - all equally yummy.  Highly recommended spot.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnF2X2lRRRAB,"Korean BBQ with various meats, there is beef, pork, quality meat, wagyu. Lots of side dishes, you can ask for more. Crowded visitors, queue"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjRTNFdBEAE,"Best krn bbq I've tried (and I've tried heaps)!  Everything is good except for the wait as it can get incredibly busy and they do walk-ins only. However it's well worth the wait as the food is delicious and the service is impeccable.  Hands-down, must visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODdHT0JBEAE,One of the best K-BBQ places I've been to in Melbourne so far! ‚úÖ High quality and juicy meats ‚úÖ Great service

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSck5taU1BEAE,Been here numerous time and it never disappoints. One of the best KBBQ in Melb.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUtlRlp3EAE,"Went on Sunday night around 6pm, there was already a line formed as they do not take bookings and we waited for about 30mins, the line moved progressively fast and we could have been seated sooner as there were seats available outside but we preferred to be seated inside. But it was absolutely worth the wait! Staff are super attentive, wagyu platter for two was 10/10 and side dishes were also really good, Would definitely come here again!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdUlfcU5BEAE,Fantastic BBQ with a impressive selection of beef wagyu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN19HTjh3RRAB,"Amazing food, great service, chill place to grab a bite with friends highly recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjVMaVBREAE,Staff were very rude while I was lining up. Decided to go elsewhere

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWVEcDR3RRAB,"Fried pork noodles dish is my fav, I always get mine with soup and with some sambal sauce but be careful as the sauce can be quite spicy. The pork noodle dish is also really good dry, so it depends what you like. The service here isn‚Äôt the best though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEl2R1JREAE,"Don't bother eating here. We've spent close to $60 for two and they want to charge $0.50 surcharge to buy single $0.50 take away container, I mean seriously, ACCC."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0lTS0xnEAE,I love the noodle with anchovies and spicy dried chilies
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScVlESVR3EAE,Prawn dumplings have almost no prawns  but really pork. and pan mee not available until after 2pm. Good noodles. Cash only under $20
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSanZHc0VnEAE,"Great place to dumpling soup, Jo Jo pork is the best thing ever ü§©ü§§. It‚Äôs closer to $20 per person . But yeah cool place overall"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNkpYV0Z3EAE,Had a great dinner with friends and good service with affordable food and drinks!  Great work!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodzdtN1BBEAE,The waitress was rude and the attitude was very poor
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod19qX2xRRRAB,Tasty!!!!!!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcG9mRjR3RRAB,"It was $60 for two people, and they were secretly charged a holiday fee of $8. There was no prior explanation. You are a black shop, right?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ2ZyckZREAE,Food was so good! And they were all really nice :) I'll go back for sure
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXFycEJ3EAE,"Decent pan mee but my overall dining experience was FAR below standard.  $1.50 for extra chilli. $15 minimum spend on card - a deliberate cash grab since their menu items are mostly $14.90.  Cold ""fried"" pork. Poor customer service from the staff who simply microwaved the cold ""fried"" pork and re-served it as if it had been freshly fried when I raised a complaint. Too many red flags to justify coming back here again.  Best to stay far away from this one. Stingy owners and disinterested staff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocW9xZmpBRRAB,‚ÄúNo Star Given‚Äù The food quality and the service is getting worse than before. I thought I can give them another chance. Nahhh‚Ä¶.Very disappointed!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDgtVDRnRRAB,"The two waiters here are very nice, and the food is delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM19YSmxBRRAB,Staff are very rude but the quality of the food makes up for it. Called to give courtesy of a notification for an order I had to cancel because the city was flooded and I couldn‚Äôt drive in.  The lady told me they don‚Äôt do cancellations - simply told her that they do now and hung up. I use another phone number to order now as they blocked that number for a while. Still 5 star experience food wise.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNV9XSEJ3EAE,"The service attitude of the beauties is very good, the smiling faces are welcoming, the noodles are very Q and the fried meat is delicious üòã The three-color milk tea and milk tea are all good! Worth to eat üëç"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWNlRHV3RRAB,delicious restaurant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c3NpazJnRRAB,"Good food and decently priced I had ordered chcken and corn dumplings and Mongolian beef with rice. Delivery time was a bit long but the food was great nonetheless.  The fried Beef dumplings were excellent!  Ordered beef curry with rice. Made it a full set with fried chicken and Coke ($16.80). This time, the food came very quickly and was very tasty!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobWNPanBnRRAB,WORST STAFF EVER! ESPECIALLY THE OWNER OR HIS SON!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3ItQi1BRRAB,"In front staff is really bad guy,that do not what he needs to do!!!!!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobDRiR0ZnEAE,I went there today. I picked up my order just 1 order. It toke more than 40 minutes wow. There were many riders but They have couple staffs. Must be improved
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMHBQT2J3EAE,This will be one of the best restaurants for my dinner after work. Highly recommend to try the Red Braised Pork Belly with rice and also the Saut√©ed Mongolian Beef with rice. They also have the set meal for you with any rice set option + fried chicken and a can of drink for $16.80 (mine is the tea so it was $17 in total). But of course it‚Äôs worth the money you paid.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMUxfT1FREAE,"Delicious and affordable, I‚Äôll come again next time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobExhYUVBEAE,Slow service as the name suggests but good value for money. Surprisingly ubereats prices are lower than dine in.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCam9DbV9RRRAB,Best customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced! So funny and inviting. Food was great too. Recommend the Chinese spirits üê§üê§
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc19mZVlREAE,Amazing price for really good dumplings
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLXZTX0N3EAE,"Came for a visit from Sydney, an wanted something quick and tasty.  OMG did this restaurant deliver. I had the best braised beef brisket with broccolini & stir fried rice W chicken in soy sauce‚Ä¶.I would highly recommend them too anyone I know visiting. <3"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOTlPMlRBEAE,absurd. 30 min for take away.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMjVfMEVBEAE,Awful service. Food took over an hour
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX292MldBEAE,Food takes around an hour.  Place had a person sleeping in the back of the store.  Could hear the cleaner having a domestic with the Chef.  Springrolls came out FROZEN and my wife still cant let it go.  Nothing can fix
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtenZ2TGlBRRAB,Super slow and rude staff member
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMta0otdW1nRRAB,"Braised beef brisket rice, there is a hair, 2/3 of the chicken nuggets are flour, the taste is salty, the price is medium, the rice is full, barely enough"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtb0tEeEpnEAE,It‚Äôs rather unsettling seeing employees reaching into rice cooker with bare hands. Please improve sanitation standard.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlajltakl3EAE,"Walked in a few of us, sat down and waited to be served. No one bothered to greet or explain whether needed to order at counter or not, no menu given. We walked out after waiting 5 -10mins with not a care in the world from employees. Floor was extremely greasy which definitely is a ohs hazard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDZTX0N3EAE,One of the worst restaurants I‚Äôve been in Melbourne. Long wait and rude staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN295ZGN3EAE,"Chicken instead of pork in Singapore noodles is not ideal but still okay over all. The fried wontons were good. Reasonable price, fairly quick delivery."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNW9XeGRnEAE,"long wait, reduced portions, food tastes bad. hope they go out of business soon"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbk51LXJ3RRAB,Just ordered a meal from here through Uber Eats and I have to say it was shockingly bad. Possibly the worst order I've ever received. I ordered pork slices with rice and cucumber with soy sauce. There was way way too much salt and msg. It was inedible. I threw it out. The only thing I kept was the rice. Will never order from this place again. If you value your precious life then stay far away from this here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1blp2VUVnEAE,Long  wait
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cGJtVGJ3EAE,waiting the food for more than 1 hour. Not coming here again. Wasting time and money! And the food is not tasty! This restaurant  is messy and dirty!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N3ZMVFpnEAE,Absolutely terrible service. Waited more than an hour and a half for food. When asked they said the food wasnt done yet. After an hour recieved the wrong order then waited for a further 30 minutes before complaining to the boss and the cashier said they lost the receipt. All i got was a sorry. never coming back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnEtNUtBEAE,Dinky little Chinese eatery with excellent food and horrendous serviceüòÖwill come by again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDVmUnFRRRAB,Coffee was good Dessert was fresh
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdC1Dbkl3EAE,Expensive and very poor coffee
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOF9UREp3EAE,"It‚Äôs a bit hard to find but worth the minor hunt. A cute little robot served us our food, which was a fun touch. The menu seems to be changing frequently but we enjoyed every meal when we went. Real good stuff, great flavours and spice levels, and the coffee was great too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMlp6ZHdBRRAB,Enjoyed the quality of coffee and food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGFTTlJREAE,"Ube waffles were delicious!  However the bacon and egg sandwich was REALLY salty, I tried to remove the bacon to see if that fixes it but even the egg just had whole chunks of salt in it, we told the server but they did nothing to reconcile the issue. I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt meant to be THAT salty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnZEM3JnRRAB,"Amazing food, attentive staff. Will bring more friends next time"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScE5UWVdBEAE,"The croissant is not bad, I don‚Äôt know what kind of vegetables are added in it, it‚Äôs very refreshing (it feels like pea tips)."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbFliQXlnRRAB,"BEST BRUNCH IN MELBOURNE! Everything here tasted amazing and the portions are seriously so generous.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaVluQ1FnEAE,Hidden gem. Went here with family from Sydney to try it out and doesn't disappoint. Food was amazing and service and hospitality was excellent. We look foward to coming back here again trying the other items on the menu

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLVlYRExnEAE,"Love the aesthetic vibes and beautiful interior of this place. We enjoyed everything we ordered.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb0tLd2dRRRAB,"What a hidden gem in fulton lane, offering an asian fusion brunch menu. I am impressed with the twice cooked short ribs, sooo tender and flavourful. The sweet potato chips on the side were also delicious. Banana split waffle is great for sharing as a dessert, i mean who can resist warm and fresh waffles topped with chocolate icecream and nutella?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDRmVlhBEAE,I have been coming to Morpha for a while. I always return because of Jarred and the amazing coffee he makes. I have oat milk latte and every single time the coffee is excellent. The milk is warmed to the perfect temperature and it's never burnt and the quality of the coffee is excellent. Bibi is a delightful server who is attentive and always smiling. I can not rave about this place enough. You will not be dissapointed coming here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeTUtVkRREAE,The best breakfast/ brunch we have ever had! The flavour and service is insane!!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXBqMGJBEAE,"Visited on Saturday with our pastor - serving staff were welcoming and fantastic to talk to, with some creative coffee froth-art. And the food servings were large and absolutely delicious. Our almost-two year old rarely eats a lot of breakfast and demolished a large chunk of pancakes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OU8tMU5REAE,"I am glad I walked in when it was heavily pouring outside. I asked to try ‚Äúsomething new‚Äù and bravely agreed to try this kinako latte on soy and salmon crumpet - no regrets, very sippable for a good half hour with a book. I love the vibes here and left feeling nurtured and grounded, it is decorated using lots of natural and earth colour. Feeling peaceful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NU16bU1BEAE,"It‚Äôs too bad, the cake I ordered is gone, I choose a new cake, it‚Äôs a piece more expensive than the previous one, I gave him 5 yuan in cash, and gave me 40 10cent coins, the staff‚Äôs English is also very bad, and the food in the store is only The photo looks good, the taste is really average, everyone should try to eat dessert instead of brunch"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUpDbVR3EAE,I love the ambience and the ichigo shortcakee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0pTYXBBRRAB,Lovely natural light + food that hits the spot. Matcha latte is a must try!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMTlmSkJREAE,"The store was so cute, but food was not good as I expected, maybe because I am Japanese though. The service was so good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHNyQ3BBRRAB,"Nice and enjoyable place with variety of yummy treats. My capuccino was great, and the girl was super attentive and smiling. Definitely be back during my stay here, highly recommended."

I like this place but service and getting stale obviously ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOUtYZThRRRAB,Japanese style cafe with cute interior. Love their strawberry shortcake
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODl6RnZ3RRAB,"nice vibe, the food looks good but the taste is normal for me"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbVA2dWtBRRAB,"Matcha pistachio jasmine shortcake: 7.5/10 Prana chai: 8/10 Soy latte: 7.8/10  All of my drink has rich creamy taste, which is blend well with the original taste of prana chai. Soy latte has rich soy powder flavour, which I like and not too sweet. The cake did not has rich pistachio flavor but do have heavy matcha flavor. I think it‚Äôs because the matcha flavor is already strong enough so the pistachio flavor did not stand out well and the creamy taste is just basic. It‚Äôs more like a matcha cake with rich creamy. But the atmosphere is 10/10. Has a large space and open till late night, so you can work here as well as hang out with friends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNVl6Z2V3EAE,"Fusion Japanese lunch and breakfast back again for other dishes , the new golden egg and waffle"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzZDY2FBEAE,"Very cute cafe with lots of seating area, cute cake slices and opted for the white sesame tiramisu one which initially just tasted like tiramisu but the flavour was very NUANCED anyways I said I wouldn‚Äôt eat the whole thing but ended up demolishing it lol but also the savoury dishes looked really good but unfortunately they don‚Äôt serve them during the afternoon"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2I3RkFREAE,"We loved brunch, specially lobster-scalloped meals, strawberries and green tea cake strongly recommended. Also, Jonathan is very good manager and provided quality services to every clients."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbEpIblZ3EAE,"If you‚Äôre in the mood for some exceptional cafe style Japanese cuisine, Ichigo is the perfect place to go.

The eel in the hitsumabushi was perfectly grilled. Likewise the egg was on point  and we had fun mixing the toppings which resulted in well balanced flavours. The ichi-rashi featured an array of fresh sashimi served over sushi rice. The presentation was beautiful and we enjoyed every bite! üòã The black sesame latte had a rich nutty flavour from the sesame paste. It was a nice complement to the other dishes we ordered. üôÇ Overall, Ichigo was a fantastic experience with a nice cosy atmosphere. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a casual cafe brunch or a full hearty Japanese meal, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!‚Ä®‚Ä®‚≠êÔ∏è Our rating: 8.5/10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScE5XZU9nEAE,A truly amazing modern take on Japanese cuisine. Every dishes we've had were creative and delicious. And all their cakes.. are to die for. One of the more interesting dining experience I've had in Melbourne without any of the pretentious feel. Amazing and warm experience. Looking forward to the next visit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEx1UVJBEAE,Worst experience I've had. There was no service at all. We sent our order through the phone at 2pm and you know what? It took half an hour for 2 drinks and exactly 1 hour for the food! Which is really ridiculous as the food was so average and they were not busy at all. Thanks for letting me know there was still a place like this exists
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ1BfN253RRAB,"Such a cute little spot , food was amazing , will be going back :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OVBITUxBEAE,different test to eat chicken
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUtzZhAB,"Absolutely trash place to eat, the waitress doesn't speak English because she didn't even understand the word ""Fries"". By the way, she really needs to fix her attitude for this business."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScS03NVZnEAE,"Hello management , i buy 2 Korean corndog last night but when I get home both of them is look like this ?????? What happend ???? Did u Reckon I buy this using paper ??? Not money ?????? I‚Äôm so dispointed with this . I know you wanna close , but you guys still in operating hours ! And if dont wanna sell them why you sell them ????? It‚Äôs look so disgusting ü§ß"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGJDTGV3EAE,"I paid 40 bucks for the boneless meat and ordered half. sheep is this right? Can't even half a lamb anywhere else??? One piece is about half the size of other places, and it's a waste of money even if you pay 20 bucks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ19malZnEAE,I love my Korean Fried chicken and this was very average.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1pidklnEAE,Our chips never came so we just had to leave without them after being there for an hour with our chicken
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWFfcGF3EAE,The best Korean chicken you could ever try!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVlYWkdnEAE,"Cold food,  staff who couldn't care less.  Might have just been having a bad day, but get the feeling this was not the case."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUpfc2NREAE,Very bad customer service and food. After I paid for the meal they told that particular meal is not available. The kimchi burger I bought was not fresh. Disgusting.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDczQ3JBRRAB,"Nice place for a quick bite to eat. Chicken was delicious. Rice, coleslaw and bulgogi sauce were really good too"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUltSVlnEAE,Waited 25mins for a chicken burger and i ended up with an undercooked chicken. No expert on burgers but not hard to see a raw chicken
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeUludFBBEAE,"We come last few days 9:30pm to have meal, find a seat after ordering, this lady waitress is in a hurry to get off work. We were going find table to sit, and she said loudly and impolitely that the table could not be sit. She told us politely without a smile, but said to us with sharp eyes and loud and rude attitude. When we finished eating and planned to go back to see if there was a toilet or a place where we could wash our hands, she looked at us rudely and loudly and stared at us and told us that there was no toilet and we didn't need to go in. I know you guys are going to be off work soon, and you are very dissatisfied with the customers who came in to eat at 9:30, but I feel like I offended her. She treated us with a rude attitude and dissatisfied eyes from the time we came in to eat until the end. We pay money to come to this store and be treated rudely. Waiter attitude sucks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNDlyVHNnRRAB,"Quick service , you can order from mobile or kiosks as well"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWU2Z2JnEAE,"The staff was sooooo rude!!!!!!!!!!! We were ready to order and she was busy to prepare food, so we were waiting. Two customer came and says ready to order, she asked me and my friend to queue after those two customers. DONT understand at all!!!!!!!! There are couple of free tables but the staff says only can do takeaway, it was 9pm and the shops closes on 10pm. When we were waiting for the food, the customer who came after us can dine in!!!! Very interesting policy for usüò†"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMGZIZEhREAE,"We were served by the Vietnamese girl, she offered us the Wednesday feast which was very great deal for us 3 people. The chicken was very yummy. Friendly staffs and good service, will come back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa2M2NjB3RRAB,"Absolutely terrible service. Waited 30 minutes for a simple burger combo, lady at the counter messed up the order numbers, and the chips weren't fresh despite her blaming the delay on having to make a fresh batch. Pathetic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N05QRzVRRRAB,"Service is good but saw two mice running around, not a place I would recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWVLUlZREAE,"Went for the first seating with a few friends. This is my second time here. Let me start with what I liked: The service is great! The food came quickly, ordering was smooth and pretty fast. Our request for extra dishes was also quickly delivered. All the wait staff were friendly and approachable.  The atmosphere is quite nice and warm. The ambiance is simple, they're not trying to do anything aesthetically outstanding - it's a chill restaurant. What I liked is the space was well lit (not doing that strangely dim or overly bright look) and it isn't very loud, so you can actually hear your friends talk - love that for a dinner catch-up.  Now, the not so good parts. Honestly I would give the food a 2/2.5, but that seems a bit harsh for how much meat they served up. The portions are good, definitely filling, so that's a plus, but the flavours were not a hit across the board. Some dishes were delicious, others left much to be desired. There wasn't much consistency with the seasoning or tenderness. Sometimes you'd get a rump steak that's beautifully seasoned and perfectly cooked, then you order more because you're keen and get something that's too salty and under-cooked. Also, as someone who loves grilled corn or any corn for that matter, their grilled corn was legit too sour, I do not know what they put on it, but most of us did not enjoy the corn. Such a shame, because like I said I LOVE CORN and could've eaten many cobs, if it was actually tasty. Can you tell I'm sad about it? I really was... Who messes up corn?! The sides were alright though, especially the fried banana yum!  The last time I came a few years ago, the meat was more consistently seasoned and cooked and I would've rated it a 4/5.  That said, I think it's just a matter of consistency. Quantity is not everything unfortunately and for that price, I think many people will want good quality across the range of meats.  I might try one more time, maybe."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aU51RUpBEAE,"I have been here twice and I can recommend B‚ÄôChurrasco for the meat lovers. It is a really good place to taste different type of meat. Make sure to be ready to eat all you can eat meat. I‚Äôll definitely come back. I didn‚Äôt attached any photos because was too busy eat, sorry!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b05PZS1nRRAB,"Food is delicious, 10 out of 10 Thanks"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzdDR0t3EAE,"Staff are Absolutely friendly 5 stars to them, but unfortunately we saw little mice running around behind our tables üò¨üò¨ ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTRuOWNBEAE,Wide range of tasty meat and great service ! üáßüá∑ üíö
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScS02Q09REAE,"Have been coming here since 2015. Always a good feed here.  Service is great.  Great for group bookings, work dinners or bdays.  It won't disappoint.  Picanha is my favourite"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczhqT3J3RRAB,Good good good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamNyY0RREAE,"The place is overrated, the service it's nor well studied they arrive in the beginning all in bulk not giving you time to enjoy and chill after you can claim another slice of the meat that you prefer which actually didn't arrive, The food it's really a low quality you go for eat meat but they give you mostly rice, potato and other cheap filling food which are not even good, the meat as well it comes cold at the table and the cut are cheap which I wouldn't aspected considering it's not all you can eat as they say because you get to eat probably 200 g of meat overall and the price it's insane for what you get, I suggest to reduce the staff and increase the quality. I would been happier eating a kebab"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGRuMnJnRRAB,"""$75 per person, this is going to be good!"", or so we thought. The concept of skewered meat being walked around and carved onto your plate made me assume we were going to be served piping hot and juicy freshly cooked meat. Instead we got warm, dry and bland meat. There was 2 out of more than 10 options that were average, everything else was below average. 1 of which, I had to spit out because of how dry it was.  The rate of service is considerably slow and confusing and obviously a business strategy to stop you from eating as much as you want/can.  If you're looking for a social night out, this could be fun. If you're looking for good quality food that is worth what you're paying, then steer clear of B'Churrasco."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenRxZU9nEAE,"‚ÄúAll you can eat‚Äù is a joke! Maybe ‚Äúbbq meat tasting‚Äù right name of this restaurant, and should highlight it in their menu so people not over optimistic. All you have is few slicers of meat first 20min, then hopping they give you more but just hope! For $70/head is scam !!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHJIRmRBEAE,Highly recommend. Such a nice experience to share with friends. The bbq experience is great. You have a light to tell them when to keep bringing meat and when to stop. The sides were tasty. Best rated dish was the cinnamon pineapple. Loved it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXI2TFVREAE,"If you like meat, this place incredible! Staff were so friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3BmM3VnRRAB,The staff was pretty rude and the food didn't taste fresh.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3IzOThBRRAB,"My go-to Churrasco in Melbourne. The staff are incredibly welcoming, the drinks, BBQ and dessert are incredible and it's endless! The ideal all you can eat experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3JuYTRBRRAB,"While the food quality and taste at this restaurant in the CBD were above average and the prices were reasonable, I was disappointed to be charged a no-show fee of $20. We had made a reservation for five but unfortunately, one person couldn't make it. Despite us still showing up with four people on a weekday when the restaurant was only half full, we were charged the additional fee. As such, I would advise against making a reservation and recommend walking in to avoid any unexpected charges."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEo2djRRRRAB,Amazing food!!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEpMQ0ZnEAE,So much food and worth it. Staff were great.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3ZDOTBBRRAB,Disappointed to say the least. Should have never gone to their F1 food truck. Worst meat ever
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmVTdnpRRRAB,Went there tonight for dinner and we were amazed by the excellent service and yummy food. We will definitely be back!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN1lQdkZREAE,Fantastic food and dining experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NU1HQU9BEAE,Worst experience the tall guy was high attitude not respecting customer he was criticising me when I was eating finally the way he treating the customers is not good I have observed him a lot this was not cool wrong way to treat the customer
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUw3Q0hBEAE,The tall guy Have very short temper and he won't respect everyone Showing attitude towards the customer He should respect customer definitely there is no point to dis-respect them Worst service please provide some good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NlBpSzR3RRAB,"The same price has a great advantage, and the super stunner can basically eat enough, killing the McDonald's and K Ji next door."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDZUQkZREAE,"Toilets filthy, nobody cleaning  tables, and didn't like the burger."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanBmcFNnEAE,"I had an absolutely delightful experience at Hungry Jack's today! While I was waiting for my order, I noticed that my order number was not shown on the screen and it had been a while (which is weird). To my surprise, the staff kindly upgraded my meal as a gesture of goodwill and compensation. Their generosity and excellent customer service truly made my day. ü•∞ü•∞"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFAzYVRnEAE,Nicole and orlando are aces at there job and made me and my pregnant partner feel very comfortable and listened to what we had to say they are very valuable workers and should looked into for a promotion i was not going to consider coming back to this store after having a outrageously rude encounter with a manager from the store but after seeing there are people there that genuinely care about the customers and the service they provide i am more then happy to come back  I cant find words to describe how much they just made my day‚Ä¶.  THANK YOU ORLANDO AND NICOLE!!!!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd09HM2dRRRAB,"Never met a whopper I didn‚Äôt like til here, place is filthy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ0pUMDBBRRAB,Very bad experience The floor staff was rude Especially name chandan If I am right I will give a 0 star for service for this restaurant Never had this kind of experience with hungry jacks before.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScy1uSXNRRRAB,"Dirty, very ordinary food. Toilets were exceptional in that they were completely filthy. They do not deserve to remain open."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NU9tSzJBRRAB,"The dry noodles were well cooked and the sauce was delicious. No complaints here, would recommend if youre hungry"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUp6ajZnRRAB,"The restaurant is very accessible, just within Melbourne City near tram station which about 1-2 minute walk. They have 2 floors with very spacious 2nd level. We ordered 2 noodles and both were full of flavours with warm broth and the noodles are firm and quite chewy. I love that they have chilli powder specially for someone like me who likes it spicy. Apart from noodles, we also ordered lamb skewers which were cooked perfectly, very tender and tasty (not salty)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzVHaldBEAE,"As a huge fan of noodles, I have explored many noodles places in Melbourne, in CBD particularly. I had Spicy beef noodles (thinner) and it was nice. Of course, there are few other places who offer better, but the price factor and efficiency of the staff makes up for whatever lacking. Recommended, overall, mainly for quick eats on cold winter days :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWFyMWJBEAE,The Lanzhou experience had me breathtaking. The noodles that were hand made were crafted to perfection. Absolutely exquisite!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenM2bldnEAE,Very nice and flavoursome noodles. Nice to be able to customise the dish. Lucky it is relatively cheap as the self service and the space leave much to be desired.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXRTR0J3EAE,"Really delicious and great poetion sizes. Definitely bang for your buck which can be hard to find these days. Noodles were perfectly done, nice and chewy, beef was very tender and the broth was flavourful yet not too salty. Would definitely recommend for a no fuss meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnZTUERBEAE,"The beef noodle soup is delicious in Melbourne, the meat is really tender, the portions are large, one portion is enough for two to eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXBiTUR3EAE,What a master!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeE9xb3VRRRAB,Great noodles. Great atmosphere. Service was very quick.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTV2bk5REAE,Will come back agon
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTZ2QnV3RRAB,like very much
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNlptemV3EAE,Literally addicted. Tried a combination of everything they offer.  Braised beef soup noodles and thick (3mm) is the best combination. More radish more leek less oil less salt.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWRubzZ3RRAB,"I have been waiting for 20 min , Staff ask to scan order and walk back to kitchen , but machine not working  not even to come to ask customer in restaurant have only 3 table"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnMyQnFBRRAB,"WOW.. I spend allot of time eating beef noodz, specially Lanzhou style, defs my favourite.  This place is so good, hand made noodles were amazing, beef was so, so good and the broth was equally as good.  I have my favourite in Sydney that‚Äôs for sure, but this is without a doubt my new favourite close second, I will be here every time I‚Äôm in Melbourne"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNkk2d3hBRRAB,The noodle and beef is great and friendly staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ09ha1pBEAE,"Delicious and fast turnaround, motorcycle parking out the front. Will be back for more tasty noodles"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDVtRE9REAE,This place is delicious. They are very quick and affordable. Noodles are made fresh.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlM3BLLW53RRAB,"The food was good, the noodles was great, the portions is just enough, at least they are generous with the meat.  The food was delivered to us quickly.  Don‚Äôt go there for customer service because is none, not a word was given to us the entire time we stay there. You order to the machine, you have to take your drinks.  Minus point they only provide plastic cutlery, not very convenient to eat the noodles, the tap water is hidden at the back FYI."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN2VfcHJBRRAB,Great place & good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWVQZ05REAE,It was a nice place with fast service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdktxOWtRRRAB,"üëçüèªüî•  Delicious dry hotpot in an easy to miss location on A'Beckett Street.  üçùüçÑ  With a decent collection of meat, seafood, vegggies, etc., the star of the show is the way they're cooked, i.e. the hotpot. A minimum of 375 g is required (~minimum of $15). I selected some skewered beef, chicken with broccoli, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms, prawns, quail eggs and glass noodles and paid $11.90 via EatClub for a total of $13. I loved the food, which I asked to ve made super spicy üå∂üå∂üå∂üå∂üî•. It was perfect. They've some √† la carte menu as well, that you can request for as well. A second lunch soon followed!  Do try their √† la carte menu. I had the Lamb Rice Spicy Pot ($14.10) and it was good!  The Kung Pao Chicken on Rice ($15.80) is a must try! It was great!  üßºüåÖ  The decorum of the restaurant is lovely, no loud music makes for a relaxing experience too.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNDUtbzlRRRAB,Walked all the way here 90 mins before closing only to be turned away because they didn‚Äôt have enough food and was understaffed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoanB6UHdnRRAB,The service staff is plain rude and unprofessional. They don't speak english well. The food is inconsistent everytime you order. I'll skip this venue for sure.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMi1HazJBRRAB,good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcFptb0RBEAE,"Ordered for a pick up via an app, arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food as the app said it was ready. They didn‚Äôt have my food & worst.. the staff could not speak & didn‚Äôt understand English. Will never order & step my foot inside this restaurant ever again! You are in Melbourne, hire someone that can speak English!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcVBEeFB3EAE,Treat the food with care. Very delicious too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcUlDMGd3RRAB,Overall very good but I can‚Äôt speak Chinese
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bS1uLW9RRRAB,"We had the whole store to ourselves and it was really good! I‚Äôd get the spiciest one next time but towards the end it got a little bit too oily. Other than that, the cheese tofu was amazing and everything else was yumz!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M2VMTmJREAE,The food is amazing! It's all perfectly cooked and flavoured and even cut into smaller pieces which makes it easier to eat! The medium has a good kick to it. The food really exceeded my expectations - I will 110% be coming back. The server was also super friendly and helpful. I highly highly recommend
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOFlTSHZBRRAB,What an amazing place for stir fried hot pot. Pick your own ingredients and flavour. We tried their house made cumin with a bit of spicy and it was so aromatic and just the right spice. The skewers had a slight sweetness to it and paired with some rice was perfect. Their salt and pepper tofu was a generous serving and lightly fried
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOGVidmVREAE,"A really delightful and delicious experience. We came here for lunch and really love it! I would absolutely recommend going here, I can't wait to go back myself!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnM3LXl3RRAB,"This is the best incense pot I've ever eaten. The service in the store is very good, the ingredients are fresh and the taste is very authentic. With such a high price/performance ratio, I don't know why this store is not popular."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnJhSDdBRRAB,very verytasty foodÔºåquickly served. A little bit   spicy for me. I  recommends mild.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTcU1pcmVnEAE,I really enjoy the meals I've had here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURja0szcDJRRRAB,Best dry hotpot in town! Recently renovated! Nice refit! Food is tasty as always!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eUpMNktnEAE,"üî•üçñ  Finally a Korean restaurant that won't break your bank! Kidding, this is a cute place on A'Beckett Street and you'll easily pass by and miss it, so be aware.  üçùüçö  Lovely food, lovely people and lovely place.I ordered a bowl of spicy ramen ($13). It was spicy and tasted fine. Served in a stainless steel bowl, I was happily surprised. The noodles themselves felt quite generic, like the store-bought ones. The soup was really hot and üå∂, and definitely made everything better. Another time, I and my friend ordered Spicy Chicken Giblets ($19) and 2 bowls of rice ($3.50 ea). The rice was in less quantity, but sufficed. The giblets were cooked very well.  üè§üë©‚Äçüç≥  I was planning on eating somewhere but thought to give this place a try. Glad that I did. This place has some cool animal sculptures on the wall and some watercolour-like artwork on the walls. Great staff, comfortable decor and pleasing vibes!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eUtPMzlBRRAB,I like Korean cold noodles here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdi12VUtBEAE,Ordered takeaway of jamppong and fried chicken. Both are very nice and recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeHVIOE1BEAE,"Been here few times.  Today I am here along. I order three dishes. At beginning they grab me some side dishes. But I was asking why other table have kimchi I didn‚Äôt.  After they bring to me ! Ha. Feel so sad !  Not after free side dish.  Just been treated different feel so bed , even I order more then other tables."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNUstUllREAE,Food was good. Nice atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocnRPbzh3RRAB,"Me and my friend decided to come to Darac cause it just few foot steps away from my house. We ordered Ox Tongue, Fried Chicken Wings and Jajangmyeon for dine in. I must say the Fried Chicken Wings was my favourite. The Ox Tongue was so soft and flavour of Jajangmyeon could not go wrong, absolutely delicious. I wanted to order more because the Galbi and Army Stew look super tempted, but I will save it for next time when I bring more friends here. And we also have 2 cocktails, which was Yakult Soju and something‚Ä¶Frog (made with midori). Both of us ended up getting stuffed and incredibly happy about the dinner. Highly recommend Darac !!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bU5HbUxREAE,Nice food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbzVhVDFBRRAB,Waited my takeaway meal for 15 minutes in a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù restaurant. Also the countertop is spill with soft drink and make my packet wet.  The popcorn chicken are over salted.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemJqWnFRRRAB,This is the best KFC in Melbourne CBD. It's cleaner and better decorated. Food is prepared quickly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodnBiUlRnEAE,There‚Äôs always something missing from my meal and staff give mad attitude
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXJTZ0x3EAE,Always üëè check üëè your üëè ORDER üëè Don't leave the store until you check what's in your bag because it's almost always missing something or just completely wrong. It's happened to me several times and I didn't realise until I got home.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXZxenNnRRAB,Regular KFC. Service is pretty fast even on a rush hours.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3AtQV9RRRAB,Quick and service was fantastic
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdk5hd093EAE,"üëçüèªüôÇ  Being a street corner store is no easy thing, but this place is quite well managed, although the service can be a tad slow at times.  üçóüçü  It's KFC after all! The quality has been always very consistent and at budget prices has been a lifesaver a bunch of times. The Ziger Twister I ordered ($13) was good with the curry and soft drink complimenting it.  üßëüèæ‚Äçüç≥ü§†  Kudos to the amazing staff!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2ViX3l3RRAB,just choose it from the machine than wait
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOHNxdjNBRRAB,Oily and flavorles chicken as any other KFC in Melbourne.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHRTT0JREAE,was delicious! The method of frying fried chicken is different from Japan. The clothes are crisp and delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodF9Lc2pBRRAB,Perfect
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocThfQTVRRRAB,Was served by a lovely fellow named Jaquavius. He had a bright smile and made my day. Food was absolutely disgusting but the food was served nice and lukewarm before I splurged my load allover the fries. Chicken was raw but that‚Äôs how i Like it cos imma raw dogga 4 life. Definitely NOT gonna visit again that shi was dawg food bru üò≠
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGNHYnhRRRAB,"Nice staff, however after sitting outside with my food, a girl in the KFC uniform next to me was talking about how she didn't care that she was slacking off during work. I don't know if the staff are properly monitored or if that was just her break so I'm not too disappointed. Also paid for extra salt on my chips but some parts didn't have as much salt as others. Overall, not bad, just better places to go since there's so many restaurants and stores around."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWZuZDZRRRAB,"Went to dine in, first off service was rude, in me and my friends boxes, the popcorn chicken was half full, chicken on burgers was completely over done and dry, the bread on the burger was completely stale, the chips were over cooked and made us feel extremely sick. Would definitely not recommend this kfc whatsoever, completely disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodWZ6OW9BRRAB,Filthy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmN2Y29nRRAB,Ordered 2 go buckets. One was correct.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4X095bGNREAE,As soon as we stepped in we received great customer service from someone called Deb :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4alBHazVRRRAB,"Best part of our trip, spectacular service from Deb ! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU9MM1lBEAE,New to Melbourne and a little flight tired and hungry. We just had to try the pancake parlour. What can I say the food is incredible just as is the service. Our waitress was very attentive welcoming and friendly! She was really sweet we didn‚Äôt catch her name but she had an American accent. We opted to order with our table waitress. Far better experience than using the QR app.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE9tVGpnRRAB,"If your in Melbourne  I definitely recommend  a visit here. The pancakes are out of this world. You can choose  between sweet or savoury, the atmosphere is so good we rocked up at 9.30pm on a Friday night and it was quite busy. The staff are friendly and give great service. Will be going back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MklYNVBREAE,"Delicious authentic pancakes. A few types to choose and the Marple Syrup is amazing!! The price is a bit high, but worth try at least once."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cVBMOEFREAE,"Everytime I come to Melbourne, Pancake Parlour is a definite stop on my itinerary. This time was no exception, our waiter was friendly, made helpful suggestions and the food ü§å amazing. Not a fault."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEt2Z1J3EAE,Good food reasonable prices large meals
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NE96aXF3RRAB,"Debs friendly service was amazing, she is very kind!! she helped us pick out the best meal options and even persuaded us to try the new steak that is on trial, which was delicious, so i‚Äôm glad she recommended it! definitely would come here again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWU3QzFnRRAB,"Chahat is incredible at her job. Give her a promotion or something, she's lovely and made my day"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjlMOGFREAE,"Been a while. Cheese and Potato Pancake with buttermilk butter and salad. The cheese topping was overcooked to a crisp, rather than a chewy niceness. I asked them to reconsider the salad and revert to the previous, most delicious version, of finely shredded cabbage with a light vinaigrette dressing and the radish, celery and cherry tomatoes. Pancake sizes are getting smaller. For dessert, chose the Mini Pancakes, 2stack Bavarian Apple and cream. Delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTdDZHJ3RRAB,"Soft and fluffy pancakes, very modern and spacious venue , friendly , fast and responsive staff ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDcyTUl3EAE,Good service . Friendly and very kind. Deb was amazing loved her service and the care she provided for our table !!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDlXZ1pREAE,Lovely staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMV9lWnVnRRAB,"The staff member that was serving us was fantastic, she assisted us with what to order.  The Pancakes were delicious but at the parlour the Pancakes are generally expensive, I just wish it was cheaper as it's just pancakes with fruit and ice cream being served."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjlUNU9REAE,"Such a lovely staff, very welcoming and made me feel safe. Would 100% recommend eating here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjlUMm1BRRAB,"Amazing workers, constantly asking if we are okay. Constantly kind. The food was amazing, would 100% come back just for the staff. Super welcoming place. Thank you to the staff. I highly recommend all people to come here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjVUOXZ3RRAB,Hospitality was absolutely amazing!!! Thank you to all the staff <3 will 100% be coming back xxx
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTluSDJBRRAB,It was my first time eating here and we had the best experience. The food was amazing and the staff were so helpful when it come any queries we had! Would 100% recommend. Super cute place for a good catch up with friends/ date!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTRuTjZ3RRAB,These were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. If you ever come to Melbourne you have to come here and get the pancakes with an iced coffee. I would fly back just for the pancakes ü•û
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBcmJMa0l3EAE,"A great location in Melbourne Central and a really nice and comfortable space. The service has been consistently good too (based on several visits spanning many years), but the food isn't the best value.  2023 UPDATE: Adding an extra star for their amazing birthday offer! Well played, Pancake Parlour"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa19YUEtREAE,"I had a great time at Pancake Parlour! I had the short stack with ice cream, and they were delicious. Our waitress Deb provided excellent service throughout our meal. The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and vintage decor. Highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdzhyejFRRRAB,House made lemonade is the best lemonade I've tasted. Short stack is absolute heaven HIGHLY recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWFuQ1d3EAE,"Fantastic service, my partner has Coeliac disease and is extremely sensitive to gluten and cannot handle even a crumb! Our server Ken was incredible! Answered all our questions, spoke with kitchen staff and provided organic maple syrup on the house to accomodate his dietary requirements! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGJPUTRnRRAB,Awesome as always. Yammy pancakes üòç and excellent customer service ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocXZXV3B3RRAB,"Spent my 50th there, staff were so friendly,  food delicious and such a great ambience. Great central location too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3JEM3VBRRAB,"One of the best sit-down meals I‚Äôve ever had. Beautiful ambiance and interior with dim lighting/lamps & the wait staff were very easy going and attentive. Had a cocktail to start the dinner with my partner which was very tasty. Starters were delicious meatballs and focaccia, and as we went on a Wednesday it was gnocchi night. Had a pork and fennel sausage gnocchi dish which was literally perfect tasting with chilli and broccoli mixed in the dish. Gnocchi soft as butter and olive oil running through the plate showed authentic Italian taste. Absolutely amazing dinner 10/10 will definitely come back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdlBXdzl3RRAB,"Looked for cozy restaurant, got cozy restaurant.  If you want a nice place to have a chat with friends and have some delicious food then this is it. Got the swordfish, the two pasta specials, some drinks, and dessert, all were great. The waiters were attentive too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbE1iZzRBRRAB,It's good but the portions are small
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk1pTnF3RRAB,"Handmade pasta, great service, cosy atmosphere‚Ä¶ nothing to fault :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOWVDdFJBEAE,"Amazing food. Went out with 12 people and had to take up set menu, but the food and service was amazing!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGJpelZREAE,Very nice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXBXWVFREAE,"The staff here are incredible - even during their busiest time, they were the friendliest and most accommodating people! I would give their service 10 stars if I could. Food, drinks and atmosphere equally great. Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScUxxOTVnRRAB,"'Probably the best gnocchi I've ever eaten' said my friend. Really an amazing place with incredible staff. The food is so good, check the new mussle dish. Come for the golden happy hours from 4 till 6 drinks and stay for dinner. I would recommend for a hinge date to. üòâ. Go try the Moat they will not dissapoint, comfort, class, service and food. (Drinks)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSME42VHFRRRAB,"OMG, the aroma of garlic, chilli and rosemary from the kitchen left my mouth watering as soon as I walked in. Our party of six couldn't fault our dining experience. The service was attentive and polite. They couldn't have been more helpful with advice on dish selection and accompanying wines. Being vegan, they made me a separate dish that wasn't on the menu working with what is in season, so all vegans pay attention! I have to say it was so wholesome and fresh, absolutely delicious. Love the atmosphere and location. I would highly recommend it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2ZmV1d3EAE,Thus place is great. It's the best Italian food I have had outside of Italy.  Friendly service and reasonably priced considering the great quality. It would make a great location for a romantic winter date.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamNhZlB3EAE,"Had a great night on Valentines Day. Service was excellent and the food was creative, presented well and tasty. The owner came out to great us and was also very friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOVkzSHd3RRAB,Had dinner here with a group of friends.. Ordered their special - truffles pasta along with king prawns pasta. Truffles pasta was a disappointment.. hardly any taste of truffles and was bland. King prawns pasta was delicious though. Service was slow.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobGRIWFN3EAE,Truffle pasta. Underwhelming.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNk9PVE93EAE,"I had their special, a lamb gnocchi, the only issue I have with it is that it's not on the main menu! So delicious"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNk0yU1BREAE,I love this place. Great pasta and comfort food. Wine list is perfect and the staff are always lovely. A favourite üòä
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOXFlOWtBRRAB,"Great place for a casual weekday dinner. Friendly fast service, nice food, good drinks options."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteDhEdzNBRRAB,"Great atmosphere, food and customer service. A nice place to go to with friends, family or in-laws."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN3ZXWDNnRRAB,Wonderful Perfect acoustics for talking to friends.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcnFfSjhRRRAB,I loved
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbE4tZFhBEAE,"Amazing service, delicious food, cosy and ambient. Great be hundred percent recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaWE2VVN3EAE,Rosie and Paul have provided an amazing catering service for our event at the Wheeler Centre. The booking and communication was seamless. The service and timing was amazing. And the food was just fantastic - very yummy and so well presented and managed.  We had less guests than anticipated and to avoid the wastage of food they even managed organising food donation on our behalf. Highly recommend it for your future events.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtanZtX0dBEAE,"Happy hour drinks tasted watered down, which is a shame. Regardless the happy hour prices were awesome and its a bit of a hidden gem right in the CBD.  Would be great on a warm summer day!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNnZDenpnRRAB,"Amazing food, friendly service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMUkzbVpREAE,"Lovley little find. We arrived without booking and luckily we managed to get a table. The staff are terrific and will explain menu and give advice on dishes. The food was amazing and good portion sizes, they don't rush courses which is good great ambience and relaxing atmosphere definitely highly recommend and not over priced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMFBQLU9REAE,"Fabulous quirky venue, a favourite for ambience, food and great service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aVA2dFNBEAE,"Came here for lunch, the portion was quite generous but its tasted just ok and does not taste like Japanese food. Customer service was quick and friendly. The ambiance was so small."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTlMNGN3EAE,Nice üëçüèæ! ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHBMeFVnEAE,"Been coming here for too many years, the place is too busy and always no seating, but this restaurant has a very special place in my heart. Service was never good, but the food is good and quick, and that‚Äôs enough for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTZpTVJREAE,"Quite generous portion for the price paid.  Too small and limited seatings.  At times, can be tight inside when busy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjdlakhnEAE,10/10 katsu dons Seating is limited but this is a true hole in the wall place that‚Äôs does amazing food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTZIeDJBRRAB,Nice ramen
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGNTcUFREAE,"I don‚Äôt know what to give me when I buy a beef tongue rice, it affects my appetite"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeFlCUhAB,"Had a beef oyako-don here the other night and it was excellent. Well-cooked, good mix of vegetable, egg & meat, not too sweet or salty, good portion.  I have not had noodles or udon here before, but their rice dishes suches as oyako-don, katsu-don, etc, have turned out great every time.  Only issue is the small space, and service is not bad but could be better. Last time I was dining in but was given a takeaway bag."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXZUWTJRRRAB,"It can only be said that the quality of the waiters is very low. Not only did they deliver the wrong meal, but the customers who ordered behind me have almost finished their food, and they never served it to me, and they did not apologize at all. This restaurant is very rude"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoakpuX1BnEAE,"Ordered a tempura udon. It‚Äôs clear that the udon quality is pretty poor. The udon noodle is supposed to be chewy, but their udon is soft. The tempura stuffs are not ideal either, tempura prawn crust is hard instead of crunchy. Overall taste and experience is bad, definitely will not come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNktuZ0l3EAE,"I rarely write bad reviews but I had to let this out. Me and my brother visited Menya for a quick lunch. First of all, bad service and attitude. Cheap lunch yes, but my udon was barely edible. Soup tasted like salty water, udon was sour I was really disappointed. Brother‚Äôs gyudon was literally piled with carrots. Really sad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNEs3NU53EAE,"By far the worst ""gyudon"" I've ever had in my life. Like who puts green peas and carrots in a gyudon? Plus it's super oily and tasteless. If i could rate it 0 stars i would!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoellmdlhREAE,Best gyutandon!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMVBMVW53RRAB,Amazing taste! Generous serving! Not that big area but you wouldn't mind.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLUpxX3hBRRAB,Quite good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaDZTNFlREAE,rubbish
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd3FtNkNBEAE,"We got the curry katsudon and it was very nice, would recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa1l6NjBRRRAB,"Poor service, food is oily, not recommended, go somewhere else"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaEpiRTFRRRAB,YummyüòÄüòÄ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaF8zcnFBRRAB,"Ordered a portion of Gyu Tan Don and extra meat. The regular portion comes at $22 and $8 for extra meat. So after paying $30, the bowl that comes to the table had so little meat that i had to go up to the counter and confirmed if this had the extra $8 meat that i paid for. The staff brazenly said yes and went along her way.  Very ridiculous rip off compared to the other branch, this place has always been known to be stingy with its portion size but to think that they would openly do this to a $30 order is just ridiculous. Will never eat here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOWJhREV3EAE,"One of the worst restaurants I've ever tried. I'm not sure if the customer service it's worse than the food or viceversa, but what I know is that I had the worse experience ever. The food quality is very bad, barely eatable. The tonkatsu ramen tastes of nothing, worse than instant noodles, I can't even understand how this place can be popular. It tastes disgusting, it's a torture to eat. The Asian lady today (06/12) was extremely rude, no manners at all when taking my order, she seems so frustrated and unwilling to work. I don't require much, but seriously it seems like she was making me a favor for ordering. After ordering she just literally point out a place to sit (with no manners) where all the bowls from previous customers were still there and the table was dirty and she didn't even bother to clean a bit. Think about to sit down and waiting for your food with the dirty dishes in front of you on the table. AVOID THIS PLACE."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLXM2YUdBEAE,"For a cheap price, you can get very full. This restaurant give you the best offers for your amount of money. The food also taste very authentic and delicious. Remember to wait for it to cool down a bit since they serve it fresh out of the pan."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc3F6ZW5RRRAB,"We usually go for the gyudon which is still very tasty but like many other things, the price has gone up significantly!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ09hYU1REAE,"This place is definitely 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è for me A nice cozy Japanese eatery in Melbourne central near the swanston entrance.  What I had today was chicken Katsu don. Let‚Äôs break it down  Rice Often forgotten part of a rice bowl, the most important of them all. Rice was cooked well and not sticky.  Omelette Omg, this was out of the world, so fluffy and soft  Chicken, a bit dry and a bit thin but perfect for a weekday lunch, no complaints. It was nice and crispy  Will be back for more"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtamZxd093EAE,"At 4:30 p.m. on November 10th, there was a pot-covered male clerk who was invincible and confused. A single girl occupied a table for four. The clerk didn't let the table match. The table has never asked me why I still watch people take the dishes this time? Is it because my sister is single?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHJxSHV3RRAB,Great food and service Thanks
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWN1aWlBRRAB,RMIT's good meeting spot to talk

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoZ28zQi1BRRAB,"Coffee was reasonably good but flavour wasnt as good as I'd expect. It's a good spot for some lunch while at RMIT, I'd come back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeWQzbkhBEAE,Just wasted 11.50$ on lukewarm coffee and a burnt toastie - they need to actually care about what they do because it‚Äôs not worth the money
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDhMa3R3RRAB,"Quick, no frills cafe located on the RMIT campus. Friendly service and decent breakfast. Toast, fried eggs, and a flat white were prepared well and quickly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcTQ3UkdREAE,"Located within the RMIT city campus, nice staff and good food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb3JEVERREAE,The Francis Ormond Building was originally a Working Men College in 1881 before it was converted to RMIT.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTVlN3dnRRAB,Bad service from the cashier
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTVlZ1RnEAE,Rude lady at cashier
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScS1mZU5BEAE,I came some other day at afternoon time and the man working at the counter was very helpful to me. He helped me picked food eventhough i can‚Äôt speak chinese.  However the lady working on 11 april at 11am at the cashier was rude and not accomadating to my family.  Poor service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaHBueHVBRRAB,"When you ordered take away, they charge extra for take away container!? That's ridiculous!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCXzd1azZnRRAB,Thank you for giving me bad feelings from the store clerk
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLWVLSnRBRRAB,Yummy Like üëç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdUx5RmpBRRAB,"As a native of Chongqing, this is the lightest dish I have ever eaten. I added three tablespoons of chili oil they put on the table and it was still very lightüòÖ Was another Tianfu noodle restaurant quite authentic before?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcDlTZWd3RRAB,The spicy soup noodles are mmm soo yummy üçú Service pretty good as always. It is the go-to place for a happy noodle meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCenJlLWJ3EAE,"Strange name for an otherwise unremarkable place. Anyway, I ordered The Fried Chicken Noodle Soup ($ 17.80). I was really underwhelmed by the dish. The soup itself was lacking flavour. Not bland, but very boring. The noodles were lackluster. The only saving grace were the fried chicken, which were done properly. I could be wrong if that's how Sichuan noodles are supposed to be but I didn't enjoy it very much. Another thing that really bothered me was the behaviour of the staff who took my order. She might have had a not-so-good day, but putting in cleaned chopsticks in the holders on the table while customers are still eating is straight up unprofessional, and bothersome. I couldn't find anything dainty about this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaHYteGtnRRAB,Had beef noodles. Decent. Not amazing.  Spring rolls large but also nothing special
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd3FmaGxnRRAB,"If sichuan is your thing, you really ought to try dainty"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdWZia25RRRAB,"I finished all. The food is very delicious and service is great as well. The cashier is quick and friendly, she helps the kitchen to bring out the food as quickly as possible during busy time, very professional. Definitely come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtM3UzZ0JREAE,"rude staff with the worst attitude I have ever seen in Mel restaurants, the staffs in Karen‚Äô Diner are even more approachable. Would give a big 0 if I can"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtc3ZEZUV3EAE,"I had dinner with friends on October 31st, and ordered braised fat sausages and bowls of miscellaneous dry distillation. First of all, the service attitude is very poor, especially a Chinese lady at the front desk (should be Malay) put on a stinky face, and then forgot to remind which bowl is less spicy when serving, and was very impatient, we were all very Ask politely and patiently. I think fast food noodle shops can not need service, but there is no need to show the customer's face. Secondly, the fat intestine is not clean, and diarrhea after eating. I ate very lightly that day, I didn't overeat, and I didn't have any ailments and problems with my stomach. The fat intestines are very fishy, ‚Äã‚Äãand the handling is very poor. If you eat the whole thing, you will feel nauseated. Secondly, I think the price of this restaurant is expensive among fast food noodle restaurants, and the noodles are not freshly pulled, but frozen or ready-made. I sincerely hope that the store can improve, because QV's Tianfu Noodles used to be very popular. But I don't recommend everyone to eat"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbTRiOHR3RRAB,"Delicious Food, customer service is not too bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMmRXcXRnRRAB,not bad but not authentic chongqing food. Dont recommend fried glutinous rice cakeÔºåoverly greasy and cloying
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleHB1bGx3RRAB,"Food is fine. But service is not, the middle-age lady is not professional."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOE9UWVlnEAE,"The sauerkraut is delicious, the meat is enough, and the soup is delicious"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ3NfaHJ3RRAB,"I went today for spicy noodles, the menu shows 3 chilli, the dish waant spicy at all, no spicy, i didnt like..... i was expecting that it was going to be spicy, i felt disappointed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c2EtNnNRRRAB,"The small noodles are numb but not spicy, and the fat intestines are clean. It's ok for a light lunch. 19.8 knives a piece. Cash checkout free of surcharge."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3VqRDBBRRAB,Pretty average
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNV8zY0tnEAE,"I ordered sour spicy beef potato noodle. The quality is excellent but it‚Äôs pricey compared to the amount of food. Another the down side is one of the staff was kinda impolite while I was eating. She told a group of people to sit on my table cos I was the only one sitting on the edge of the table. So far it‚Äôs fair enough. But later she told them in a loud voice that I will leave soon while I still had nearly half of the food in my bowl. If you don‚Äôt mind with the quality of the service, definitely come and try their excellent noodles."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMmNXNURREAE,I love all these dishes!!!! I‚Äôll definitely come back here!!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbXJYNDR3RRAB,"I am a regular customer, and his noodles are delicious, especially the spicy beef noodles, which I have eaten since the earliest old shop, and I still love it most. Cold noodles are also a must every time. The brown sugar glutinous rice cakes of his family are also very delicious, and they are not quite the same as others. I feel that the glutinous rice cakes in it are also sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXJUSTB3RRAB,"The best pan mien you can find in Melbourne. The soup is very tasty, not sure if it‚Äôs due to MSG."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdF9lRWRnEAE,"My go to for a quick, warm lunch. Light tasting broth but their chilli sauce has some serious kick üëå great noodles consistency.  Always leave me happy afterwards."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLS1xNWJnEAE,Authentic pan mee! Hard to find one close to my hometown but this shop serve pretty tasty pan mee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbFBQUDVRRRAB,"i order without ancovy, but my noodle got ancovy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd3ViZ0hREAE,"It‚Äôs so good and taste amazing. It‚Äôs taste the same as in Malaysia. Love the torn pan mee, it was my all time favourite and the portion may seem a little, but it will make you satisfied for sure. I wasn‚Äôt come here at the busy time , so get served pretty quick. But it‚Äôs worth the wait"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTZUMWFBEAE,Very authentic flavour. I tried the dry thick pan with fried pork and 3 colour drink. The taste made feel like what I ate in Sarah KK.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a3NQajFnRRAB,"No complains on noodles & curry. But, about the chicken üëé. I don‚Äôt think a noodle bow consisting of chicken skin, bones, & very little meat would be appetising. Sorry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OUxfSEZREAE,This Malaysian üá≤üáæ handmade noodles are delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dl92X2ZnEAE,"This is not authentic Malaysian Pan Mee. Firstly, the ‚Äúthick torn noodles‚Äù are so thick that they are exactly like the Northern Chinese Biangbiang noodles- not Malaysian pan mee. There are only a few tiny strands of veg- come on. Surely another strand of choi sum wouldn‚Äôt blow the business budget? The only redeeming factor is the added lard which gives the dish some taste. But it isn‚Äôt authentic Malaysian pan mee."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aXFEZDN3RRAB,Very good Pan Mee. I was very surprised. We didn't get the bad service that other reviewers had. Maybe we had a different lady at the counter or maybe she was in a good mood that morning that we were there. Will be back again next time we are in Melbourne!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcFBfSEl3EAE,Bad service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDltWlZnEAE,"Recommend to visit this joint whenever you crave an authentic Pan Mee. Their crispy pork Pan Mee is super delicious and well portioned; and, as good as where you'd find in Malaysia. Have it with their Ice Lemon Tea, the perfect match to cleanse the palate after having your savoury dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdm9UWlNBEAE,Yummy!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXamItN1RBEAE,"Really enjoyed the Lat Jiu Pan Meen. The extra wide noodles were silky when coated with the sauce, giving a nice balance of chilli and crunch. Will go again to try out more dishes abd the different types of noodles."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc3RDUnJnRRAB,The lady‚Äô service is so freaking bad.. are you supposed to be that rude to your customer? What a shame
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdXZhM09BEAE,Small selection of dishes but very tasty
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdXByTjJBRRAB,I was dissapointed with the service at the QV branch today. My order was skipped twice. 2 people received their order with the same food before me. I had to wait more 30 min.  I remind the staff after I saw someone who ordered after me received the same food. But it happened again. Trully dissapointed
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMV8zZWtnRRAB,Yummy Malaysian noodles. I actually love the chilli sauce that is served with it more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbDd6Wll3EAE,Went to the city on a Sunday after being away for 9 months. Things have obviously changed due to the pandemic. The QV food court was dead quiet but Jojo‚Äôs Little Kitchen was busy producing bowls of delicious pan mee. I had the chilli pan mee which was full of flavour. The egg with a runny yolk was amazing and mixing the whole dish was a fun exercise. I demolished it in record time and left feeling satisfied. Definitely worth a visit.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDVDUnFnRRAB,I happily drive 45 mins just to have their Chilli Pan Mee. It's that good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LU9QVTFnRRAB,"The oldies, open till late!  love the new site, clean! These are must order here üòè"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaHZ1R1BREAE,"We had a family gathering dinner there. We didn‚Äôt make a reservation but the staff said we could come in now but only be given 1.5hr to eat our dinner. It was about 5:45pm when we get there. We finished in time and left the restaurant. Sadly, we found out that actually no one was reserving our table like the staff said. There were 3 tables were cleaned including ours. So, I realised that the staff was lying about the reservation. I believes that he just want to keep the table empty for the next walk in customers to make more money. Secondly, , we were very disappointed with the food. We ordered a lobster (3 pounds), Peking duck (16 slices), hotpot tofu, beef sliced with veggies, Peking sauce pork, salt and paper chicken and 12 abalone (3 flavoured). All cost us about nearly $600. Peking duck was tough and worse taste ever. Beef slice was hard to chew too. Seafood Tofu wasn‚Äôt good either. Abalone wasn‚Äôt cleaned properly and was hard to eat too. Salt and Pepper chicken was poorly presented and you can see the uncooked powder around it. Everything was disappointing except for Peking sauce pork chops. Never go back again. The worse dinner ever and embarrassing to us as we invited our family from overseas to have a nice meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeklpa3BRRRAB,"Great for supper , authentic Cantonese cuisine"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMkpQcVdBEAE,Very busy when we went. Food was good however I left feeling hungry. Our banquet was a bit light on the servings. Pretty pricey for what we got.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeUl6NUV3EAE,"Great, late-night food in Melb. Buzzing, busy atmosphere which was perfect for drinking a few byo bottles of wine with friends before a late comedy show. Took the advice of the reviews and ordered the xo clams with Chinese doughnuts which were delicious. We also loved the chicken ribs. Would definitely recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMDdiSWlnRRAB,Nice place to have Chinese meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWZXeU9REAE,"THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT. HOWEVER, THEIR STAFF ARE THE RUDEST."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa09DUWJBEAE,"Worst restaurant I have ever been in my life. Staff are rude, especially that chinese lady staff who wear masks. Portion is small. Food is not bad but DEFINITELY NOT WORTH the price you are paying. DON'T EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T GIVE YOU GOOD SERVICES."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejVPTWZnEAE,Absolute poor quality and manners. Workers here have absolute no respect to the customers. Have no words to say. Everyone must pay at least $25 for their meal. Pay so much for such little portion and for such rude service. Absolute no! Do not come here!! Scam!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobDcyVjJBRRAB,The pork bun was really great. Worth to try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeTV6MjlBRRAB,"Been going here for 20 years and moved to Sydney. Recently came back to try the new location and was utterly appalled. We were the first people in the restaurant for the dinner sitting so there was absolutely no excuse for the poor food.  I stuck to their classics:  Salt and Pepper Chicken Ribs - Undercooked and where the oil was obviously not hot enough to make the batter crispy and was soggy with oil. Add onto that the fact the salt and pepper was totally bland with not enough five spice or garlic or SALT!  XO Pippis - what the hell happened here? The pippis, once their trademark dish have now become pathetically small and not live; definitely not the large plump ones of yesteryear. Not only that, there were broken shells all over the dish and was surprised I didn't chip my teeth.  The third dish was not even worth mentioning as it was so poorly cooked. As I said, absolutely no excuse and boils down to lazy bad  chefs when no one is in the restaurant and the food was cooked with  a care factor of zero!  I have told many many people to come here over the years and be sure to them all to avoid it as there are many suburban restaurants 10 times better than this place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaTh6LXBBRRAB,"There was an older looking waitress who wore a black service suit yesterday, kind racist, and looked at people with an uncomfortable look in her eyes. Won‚Äôt recommend this to anyone.  Never learned how to be nice to others. Rude and disrespectful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodmI2bWlnRRAB,The best!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc095NW9BRRAB,Best value Cantonese cuisine in Melbourne. Top 4/5 star restaurant chefs in Melbourne rave about its chilli pippis and pork belly just melts in your mouth! My overseas friends just can't get the same quality in Singapore and Malaysia. Keep up the good work Sherry!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaHRhOHR3RRAB,"The food was so so good. The xo pipis with chinese donuts was hands down the best. But everything else including the fried prawns, and steamed fish was just as amazing too. Definitely going back to try others. Good service too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N05yYnZBRRAB,"We have tried the combo rice from the hot bar and petai fried rice. Fried rice was good but the combo rice was pretty average, the fried chicken in particular is so dry and bland. Price is reasonable and the staff was friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEszdWtBRRAB,The lighting is so bright against the white on the wall needs to be toned a little
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dVBUTy1RRRAB,"First Indonesian restaurant i just visiting when got to Melbourne. Had nasi campur aka mix rice with yummy rendang , Indonesian fried chicken style , water spinach sauted with garlic and sambal. willo be back again for another take away food."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzZqZEJBEAE,They've moved from Swanston st to Lonsdale st (opposite QV/Westpac bank). It's slightly smaller than before but looks very bright. I couldn't really remember now but it feels like they have slightly less prepacked cakes/snacks selection.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajVMVFpREAE,Good food.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOC1qR3hRRRAB,"There are currently many much better options for Indonesian food than  Neleyan I must say.  This place has potential to be good but they need to fix a few things. First of all the food service from the Bain Marie is not hot enough in fact quite cold and was not enjoyable to eat. The beef randang had a good flavour, the chicken very bland 5/10 The satay skewer were nice but again quite cold in temp. 6/10 The avocado drink was the worst item I ordered, tasteless, not cold and with the mix of cheap chocolate sauce didn‚Äôt work for me 2/10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzUyQUNnEAE,First time trying Batagor (it‚Äôs like a fried fish cake dim sim served with peanut sauce) and I loved it!!!! Would also recommend trying their rendang (full of coconut aroma) and Klepon (something like a Pandan coconut mochi balls)!!! üòçüòçüòçüòç

On her birthday was a Good Friday us and our friend went hunting for a restaurant to celebrate, when we came across this Nelayan Restaurant.Ordered two types of fish and soup and my friend decided to order two choices on the bain marie a rice with  liver and kangkong (water spinach) as she was digging in on her meal half way she saw a big red rubber band which we taught was a chili but she confirmed it was a red rubber band.She was upset and called the waitress and showed her the rubber band. 1st the waitress apologies then offered a new plate but my friend was already not in the mood for dinner and advise the waitress to advised the chief to make sure that to check throughly before serving the food. A few minutes later the waitress cameback and gave $16.10 back. I had then returned the money back to the waitress and told her we have no intentions of making an issue our aim is to make sure that does not happen to others this is why we flagged it and before I returned to my table I said all good...You would THINK she would say THANK YOU NO she did not and even the chief I would thought that will come out and apolgies NO did NOT...I was not going to write this review but is it upsetting RIGHT.. Kindness it does exist but people dismiss it and ignored which is very SAD. Please remember this name NELAYAN...."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjdTVGp3RRAB,"The lady at the cashier seems like isn‚Äôt too fancy about her job. Wasn‚Äôt gonna make a big fuss as she wouldn‚Äôt be the first one in hospitality industry. She treated other customers with the same coldness too. Until a few of gentlemen came in, she greeted them with passion and served them nicely. Just felt sick after seeing the situation. The extra one star is for the lady who asked us politely before cleaning the table."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajhyNzVnRRAB,"I've been going to this restaurant since the first time I landed in Melbourne, but haven't been in for a while.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDZpUzVRRRAB,"This place has the best best tonkotsu ramen I have tried in Australia hands down! And I didn't even eat at the restaurant but ordered for delivery and the quality was still amazing. Every other ramen shop, popular or not, that I have had in Melb and Sydney there ramen is either too salty, too oily or too bland. The ramen here is perfect and it reminds me of the a really good ramen that I had in Tokyo a few years ago."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmR6eE13EAE,"Amazing, best ramen in town...."

I have watched so many good people contort themselves around to view this list from the right perspective, watching the shoulders tuck in like an Olympic diver and the hips slowly follow, the neck reaching out to purse at a name, pointing without an elbow, beak like, pecking at a name that no one else but the person who wrote it can read. Bring a coat"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWZMQmJ3EAE,Amazing place. Food was lovely saw some awful critters for customers there. But the workers were reasonable with the kind they were dealing with.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEkzUWdnRRAB,"tried both flinders and russell st outlet  broth was flavourful, portion was generous and pretty worth it for the price paid (10% off cash payment or there‚Äôs a liven promotion for card payment) flinders st provided 2 pc of thin pork slices which was slightly too over cooked and tough. russell st provided 1 pc of thicker pork slice and was much more tender and well cooked. the meat is a crucial part of ramen so i would return to russell st and skip flinders st outlet.  especially after the service staff at flinders st cleared away my ramen after i told her to leave it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0wzTzRRRRAB,"How do can you possibly justify 10$ for a handful of edamame? 20$ for a ramen with dirty separated broth that looks like cottage cheese and has a tiny piece of burned chashu in there? Everything was ridiculously salty, overpriced and didn‚Äôt taste good, won‚Äôt be coming back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0xDNVl3EAE,"Their dipping ramen is the perfect al dente texture with an umami broth that is the just the right amount of salty and spicy. Nothing that burns too much. Gyoza, whilst overpriced (like most places) is quite tasty and crunchy."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3FMOUNREAE,"Bomba has been a mainstay of dining in the East end of Melbourne for years now and has always done it well - great service, great tapas menu and we love the Worker's Lunch.  It survived through all the lockdowns and still is a fabulous place to go for a relaxed lunch or dinner with terrific staff.  I could not recommend it more highly..Julie  I ate the Worker's Lunch again with a friend yesterday - May 12/5....this is a fantastic menu for $25 each and as always the food was wonderful and the service excellent.  The slow cooked braised beef was as good as any piece of beef I have ever eaten.  Bomba rocks as always!  Julie"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekt5akV3EAE,"Excellent experience!! We went last minute for a work lunch and i was pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the food itself, tha range of flavours, epic drinks menu and most importantly the staff were knowledgeable, friendly and made the experience that whole lot better! thankyou for a wonderful lunch ill defo be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczhyNkNBEAE,Great selection of tapas and other dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemNHUlhREAE,"We visited after an early show and had booked online the day before. All we were after was a smattering of tapas and the obligatory carafe of sangria. Neither of these disappointed. Service was friendly and efficient. Considering the ingredients in each of our selections, the price was very reasonable. We enjoyed the free sparkling water."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMVpURURBEAE,"Delicious! Not a cheap eats night, but worth it for something different and special."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWEyN1N3EAE,"Have been twice now and Bomba has been consistent with lovely/professional service and delicious meals. Potato‚Äôs, lamb paella, flank steak all great flavours. Quick service is great for pre show dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWJpY1l3EAE,"Ordered some whiskey and a couple of pizza options. The pizzas were cold and when we told the staff, they cooked fresh ones for us. Great ambience and my friends and I loved the outdoor seating. Shall surely go again to try out thier food options."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2RuVkJBEAE,"We have been coming to Bombabar twice and they never fail us. We love Spanish tapas and the tapas menu at Bombabar are incredibly tasty.  Our all time favorite is the anchovy with salsa verde (melted in your mouth) and the croquetas with manchego cheese, so yumm...!!!  Nos gusta mucho!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnQ3ekhREAE,Great spanish bar/restaurant.  Perfect for pre-show meal and drinks.  Try the anchovies and paella!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHJMdVp3EAE,Good place for tapas with most dishes provided being of excellent quality
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbU15dXZBRRAB,First class. A must when in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaU1LdElREAE,"Had a grand time at Bomba last night with my friend, we had the set menu and dined at the bar which was amazing! The food was delicious, beef cheeks soft and tender, the cocktails also outstanding! Must try the Dragonfruit Bomba Bellini and Agua Fresca. Service was great, staff were friendly and attentive all night!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE1iZ3hnRRAB,Fabulous food and really good service with attentive wait staff. The cocktails were great too. We will be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEllN2pnRRAB,Great food and very good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0tXYjV3RRAB,So good wow. Mantaditos were mind blowing some of the best food I have ever had. The tapes themselves were a little underwhelming compared to the mantaditos however. Service was fantastic. Cocktails and drinks were fantastic.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNThUUG13RRAB,"Good food, super service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTlpLVpBEAE,"Underwhelming experience. Sauces drown all the food taste (for tapas). Not traditional tapas, definitely a fusion version, but not well delivered. Excellent service though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjhlZDhBRRAB,Good food & great drink. Cute tapas bar üëåüèΩ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDlQdG1nRRAB,"Been to this place for a workmate's dinner. Food was edible but felt like the service was too rushed. Was provided with a set shazzy banquet menu and the dessert was chorizo with chocolate dipping sauce. Felt like a very sad ending to our dinner show. But, Very romantic ambience and can find a few moderately dark cozy corners for lovers to have a private dinner feeling. Simply not interested to go again unless for a cozy dinner date with someone üòâ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmVlME1BEAE,"Great place, good food. But the portions are really tiny and quite expensive. Be ready to order at least 3-4 sides per person! As they are single portion sizes"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbllmMS1RRRAB,"P1 Wagyu and chicken liver good.  P2  beef tongue tastes good, it‚Äôs tender but it‚Äôs very sour, I hope the chef may consider about my opinion to lower the sourness of it. The octopus is just average level, not amazing or surprising, but just very average. The pork belly is ok, I like the combination with the almond, but my girlfriend said she doesn‚Äôt like it. The bone marrow is the best of the night, it taste so good, we both agree that one to be the best one of the night, if you find it hard to choose the tapas, this one is a must! The spanner crab salad is the second best, I love the taste, and the crab meat taste so fresh, love it!  P3  croquet is good with melting cheese in it, and the capsicum is the alternative choice we had that night since they don‚Äôt sell the burnt peach on menu any more, I think the capsicum one taste fresh and sweet, but maybe I am too familiar with Mexican food, the flavor of it is not a surprise for me. P4 the lamb shoulder paella taste good, the lamb shoulder taste tender and delicious, but my personal suggestion for others who wants to try it is not to squeeze too much lemon juicy on it, it will  influence your experience of tasting it in a bad way; and I think maybe a little bit more chopped parsley could do better. The potato sides are good as expected and the chipotle sauce is really good! P5 deserts are my regressions that night, the egg tart crust is not crispy at all, the bottom taste sticky and chewy, like the pastry is raw, it is definitely a disaster! The other one is the cr√®me Katelyn( I can barely remember the name of it) all I remember is the crust on the surface is just too hard and too thick! I am really not expecting it to be like that!  If it is not the desert that night our experience should definitely be 4-4.5stars, but the desert just kills my mood and appetite, I hope the chef may notice my comments."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSelpleWNnEAE,"Note we were at the rooftop bar. Everything was great except the music was too loud. We had to practically yell to talk. They did turn it down a tiny bit when asked, but still not an environment to catch up with old friends, which is what we were doing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNFl6akV3EAE,"Wow, what a find. The food was just delicious. I will definitely go back and try all the plates that I did not order. Great atmosphere and with the rooftop bar available before our dinner booking time. I love this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbU1hN0tBEAE,"Such a wonderful night!!! The service was good. All the FOH staff were wearing something stripe, all different,very very cute"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc1B5LWh3RRAB,"Fabulous food, venue and staff. We had a 90min dining experience at the bar, 9 course set menu. Delicious tastes (even for the diner with seafood allergy), perfect portions. We paired with fabulous cocktails (very more-ish) and finished off with desert. Staff were incredible, timing of dishes: perfect! I'm hard pressed to think of a better night in the last 5 years! Keep it up Bomba... Can't wait to return!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTVqWWZ3EAE,Cold food. Rice was crunchy under cooked. Tasted burnt. Chicken biryani had no chicken.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWRyai1nRRAB,Amazing flavour! Was looking for breakfast but the smell was so good I had to try. It was so delicious and inexpensive. ENJOY!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXBydjJRRRAB,Wow I missed this place during lockdown. So delicious and there are so many vegie options. Nomnomnom
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSck9uVWxBRRAB,"Absolutely love this place. The team is lovely and they made me discover Sri Lankan cuisine. I come here at least once a week, my colleagues became regular customers (even the Indians). Come on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for the kottu roti. Affordable price for good quality/quantity, what's not to like?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEs2MFJnEAE,Good food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMi1yRDRBRRAB,I just had lamb samosa and fish roll. No doubt about fish roll is just wow. And lamb samosa is best samosa i ever had for long time
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamQ2R1dREAE,Awesome non veg food... Good quantity.. Good taste...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa2I3a2dBRRAB,"Best Best curry in Melbourne CBD for price, service and taste!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa01QOUtREAE,Nourishing and tasty Sri Lankan food. Cuisines are of Sinhala origins and flavour. Good food in city.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdXNMQWZ3EAE,"I am perplexed as to how this restaurant has such a high rating.  A close friend is Sri Lankan and I worked at Tamil Feasts for years so I'm familiar with the cuisine and this is not authentic SL or delicious by any standard! After trying curries from here three times the third time leading to a bad stomach,  I consider it my civic duty to warn others about the place.  The curries are horrible! They're really sweet and don't have any diversity or subtlety of flavour.  And I've tried them all. The curry puffs are excellent though. However I highly doubt they make these inhouse. Do yourself a favour and go instead to Paramount Food Court or any nearby Malaysian for good curry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbXRQSXFBRRAB,Love the spicy food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCblBfaU1nEAE,"Craving for some Sri Lankan food, this was the closest I could find in the CBD so I went along with a friend. We both ordered a regular combo plate ($13.90) that consisted of savoury rice, meat curry (butter chicken), 2 vegetables (lentils and mushroom curry), papadam & your choice of chilli or chutney (I took curd). First, the positives: decent portion size, nice flavours and fast service. The negatives: small space, not very clean tables and a bit over priced for the menu.  As for the food, the lentils could've been cooked better. It was hard. The rice wasn't actually savoury. The little amount of curd on the side was simply a joke.  Unless in a pinch, I wouldn't highly recommend this restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaHZtS0t3EAE,Cheap and delicious - love this place!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbHZERkRREAE,"Came to this place regularly for lunch and man they sure know how to serve..  Food is nice, the ladies are kind and of course I didn't have to clear the plates from where others had left but I did it anyway because I truly appreciated their food.  Love love love this food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNHYtYkxnEAE,Brought back memories of childhood in Sri Lanka ü•≤. Amazing food for cheap! ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcU8ybjFRRRAB,My first experience was okay. There was nothing extraordinary about this place and food. Their system is weird and confusing and the staff didn't explain how their buffet works.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtc0xMQ1hnEAE,The food was really good especially hoppers. The guy on the front was very welcoming as well. Definitely value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnZqUWVnEAE,"Perfect place to get your curry fix for under $15. Biriyani combo today had veg rice, curry chicken , green apple curry and eggplant with papadam n other stuff. It was spicy and delicious. Decent portion size. There was a bit of a queue even around 12:45 and most of the  short eats were  gone.  So best get in early to try those."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eHY2aG5nRRAB,"the place is a bit run down, but the food is awesome, non nonsense quick curry, try their spicy beef curry - AMAZING !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMkw3OFh3EAE,"Good flavours but rice seriously undercooked, hard and crunchy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMDdhcUZBEAE,"I guess the best place to have a decent Sri Lankan lunch in the city for a great price. They are authentic and taste the way they should. The takeaway portion is somewhat smaller compared to what you can have when dining-in. Still, I wouldn't lower the rating as they just took me home every time I had my lunch there. :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEtYSDRBRRAB,Alex the waiter was excellent with his service.  Glad you have workers with a great sense of humour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDRXSXZ3RRAB,"Had a lovely evening at Encore the food was delicious, we shared the soft shell crab and zucchini fritters with soba noodles both where delicious but the orange br√ªl√©e with coconut and orange icecream was amazing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjhfNWZREAE,Do a great pre dinner drink
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNVpQYUpREAE,"Excellent! Very impressed, great food and service. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocHZuYUxBEAE,Cosy ambiance and excellent chai latte. Unfortunately the kitchen was already closed when we arrived but were gracious to accomodate us for a bowl of chips which was perfect as well. The staff are very friendly and nice. Definitely coming back for a meal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOXJDMG93RRAB,Service was very good. Dinner absolutely worth the money Not much people
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdF9hNllBEAE,"Family dinner, brilliant,  Bruno provided tremendous service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteE12bm9BRRAB,"Ordered a barramundi with grilled veggie and onion rings and it was among the best I had. The fish had crispy skin that didn't feel oily, succulent texture that's soft throughout. The veggie had the taste of grill in every bite. The onion rings are so well balanced that I finished every crumb. Definitely a place I'll come back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3Nud0JBEAE,Excellent customer service and good food. Cosy ambience. Overall it was a good dining experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnY3amZ3EAE,"Delicious food, beautifully presented and exemplary service. A wonderful evening! A special thank you to Bruno who couldn't have been more helpful and friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cl96WUJ3EAE,Beef was not done well. Too tough. Duck was not seasoned well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M3E2TUNnEAE,Absolutely Amazing food and Alex looked after us and did and amazing job. We didn‚Äôt just feel like a number but felt so welcome into the resturant. Thanks Alex.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMEtUR3V3RRAB,good service and reasonably priced...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOS1TejhRRRAB,We stayed at the hotel and went for drinks and desert at Encore. Bruno was behind the bar and was amazing. Everything A class here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNEtEbHBBRRAB,Great for delicious dinner pre show. We walked in without a reservation (it was early) to ask if we could have a quick single course meal pre show and was greeted warmly.  The meal came quickly and was delicious. Lovely table with linen. Not too pricey. Excellent 'on the ball' staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbjZMdzJ3RRAB,Nice place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaXBYMlhnEAE,Delicious food well cooked and lovely combination of wine.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4NWVtcWxBRRAB,Good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdmRMSE13EAE,"We went there with a Groupon voucher for my birthday. It was great that they gave me a free cocktail. Disappointing that the meat arrived a good 5 minutes before the vegetables and the chicken breast when you cut into it near the bone had blood in it which was off putting. The mushrooms and the steak my friend ate were reported to be amazing. Cannot fault the staff, they were very friendly but the late serving of the vegetables and the blood in my chicken did impact on the meal itself."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNFlTc1V3EAE,Nice ambient light and experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbWRXSlBBEAE,The restaurant feels like a hotel restaurant (it is - but it feels like it has no personality) - the service was attentive and pleasant. We were there on a voucher - and had prepaid a very reasonable price for our three course meal and drink. The thing that I felt let the place down was that everything tasted ‚Äòprepared way in advance‚Äô and if I‚Äôd had to $70 for my main meal I would have been very disappointed. It was just good - not great. (I had the steak and lobster) The desserts average.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaWJqaVRnEAE,Good little place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M0p2SGFnEAE,"Big portion sizes, fair prices, amazing staff !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dVBLNkxBEAE,As always another top Anzac Day at this pub.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHRTMXNBRRAB,Nice pub doubling as a comedy venue located at a ge top end of town.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXRtVXFnRRAB,"What a fabulous pub! We had reservations for 6:30pm as we were headed to Comedy Theatre for 8pm show‚Ä¶well, traffic was crazy and we were half hour late for our reservation (we had tried to call but no answer). Went to the bar, and we were seated promptly and then asked the waitress if we would have time to get food. She went to check and see what she could do. Came back within seconds, saying to follow her to bar to place order. Felt like a VIP. Food and drinks ordered. Drinks given immediately and food came out in 20 minutes. Great service. Tacos, wedges, fish/chips amazing. Finished with 5 minutes to spare, getting to show. Outstanding pub, cool atmosphere and vibe. Felt welcomed and they did all they could to make sure we were taken care of. Highly recommend and we will be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHZpbmRnEAE,"Went and a comedy show here as part of the Melbourne international comedy festival, the service at the bar was very good, but Adam Rozenbachs wasn't."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHFEbTNnRRAB,"The pub itself was great but the comedy act wasn't very funny, we saw Tim Hewit"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScExUTlRBEAE,Great food and a good place to see stand-up comedy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaU5xd3VRRRAB,Saw a comedy show at the coopers and it was a great night. Giving 4 stars purely for the wonderful bar staff. They went above and beyond helping us with our tickets and also making sure the footy was on the tv upstairs! Lovely people and a great vibe. Food was ok however my burger was over cooked.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVBUYmdRRRAB,"Food was great, service from bar staff great, and seen Sarah Maree Cameron for comedy Festival, great set and perfect. Recommend a meal, drink before going in to see a Comedian"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd1BxbFZBEAE,Nice bar with a few local craft beers on tap. Very loud. Just stopped in for one pot of Bricklanes Pale Ale. Sports were playing on some large TV's. Goooo sports team. Yeah.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMl9MV29BRRAB,Great place for food and drink and a great venue for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival staff were fantastic and accommodating with my wife allowing us to go up early to get up the stairs before everyone else. Watched Sarah Maree Cameron and her show One Womb Please absolutely hysterical ü§£ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmU2QVRREAE,"Coopers Inn, great place for a Guinness, but you‚Äôll be hard stretched to find a coopers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXEySkF3EAE,Had a function in the private room upstairs of Coopers Inn and was relatively impressed. We started with roving canap√©s which consisted of four items they weren‚Äôt to my taste so I saved my appetite for main which was a choice of four dishes.  I opted for the eye fillet and there were also five different side dishes to share. I was obsessed with the fries which were had a very yummy salty seasoning on them and I probably polished off a bowl of my own. The steak was delicious and very filling given all the potato I consumed! We finished with cheeseboards which weren‚Äôt the most impressive looking but perfect to pick at given how full we were
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEp5emJ3EAE,"Lovely staff, really good comedy. FYI- no elevator upstairs, so it's not wheelchair accessible to comedy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUoyR0lnEAE,Nice pub worth dropping in for a cold beer
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoXzR2SjN3RRAB,"Pretty good pub in the CBD. Good, menu options. Food is a bit pricey though for what you get. Cocktails /spirits are also a bit pricey. Main feedback is that service has been quite slow recently during lunch times (12.30pm - 2pm) which is not ideal for those working & have limited time for lunch. Yesterday, a group of us (6 ppl) came for lunch at 12.30pm. Wasn't that busy (tables available around us); yet we were waiting over half hour for food, which meant 2 colleagues had to leave early & one didn't even get to have any food. Not ideal"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M09mLVFBEAE,Lots of vegan options here. Recommend the tofu steak! Staff was well accommodating to dietary needs.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4akxDXzFRRRAB,Slow service but good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cUpMUkFREAE,Beautiful food especially the octopus dumplings but the plastic plates and bowls made it tacky.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczliM0FnEAE,Great food the best sukiyaki.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXFTRjZBRRAB,Tasty fried rice noodle So many veg options to choose from Loved the sake too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkkycjZRRRAB,"Food was good, not huge servings. Took almost an hour to get all out order placed on the table, but I think they were short staffed. Was a bit loud but not unbearable"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUpUMm1nRRAB,Unfortunately we ordered and paid at 7:50pm on a Tuesday night. 5 meals only 3 arrived at 8:40.... still waiting for two meals and the close time is 9pm. Don't bother for a quick meal with kids.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEpPekx3EAE,Staff are very good so is the food!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzktV0x3EAE,Such a lovely Japanese restaurant! Came here by myself in a raining night and got surprised by the food here. Will definitely come again with my friends. üòä ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGNEOG1BRRAB,The food is very much average.  Not authentic. The service is good but there's no efforts put into the food.  I went pass many times and thought to give it a try but will not come back. Don't  think it's owned or cooked by the Japanese.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODZxTUJ3EAE,Authentic Japanese restaurant. Not trying to be fancy. Homely feeling
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMDZpVkNBEAE,Overpriced but very quick and nice service. Very practical if you‚Äôre having a quick dinner before watching a play in the theatre across the street.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZzQyQnFnRRAB,A bit overpriced for the quality
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN1pDWm1BRRAB,"Don‚Äôt bother going there, service is super slow, expects to wait for at least an hour before getting your food during the weekend. Lack of staff, small serve and not really authentic.  The place is a bit rundown, dirty and sticky floor. Not recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXFEQ1V3EAE,"It is a very good traditional Japanese restaurant, definitely worth going to!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHBUa2hBRRAB,"Guys! Let's be serious, I don't get the 4.3 rating.... ,Food  is bad! We tried to provide feedback but we were told no one else complained so surely the flood must be good. I don't seen any reason why you would go there, food, service or atmosphere..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX0thS193RRAB,"Although the food is flavoursome, they will down portion the main to an entree size. We ordered salmon steak as main and got 80 grams of salmon on a sizzling plate. Ordered Chicken ju which was batter with bits of chicken in them for flavoring. Also ordered beef yakiniku (or something along those lines) and got bean shoots with slithers of beef. I can't stand places downsizing food and charging full price and leaving you hungry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX00teVZREAE,Really long wait time. It's been close to an hour and I still haven't gotten my food :(
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdWRLeldBEAE,"The saddest Oyako-don I have ever seen on earth. It had no flavour, dry, and the egg was throughly cooked to a big clump. Tasted like nothing and not even the soy sauce on the table could save it.  My partner ordered a main of yakiniku and it had like 10 pieces of beef that costed 16 bucks‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more hot plate to see then there is meat????  The floor had only one waitress and it was busy, but our food took ONE HOUR to arrive.  A total waste of time and money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNGY2UWNREAE,Yamato restaurant is a good restaurant. It has lots of food and deserts. You can find all of the Japanese food in Yamato restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMU5yaC1BRRAB,Normal place to eat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaWV6aWdRRRAB,Quaint and intimate Japanese restaurant that feels quite authentic. I ordered the salmon bento box and it was very fresh and delicious. The staff were lovely and hospitable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtb1piZU9BEAE,"Experience but worth it. Great place, best food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ01icGVREAE,"One waitress only covering 30 customers. Everyone must order and pay at the counter and then grab the water from the counter. Interestingly, they have the option to use Japanese floor mats for floor seating (2 tables available at the back). To go to the toilet (clean), you need to walk all the way through the outside alley to the back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aTRTUVFREAE,Good yuncha with lots of variety Must get the cute and creamy custard buns
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk55aWZ3EAE,"Amazing food! Typical Hong Kong style service - quick, effeciant but can but cold (or  some people might find it a bit rude?) The place can be a bit cleaner thou, where we sat the floor was a bit sticky"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eklQXzFBRRAB,"Atmosphere was the only thing that was decent.  Food quality- Came from Perth to Melbourne to try the quality of dimsum. Dimsum was terrible and over priced compared to Perth. Taste was below standard as well as portion was smaller than I'd expected.  Service at the start wasn't good, booked for 4 with 3 adults, 1 toddler and 1 infant- The guy was stressed out when I said 3 adults and 2 kids when I booked for 4 seats and almost had an argument- Might have been a language barrier or miscommunication."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NU03MVhBEAE,"We had Tim Sum for lunch. Lots of varieties that you can't find in other restaurants. The food was yummy, and service was top-notch. By lunchtime, it was fully booked. A fee will be charged for all credit cards and Eftpos."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OFBydnpnRRAB,"Our friend invited us to secret kitchen for Yum Cha after their wedding registration. Food was authentic service was great. They helped with the cake we brought from Laurent, would recommend secret kitchen to everyone. I have been to their CBD Chinatown branch and Doncaster Westfield branch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z05QU09BEAE,"Looks can be deceiving and this was the case from the laneway outside looking in at Secret Kitchen. Once inside, impressive decor and lighting and lovely friendly service. Ordered BBQ duck and pork meat platter with side pork and prawn fried rice and seasonal greens. Very nice ,tasty and delicious food, however a touch more expensive than you expect with your normal Asian fare. Was it good ....yes. Was it the best duck ever ... not quite. Would I return and dine here again ........ absolutely so, especially to try the Yum Cha menu perhaps instead."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzlLSE93EAE,"Came here couple times for yumcha but recently back for dinner. The food was average, a little bit salty but customer service was shocking. A middle aged male staff was extremely rude, legit nearly yelling in front of all of us, making sarcastic comments and give out unnecessary negative vibe and ruined the whole night. The other staffs were ok. We know it‚Äôs Saturday night but legit we don‚Äôt need the staff to start yelling at customers when ordering, basic etiquette is at least needed. People please beware before going here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajVUdjFnRRAB,One of the worst experiences we have ever had at a restaurant. Food was great but the customer service and energy of the place was pathetic. It feels like customers are nothing more than a dollar value for these people
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTllcXl3RRAB,"So, so, so good. Dim sum is certainly one of the best in Melbourne and EUGH, the chicken feet are so good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWJtemNBEAE,The food is delicious ü§§ Recommended Recommended ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2VTcDBRRRAB,"I was shouted a meal here, so don't want to be too harsh, seemed overly priced for the fair. Small portions at diffrent price points..  hard to keep track of spend.  2 or 3 dishes where excellent, the fried prawn  pastry thing was actully amazing, prawns had that big prawn flavour and fresh..padtry really nice and most of my stars are here for that, standout,The chinese broccoli with the housin type sauce..  that sauce should go on nearly everything (maybe the fried prawn thing too)  and prbly the only real vegetable you can order.. lastly which is something I never eat was the octopus, I had some and I quite liked it, I was sure I wouldn't, so a real surprise, I ate most of the serving. But the rest of the food was just dumplings which pretty much all tasted alike, nothing special.  Worth going once. But I'm not running back considering portion and price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSam9XTE1REAE,"Excellent yum Cha, very busy , very authentic"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXBXWVhBEAE,"I have eaten many Cantonese morning teas, and this one is my favorite. Each has its own good products, and here, the overall is very good. Some friends from Guangdong told me that this restaurant is very authentic. Came here to eat with friends. Fortunately, we booked in advance, otherwise the queue would be really long. Regarding ordering, they will push the cart directly. It is very convenient to choose a lot of ready-made food directly, and you can taste many kinds. If two people eat a lot, about 150 can eat very well. There will be surcharge on weekends, and the overall price is high."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXVYYTVnRRAB,"The last time we went there for yum cha we had great food and service, however, this time was quite disappointing.  We brought our own wine and was prepared to pay corkage charge as it is fair and reasonable for restaurants to charge $10 - $15 per your own bottle but to be charged $10 per person is way too excessive. The wait staff said that we were allowed to bring one bottle and there will be a corkage charge, BUT have neglected to tell us how much. Then before we had settled into our seats we were prompted to order.  We immediately ordered the Steamed Red Rice Crispy Prawn Rice Roll from their popular dim sum menu and it was a waiting game. After five reminders to different wait staff, we were told by a very attentive and apologetic waitstaff that it wasn‚Äôt passed on to the kitchen. By now it was near closing time so we ask to cancel but was told to wait a further 10 mins. when the special deluxe dim sum finally arrived; it was obviously a rushed job as the RED rice crispy prawn were barely blushing pink rice roll with only one rice roll filled with crispy prawn and the rest were stuffed with vegs. The overall experience was not great this time round."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXZEYTZ3RRAB,"Amazing service, fast & furious. Quality food with very high quality ingredients (we ate at a few yum cha places with trolley style and so far this is the best). Of course, quality for money, there are cheaper places but not as top notch as this one"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdktTWGR3EAE,Honestly the best yumcha I've had in Melbourne by a long shot
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM1BUekpnEAE,Good service. Dim Sum is good but not best in that price range
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSekxtMnJ3RRAB,"The food tastes Cantonese~ The service is good~ The environment is good~ Unfortunately, there is no morning tea dim sum menu at night~ ü•≤Many people in Guangdong drink night teaü§£"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdE9XWUtREAE,The service was outstanding on Saturday night. The food came out fast and tasted delicious. They were able to seat out 2 year old on a booster seat and give him small cutlery and plates to eat off. Very good for families. Definitely recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cExESFFREAE,Absolutely delicious food. Staff are very attentive and friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDl2emF3EAE,Great food service and value for money
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDdXVzJBRRAB,The menu is varied and delicious
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjlHODhRRRAB,Institution
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczVxYzFRRRAB,Nice chinese restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazd2SXRRRRAB,Absolutely incredible experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVlIaHlnRRAB,"best yum cha in town, 6 years of consistent quality of service and food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVp6M1lnEAE,"Food was delicious, but the service was really subpar. Presented the bill before we finished eating. Rushing to clear the table for 2nd round of crowds supposedly, but the restaurant was at best 50% full and many empty tables even on a Saturday peak dinner time. Consider improving the dining experience otherwise plenty of choices in the Chinatown to not go back to this one. Delicious food is not worth it if the overall experience is memorably bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3J6b3BnRRAB,good service attitude
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXJPeGl3RRAB,"Delicious yumcha, meticulous and friendly service, reasonable price! Ten years old diner!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXRDWXdnRRAB,Brilliant.  Best Chinese in China town... and anywhere else.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNW96dmdRRRAB,Authentic and delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN08tTEtREAE,Institution for Melbourne and the yum cha scene. Our kids loved it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFBfSTBRRRAB,Good place and the yum cha for lunch is great.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEt6QVZnEAE,"The food is OK. But horrible service, the staffs have severe racial discrimination. If you are white people, you are treated well and get a table soon, if you are Asian, you need to wait. The staff throw cups and dishes facing down on the tables and have no sense of hygiene."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDUtRU1BEAE,"Whilst the food was quick to be served and lovely, our party of 5 were seated close to the kitchen entrance. We could only assume that there was an open rubbish bin around the corner of the partition wall as there were 5 small flies constantly flying over our table. Throughout our entire meal we were seen swatting flies which were attempting to land on our food. When we complained to a staff member, she said ‚Äúoh really‚Äù and looked up but did nothing. To top the night off our senior male waiter had the personality of a wet mop and also forgot my drink order. He didn‚Äôt even acknowledge us when we were leaving‚Ä¶. Just rude really. I was very disappointed as I‚Äôve dined at Shark Fin twice previously and really talked it up to my other dinner guests. We won‚Äôt be going back again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjY3dWxRRRAB,Food and service was amazing. We had a banquet for 2. We also had cocktails which were delicious. We will definitely be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzdU9UYTFnRRAB,Good n friendly service with beautiful food at a reasonable price. Plenty of smiling faces.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2UyRmFnEAE,Proper Cantonese yum cha experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk9YZWxnRRAB,We had a firday night dinner at Bodega Underground and as we booked rather late we were seated at the bar. We had the ‚Äúfeed me‚Äù menu which was delicious and everything on it was gluten free. The gluten free churros were outstanding!  While the ambience of the bar was nice(underground style) we felt that the staff could have been a bit warmer and friendlier. Overall was a good experience and we would be back for the food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N05TYmVBEAE,Very average food at an inflated price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4clBYYV93RRAB,"Absolute shocking experience. They force you to get the feed me menu which is really just another way of getting more money out of you. We wouldn‚Äôt have ordered half the things they bought out. The food was terrible, drinks tasted like petrol, staff were inattentive. We asked them to take 3 plates full of food away  due to it being so bad and they didn‚Äôt even ask if everything was okay. Biggest waste of money, have no idea how they have such good ratings, don‚Äôt waste your time."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjZVUhAB,amazing gluten free food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzk2ck93EAE,Their margaritas are fire üî• Their churros too. Great night.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMC1PYk9nEAE,Food was phenomenal! Good place to go for Mexican and some drinks.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGJuc2J3EAE,"I had an amazing experience at Bodega Underground restaurant located in Melbourne CBD. It's truly a hidden gem that you shouldn't miss. The highlight of my meal were the Tacos De Fruoles, made with black beans. Chilaquiles roja - it was simply awesome! The flavors were so rich and authentic, I couldn't get enough. The ambience of the restaurant is also super awesome.  I highly recommend making a booking in advance as these guys are always booked out. I'm glad we did, as it ensured we got a spot at this fantastic restaurant. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.  Overall, if you're looking for great Mexican food and a wonderful dining experience, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWVQd3hBRRAB,Great vegan options and superior mescal list! This place has a really fun vibe too and the service is excellent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNmJyd1pBEAE,"Bodega had gone viral on tik tok so I decided to check out. Corn, chicken wings were the best. Lamb dish and taco dip was very average though they were highly rated. Staff are amazing but their outfits are a little too laid back. The girl serving us looked like she woke up and came to work in her home clothes. But she was a nice girl. So overall good place to try but not what I expected . Churros were the worst"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVlDVldREAE,One of our favorite restaurants in our whole month long trip to Australia. Everything was so fresh and amazing. Staff was super helpful and kind and drinks were fantastic. Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnRybFhBEAE,Overall good inexpensive food but the noise level was way too high for early in the evening. We were also seated at the front door and every time it opened there was a loud shrieking noise - door hinge definitely needs WD40!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanNuR0JBEAE,This place has a great atmosphere. It was pretty full at the time. The menu was very different from other Mexican restaurants I have tried however the food was was not quiet as enjoyable as what I expected. I‚Äôm pretty sure half the order was forgotten and then done in a rush only after I asked about it 15 minutes after getting the rest of our food. I was disappointed with the experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3BudG5BRRAB,"Found this little gem open at 11.30pm Friday and couldn't be happier! The food was amazing, cocktails were amazing, the people serving us were absolutely fantastic even making us a secret cocktail.  Will 100% be back for more tacos and cocktails üç∏"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3Nld2FBEAE,"So much fun, the vibes were kind of dark, religious Mexican iconography, music was awesome, and the staff were super sweet (even though so busy); our server Shen really took her time to explain the dishes and drinks, easy, no fuss, Super yum yum."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSek1McDZnRRAB,"Fantastic place to eat. Great variety of dishes with options for different food restrictions. Chill vibe, very friendly staff and service (shout out to Zac for being a legend and friendly). The tacos were fresh, filling and a nice variety of options. Definitely coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbE9xOG53RRAB,"One of the best bottomless brunches you can go to. We went here at 11am for a bottomless brunch and Bodega Underground did not disappoint. The bottomless includes a 5 course meal and unlimited cocktails within a 90 minute session. As soon as we sat down our first meal came out and our drinks order taken. Within 5 minutes our drinks were served. Once we were halfway through our first drinks, our waiter came up to take our next drinks order without hesitation. We were allowed to change our cocktail of choice constantly and we were never without a drink as he consistently checked with us if we needed another drink. The food also came out as soon as we were finishing up the previous meal and so we were never without food as well. The food was actually amazing, as were the cocktails which were all of great value. The staff were all very friendly and very efficient. I would definitely return here for another bottomless brunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEt5d2Z3EAE,Been sick all day from the food here. Don't believe the positive reviews they must be bots/ people who were too intoxicated to remember the food. Tacos tasted like cardboard and the ribs were fatty with no meat. Sauces and seasoning (lack there of) were poor. Most of the food seemed microwaved! Service was mediocre and we were rudely rushed out by one of the waitresses. Plenty of nice restaurants on Little Bourke and you can pay the same price and eat much better!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0l2OGt3RRAB,"Very busy so book early. Because it's busy you would think the food was exceptional but it left me underwhelmed. Must admit the corn it's to die for and the service always gives it extra stars, but you have a time slot so the food is rushed out which gives a get in get out vibe.  Not sure why but one of our friends slipped over and no one helped!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb09IanhnRRAB,"A fun Mexican restaurant! Had the pre theatre dinner and we were absolutely stuffed afterwards! Great value for the variety and amount of food, including drinks and dessert! The corn is a must-have and packed full of flavour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0pyODl3RRAB,"On Ftidays and the weekends @bodegamelbourne do a fantastic brunch deal. It‚Äôs a set menu which starts with elote and finished with churros with a delicious dulce de leche. The dishes in between were fried chicken wings, chicken chilaquiles and birria quesataco. Everything was delicious and packed full of Mexican flavours.  There is a decent list of Mexican inspired cocktails that we quickly made our way through. We particularly enjoyed the Paloma. At $75pp for lunch and free flow this was a great deal.  The restaurant itself is bustling with people enjoying their Friday lunch. The service is efficient and while not the friendliest we were looked after quickly and got everything we needed.  This is a brunch I would happily do often."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzd2T053EAE,Food was amazing. A little noisy and we were ushered out pretty quickly so we couldn't enjoy the space as long as we would have liked to.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzR1SVFREAE,"All our food came out at once, whereas we had ordered entree then mains, which was a bit annoying, service was friendly and food was good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdTZqRXdRRRAB,Yummy food and drinks and very quick after ordering.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjllNWRnEAE,Wicked margs and great dishes. Vegan friendly too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTZ5NlZnEAE,Great spot for a late night feed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczR1c3p3RRAB,"This is a must-go for gluten-free or coeliac diners! The fish taco is amazing and the churros are a dream given you can‚Äôt find gf churros anywhere else. We also got the lamb ribs which were a bit oily for my liking - but then again, that‚Äôs how lamb ribs are so if you are ok with fatty meat then you‚Äôll probably enjoy. Will definitely come back here - mainly for those fish tacos!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cklpaGlRRRAB,Great atmosphere and vibe.  Friendly knowledgeable service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek9lRXZnRRAB,"Love don‚Äôt tell Aunty in Surry hills and Daughter in law is just as good Prepare for great food, beautiful decor and fabulous cocktails"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LU02YTBRRRAB,Excellent
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMDlmNXJRRRAB,"Waste of money and time!!!! ‚õîÔ∏èüö´üëéüëéüëéüëé Being honest, it was an awful experience yesterday. ‚Äî Overrated ‚Äî Expensive ‚Äî Portion is very less ‚Äî Sub standard taste ‚Äî Not good quality served for this price $$$ Overrated expensive sub standard quality with less portion being served‚Ä¶ !!! The ball of happiness turned out to be ball of sadness- 4.5 Aud for each piece is total waste of money‚õîÔ∏èüö´üëé !!! Creamy curry croquettes- another disaster for a price of 6.5 aud each. You can get better, delicious with a reasonable price in other eateries for sure.üëéüëéüëéüëé !!! Basmati rice - you could still feel it was not properly drained and prepared- another disappointment from unauthentic Indian restaurant !!! Lastly unauthentic butter chicken - OMG you could a better version in other restaurants e.g chin chin or khabbay or capati for sure who love to try delicious food with reasonable price. üôèüôèüôèWith due respect, it is not recommended for people who do not want to throw their hard earned money for such a overrated expensive food ‚õîÔ∏èüö´üëéüëéüëéüëé"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzZiNlJBEAE,"It's an amazing experience, and I enjoyed it really well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjhlanRRRRAB,The food at Daughter in Law is so delicious!! We keep coming back! Service is always top notch and the vibe is really cozy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjh6T1BnEAE,"Appalling experience. Booked for a two hour sitting, were rushed to order then served  huge amounts of food over 45 minutes, before being presented with the bill. Never again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzV1RkNBEAE,We had a wonderful evening. The food (banquet) was delicious and  we loved the chai icecream sticks for dessert. The service was really efficient and unobtrusive. The pink walls cast a flattering glow over us all. Thanks!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzQ3dmF3EAE,It was an amazing third experience last night. Quick service. Amazing food. The cauliflower is incredible! I travel quite a distance to get here and I‚Äôll be back again for sure!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScl9mSFd3EAE,"What a glorious find! Food delicious, we had chefs menu, with a selection of 5 curries that they refill if you need or want! The other two stand outs for me were the happiness balls and the cauliflower, amazing. Atmosphere is sort of mesmerising created with pink lights and flowers and the service great. Highly recommend a visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDdUYlFREAE,Excellent place to dine in. Good food and service. Take the offer and fill your tummy...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDg2TU5nEAE,"Amazing atmosphere, staff were super friendly, and most importantly, the food was amazing. Recently celebrated my third year anniversary with my partner, and honestly couldn't have picked a better place to do so. Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaC1iWUZBEAE,Loved the food! Highly recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTlmUkNnEAE,Always great as usual
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNDRmZnl3RRAB,Awesome restaurant... can't wait to go back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1pUNUlREAE,Delicious feed me menu with a lovely ambience and decorations. Would recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSallMZ0dREAE,Love this restaurant so much. The vibes and the music and the food. Especially that cauliflower dish. SOOOOOO good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamNUZUlBEAE,Absolutely love this place. Food is amazing. The lunch thali is my go to and it never disappoints.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaFpTM3NRRRAB,I was expecting more considering the pricey items on the menu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWFtMG5BRRAB,"Fantastic service and atmosphere, beautiful fun decor. Cocktails amazing & food just so deliciously tasty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmNITGF3EAE,"Delicious meal, with friendly service and overall great value. Definitely dine again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd1pfdGZBEAE,Food and service was amazing!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaG9mWXN3RRAB,Beautifully decorated space. Very tasty food. However we felt that it was overpriced.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbW9QbkRnEAE,"The ambience & vibes are 10/10, it has this amazing, homely vibe. The selection of cutleries & plates was very thoughtful. However, the food was a major disappointment. Balls of Happiness were amazing! We had Colonel Tso‚Äôs Cauliflower ‚Äì It was super sour. Tandoori chicken was a joke ‚Äì it was just some grilled tasteless chicken Butter chicken and naan were decent, and Kulfi had a very strong taste of saffron ‚Äì it was so strong it was overpowering the basic flavours of kulfi. The staff was friendly, the service was good, despite being super busy the average wait time for our order was less than 5 mins. I know they brand themselves as ‚ÄúNOT YOUR TYPICAL INDIAN JOINT‚Äù ‚Äì I think that‚Äôs correct as other typical Indian joints have some taste in their food. Prices were very high in comparison to the quality of food received. Would not recommend this place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnNYcm9nRRAB,"The food was Delicious and we felt like the stars of a Bollywood movie. 5 stars for food, drinks and the amazing decor."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjYyS2FREAE,"Such a unique experience. The food is 5-star and mind blowing but the service staff and sommelier are approachable, friendly and relaxed making the experience all that more special."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjlpaURBEAE,Went here for our 2nd anniv dinner & was very happy! Creative set course list ü´∂ and worth the money!! Highlight of the meal would be the pork belly & their snacks!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmZqODh3RRAB,"We went to dine at Sunda for our anniversary and it was an incredible experience from the beginning to the end. We sat at the bar (highly recommend) and watched the chefs busy themselves in preparing the dishes. Every dish was prepared meticulously and packed full of flavour. We loved how the flavors married themselves between Southeast Asia and Australia. Coming from a Southeast Asian background, the flavors were spot on and reminded us a lot of our mother's cooking. Between us, we shared 12 different dishes! So we left feeling very well-fed. Thanks for the delicious food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWNMaE93EAE,Thanks for an awesome night!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE5DRkVREAE,Amazing from beginning to end! My friend and I had a wonderful dinner at Sunda this evening. Each course was beautifully presented and full of flavour. The staff were welcoming and professional. We will definitely dine again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjRIdG1nRRAB,"An amazing dining experience! Loved almost every dish on the set menu, the entrees especially were DELICIOUS. Service was a little iffy at times. We were sitting at our table for about 30 mins with no menus, before a staff member came to check in on us. Seemed like they were a little overwhelmed. However we weren‚Äôt in a rush and they apologized and gave us cocktails on the house! Portions were far more generous than expected, we left feeling very well fed!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTVMbFhnEAE,"Super yum food, excellent service and Awesome experience.A perfect fine dine restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczV5M2R3EAE,"It doesn't work - better flavour combination from the local chip shop. Over complicated and confused. The barramundi was totally over powered by the orange sauce. The mango ice cream was great, but non of us were getting the grated white chocolate accompaniment. Wine was hugely over priced for what it was too. The only dish that 'worked' from a flavour combination was the chicken. Having read some of the rave reviews we must have had a rogue serving or there's a distinct 'King's new clothes' element going on."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3NDUFNREAE,"Inventive Adventurous Provocative. One of the best and hottest restaurant in Melbourne. Finger licking Asian inspired food presented in a fine dining setting. The food menu is simply superb and drinks menu huge. Only choice available is a 4 course menu - 4 small starters are fixed and you choose the remaining 3 courses. All 3 courses have wide variety consisting of vegetarian, meat and seafood options. The drinks menu can't be more detailed. A must try would be an understatement for this young chefs restaurant making waves across Melbourne!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEtYcEt3EAE,Tucked away in an unassuming lane way away from the hustle and bustle busy street of Chinatown is a hidden gem called Sunda. The way they prepare the food is exceptional. Truly an elevated dining experience. Definitely recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeE12NkN3EAE,Great food and service. Very happy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDdPTnVnRRAB,"Just go here!  (You're Welcome)... and trust me on the vegemite roti... even if you don't do vegemite. JDFI! you're welcome ;p One of my very favourite dining experiences of all time. Food is flavourful and intense, balanced and full.  Wine list is equally diverse.  Great for Vegetarians. Share EVERYTHING, and enjoy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMDVhWmZ3EAE,Could not recommend this place highly enough.  The only thing the eclipsed the spectacular food was the sublime service.  Brilliant. Well done Sunda Dining!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmNxaDVRRRAB,"3 course tasting menu was great but not mind blowing. Good selection of dishes with each with some Thai flavours. Some of the dishes were a bit unbalanced on the flavour, and had hot food served with cold sauces.  Service was amazing, and nice restaurant decor!"

Crispy, creamy, and yum!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmYtVi1RRRAB,"I have nothing negative to say about Sunda. visited on valentine's day and we were treated like royalty! walking in and taken upstairs to the beatifully laid out, spacious and industrail style top level, it felt so intimate yet so wide! the service was impeccabl, with staff extra friendly, attentive and thorough/knowledgeable when explaining the menu and each item as it was laid out. the whole vibe of the restaurant is calm, you can tell extra care and thought it put into each dish which you can see the chefs working (seamlessly and neatly) among the kitchen. as for the food..wow! easily some of the best and top food i've had in melbourne, it was really an experience. each item (especially the snacks) were just bursting with flavour, each element purposefully placed and paired perfectly. i loved everything, particularly the barramundi which got tastier as i ate more..somehow?! the egg is so unique, and the simple yet tasty desserts did the perfect job to refresh the palette after such a flavoursome and rich meal. the canele surprise were a delight. I cannot fault a thing. a must visit - perhaps for an extra special occasion and for an absolute adventure for your tastebuds! thankyou Sunda, we felt so special!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobnVfSzRRRRAB,"Amazing. Plus, we had a voucher, which made it much better. Don't skip the scampi dish!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoN09pY25RRRAB,"What a great dining experience in Melbourne! Like the other reviews have stated, all the snacks were delicious but the oysters are a must. We got the egg noodles as an addition which complimented the barramundi and chicken well. The staff were very friendly and provided excellent service. They also serve a really smooth margarita."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMVBPQkRBEAE,Great food friendly stuff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLU1LTWZREAE,"Im gonna be honest, the food is good, but not my thing, I can tell is good quality products and the flavors are an experience.  I don't know if it's intentional or not... but it took us 2 hours to get all the food, by the end I just wanted to leave without the mains. I don't know if the idea is so people can stay there longer or what, but there is no way I'm coming back, I wouldn't sit and wait 2 hours for any meal in the world... not even a grand slamwich.  The tip is just a joke, $300 between 2 people should be enough to pay salaries. I had to tell 3 different waiters for water because it took them more than 15 min to just get us tap water... this is on a restaurant with more than 10 employees... I have seen restaurants with 4 employees giving better service.  The reason I give 4 stars is because I have this conception that the 2 hour experience is intentional, the food quality is good, but overall this is not my thing at all, wouldn't recommend and can't even begin to understand what kind of people like this experience... if the 2 hours is not an intentional thing, I would probably just give a 3 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcTdXcFlREAE,"Amazing dining experience courtesy of my wife :) the degustation menu was superb, the snacks were amazing and would highly recommend getting the egg Hokkien noodles along with your main dishes. In fact, we hope the noodles get turned into a main - they‚Äôre that goood!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN1otV0xBEAE,Simply stunning. I‚Äôm not going to give details- just go there and see for yourself
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCX0tqYWlRRRAB,Incredible fine dining experience. Great flavors of south East Asian foods and local Australian cuisine. Oysters were really good as part of appetizer. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre thinking about going there.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCak5hN2NnEAE,"The food was sensational, the service excellent and overall a great night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjRpbXBnRRAB,Great food and service. Will come back again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazVhY0pnEAE,Favourite thai restaurant in Melbourne. Best Moo Ka Ta in town
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHFyN1dREAE,A little pricey but the food was delicious and more authentic that your average Thai restaurant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTdtT0l3EAE,I will always come back to this place. Everything is delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeVltODZnRRAB,"We went here with a group of 5. The beef sushi was their best dish but they ran out of it. We tried chicken wings, dumplings and noodles. All were ok. The reason for our 3 star rating was this. We asked for the bill and when we went to pay we realised on the bill the price that was written on the menu and what they attempted to charge us differed. When I showed them there was no apology they just amended the bill to the correct price. They had written higher prices on our bill than the actual price that was written on the menu. Motto of the story always check your bill. We won't go back unfortunately."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeTdmUGtnRRAB,"We came to So Thai because we drove pass and were interested with the restaurant vibe. It wasnt busy, but the staffs made it difficult in choosing the table.. (ex. This & that table is already booked, etc), although we were at the restaurant for 3 hours.. it was still many empty the table. We were put at the front with small table. The food are ok, but can be better. Green curry chicken is full of chicken breast, and the salad size is small. The price is a bit expensive and not worth it. Sorry, I wont be back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWJHSXdRRRAB,Nice decor and environment. Food was above average was quite authentic tasting
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtLS1QbFhBEAE,"It‚Äôs a nice restaurant located just opposite Queen Victoria market, so it‚Äôs convenient to have a nice meal here after. There‚Äôs a outside area too, and the inside ambience is very nice.  Food didn‚Äôt take long to come up, it‚Äôs tasty, but a little salty. Only realised that they have ice cream on our way out. Haha! There‚Äôs a Thai milk tea flavour üòÅ  Will come back again to try their other dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodVBhQmFREAE,Happy with Thai taste here and reasonable price.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajltbEpREAE,"My wife and I stumbled across this beautiful restaurant as we were shopping at QV market. The restaurant is friendly and service is quick and attentive without being in your face. We had the crispy pork belly tapas and the chicken Massaman curry . The pork belly was perfectly cooked with a juicy crunch and melted in my mouth. TheMassaman curry was perfectly seasoned and left me wanting more, We are looking forward to returning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoal9IRF9BRRAB,"Wow, this little gem is a fantastic find. The setup is so authentic and cool. And the food is mouthwatering good. We ordered a crispy pork belly entree (mind blowingly good) & a chicken massuman curry (they actually used chicken thighs & it makes the dish so much tastier). Will definitely come back for more deliciousness üòã"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocmVpbTB3RRAB,Amazing food and lovely staff! So happy I stumbled across this place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3ZiMkN3EAE,Good vibe Reasonable price food Returned a few times never disappointing
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMF9PaURnEAE,Very nice place. 5 stars for the food and 4 stars for atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCclo3UG93RRAB,"We initially went to Queen Vic Market for the summer night market which we had to abandon as the place was just packed, heaving long cues for food. I was particularly horrified with people carrying food on sticks which can mangle some poor hungry soul‚Äôs eye out.  Anyway, we tried this place which was across the road from Queen Vic. The place was a lot more safer, friendlier, comfortable and no cueing for food. The staffs were friendly, food was generous and well seasoned, but the menu list could do some spruce up as it was tatty.  Anyway, I saw steady trickle of people from the Queen Vic market cross the tram tracks to So Thai. Staffs were very busy that my Tequila sunrise came towards mid of my meal and I have already drank the complementary bottle of water.  Will go back to this place, price reasonable and serving generous."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLUxDTWpRRRAB,It‚Äôs take more than an hour to serve
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaS1fR1l3EAE,"The food itself was excellent, but the service was unacceptably slow: we waited well over an hour for just a couple of dishes. I don't know what was going on, but I could see that we weren't the only group to be frustrated by the delay. To make things worse, the table right next to us (who arrived at the same time as us) somehow received their entrees and mains and almost finished eating their entire meal while we were still waiting for our first and only dishes to arrive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCb3VDdGZREAE,"Great variety of dishes, many meant for smaller sharing portions...   Great concept, good food, good atmosphere"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbTZLSjF3RRAB,"Food tastes good But the services were horrible when we went today Slow and difficult to understand And they charged 14dollars for kids fired rice Literally, rice and eggs, nothing else  All fired rice come under one, described with veggie and protein When we ordered, it only comes eggs, and we asked why it does not come with veggie they said because it was for kids? So children are less than a human or what?  And cash only??"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpalB2SUdBEAE,"Use to go here all the time. Unfortunately the waitresses need replacing, most of the time they don‚Äôt know what they are doing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtczRXWU93EAE,I have been here three times and the food has been fantastic every time.  Unfortunately this is let down by the absolute lack of service.  Not only does it take 15-20min to get your order in but then the wait for your food can be over an hour.  Even when the restaurant is at 1/4 capacity the service and speed is still shocking.  This is bizarre as the norm for Thai restaurants is great service and fast food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdmFia1lBEAE,Thailand feel
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cHAyZUVBEAE,Dishonest.was in victoria market and wanted to claim the offer they said it doesnot work.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjU2eTNRRRAB,Crispy and super flavourful!! And the vegetables were so fresh! Vegan cheese tasted exactly like regular cheese.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHQ3d1hREAE,"Bro the food, straight up made me go into a different world man and the mission is great here, best food man holy moly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN09Qem9RRRAB,"Delicious, well-priced and chilled. I had the lamb and loved it. Now my fav place for a bite in Vic Markets"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeUttQ3FRRRAB,"I got food from these guys utterly having no expectations and was mindblown! We got the garlic chicken+cheese, beef+cheese, and zaatar+cheese manakeesh. Probably took around 10-15 min to prepare but that pita bread was soooo soooo fresh and thin!! Even though garlic chicken with the pickle reminded me of a good shawarma, the zaatar was what reminded me of my childhood!! Uttterly delicious and a must visit!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyX3Rib0xREAE,"The vegan flatbread with a few rogue veggies was $16. I‚Äôm so sorry but travel 5-10 mins on a tram north and experience the exact same thing (or actually way better) for $3-$4 at various amazing Lebanese bakeries that I won‚Äôt mention here. I love love love the concept and premise of this place, but sorry disappointed in reality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOU9tbmNnEAE,"Plenty of vegan options! We had the za'atar manakish with vegan cheese and vegetables, the flavours of which were incredible. Vegan chocolate mousse and baklava was also available besides the savoury food. And they also sold delicious craft kombucha on tap!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcGNuQXFnRRAB,What a great concept - Australia‚Äôs first zero Carbon kitchen. The staff are super friendly and the food was delicious. Definitely recommend to all my friends.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM29LUjFnRRAB,I have previously spent time in the Middle East. atiyah is the only place that takes me back there. They use authentic quality ingredients and the taste and flavour is amazing. Highly Recommend.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanBLNkhBEAE,"Another nice go-to meals when visiting QVM. It's around the accessories sheds & not in the deli sections, where most of the food stalls located. I respect its environmentally friendly business model."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXam9qMzhRRRAB,"What a great facility. Foods great, staff are friendly and quick and easy. Thanks, it filled me up well"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3NxdXRRRRAB,"Took a long time and didn't have much substance for $14. Won't be going back. The 3 guys working there didn't seem to be in a rush and it appeared that everyone was getting a bit tired of waiting. Oh well, maybe it will get better with time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaDYtYTFnRRAB,The food smelled deliocious. I was excited to find rain water sold here. The guy was lovely!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOXMtNUR3EAE,Good Lebanese street food! Za‚Äôatar with veg is a winner!! Zero carbon is another reason you should visit!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdElQbDdRRRAB,It was nice but no lamb in the lamb one
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc2JULTVRRRAB,Delicious food and friendly staff!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcnBLY0pnEAE,"A great place to go and have a delicious and flavourful meal. Add juice, a side dish and a dessert and it has it all. A very green place to eat also. It tick all the boxes and customer service is rock solid. We love to go there! Thanks Atiyah team!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNG9taEpnEAE,Amazing place. They cook the bread fresh in front of you. I had the Zatar wrap with vegetables and cheese. The Zatar had mouthwatering flavours and the vegetables were deliciously crunchy.  It's a pity they're not getting customers because the place has become very difficult to access due to the federation square roadworks.  I'll be going back to try out their dips next time!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M0pyZ2RBEAE,Tasty food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LVBueU53EAE,"Waiting too long for food. Biscoff latte is good,and the sweet martabak is tasty but too much for one person."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eVBYVW1nRRAB,"Honestly, there‚Äôs a new famous fresh martabak shops that just opened, right? I must say that Yoi‚Äôs martabak is so much better, at least for now. Some of the foods from their menu is so so, their porridge needs more toppings (eg: soy sauce quail egg) but their martabak is still the best martabak in Melb cbd ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è A bit pricey tho, even by Melb standards."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0ptdzlRRRAB,Love the food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazVmRVhREAE,"Service and atmosphere are good. Food is average. The squid ink pasta with egg yolk calamari is a bit greasy, but the egg yolk taste is not strong. The egg yolk chips is yum."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWVybTRRRRAB,"The rendang and iga bakar are always good, but we come here for the pandan martabak. Best dessert ever."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWN1dHl3RRAB,"I had the WORST FOOD POISONING ever after eating Yoi's Chicken Geprek Mentai for dinner. The chills, nausea and body aches made me missed out on 2 days of work.  Can't help but to wonder how disgusting was the chicken? We probably wouldn't know as it is all covered with flour and sauces. Definitely will not return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHIzOWZBEAE,"The food is ok, the chicken I had was a bit dry so need to pair with the veggies on the dish. The martabak was a superb dessert, had the nuttela and cheese combo. The atmosphere is pretty chill, you can see people enjoying their time so it kinda affected my thoughts on the place. The service is ok, they just make sure you're ok with the food and if you have any needs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnFPOWZREAE,"Most of the stars are for excellent service by Meli. She was very kind and has excellent customer service skills. The food is amazing, and the chilli crab noodles are always delicious. Their Pandan Murtabak with Nutella and Cheese are to die for."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdlBibVJBEAE,"Never disappoints every single time we come here, from the quality of the dishes, to the amazing customer service! Always leave very happy :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOU0yeXJnRRAB,The food is yummy and satisfy my indonesian palate hehe
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFB5U0RnEAE,"We‚Äôve been here so many times now and just can‚Äôt get enough! There are constantly new dishes to try + the serving robot is sooo cute.  Our favourite dish was (and will always be) the Pandan Martabak with crushed peanuts & oreo. We would describe this dessert as a sweet crumpet with a rich buttery flavour and fluffy texture. There are a variety of fillings available and right now there is the Valentines Day Special ‚Äì a Red Velvent Martabak with strawberries, Nutella and cheese.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWVqWVdnEAE,"We were invited to Yoi and my first experience of an Indonesian restaurant has set the benchmark very high. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but we were blown away. Whilst a casual style eat this family run restaurant had exemplary service and absolutely delicious food.  We were obsessed with the salted egg fries and thoroughly enjoyed the beef rendang, kewtiaw goreng and nasi goreng all of which were extremely flavourful and very generous serves. Exemplary value given the reasonable pricing. Incredibly full we had to try the martabak which is their famous sweet pancake you can stuff with the flavours of your choosing. We went via recommendation of the most popular which is cheese and Nutella. Whilst it sounds like an odd combination it‚Äôs delicious and a must try. Thoroughly recommend  Original review We were gifted a Yoi delivery which was cool as they are one of few city restaurants that seem to offer suburban delivery options. We got to try their new martabak pizza which is an ingenious concept as each slice is a different yummy flavour. I loved the Nutella and m&ms ones best.  We were actually so full from the delicious mains that the dessert was the next days breakfast (and what a fun way to start the day!) and speaking of the mains the teriyaki chicken and beef rendang were super flavoursome and incredibly filling. They certainly impress"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2REY19RRRAB,"Bakmie Goreng Ayam, THIS IS SO TASTY LOVED IT THANK YOU AMAZING SERVICE AS WELL!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXRXeGNBEAE,"Daniyeru's Detailed Review:  Customer Service 5/5 *Very attentive, friendly and professional service from all staff, which is hard to find in establishments. So well done on this part! Water was also very attended to as j as very thirsty this day! (hangover). If you're lucky, you will get a robot to bring out the dish to you! (I was not lucky, got humans. Darn..)  Food 4.5/5 *The croquettes were definitely a 5/5! You must absolutely try these home made savoury croquettes. Simply heaven in a crowuette! *Rendang with Rice was nice! It felt like it was missing something, perhaps extra condiments, egg, chilli on side but it lacked this extra element to it which kept it at a 4/5. Product quality wise though, it was on point. Soft tender beef pieces, but should need a rework on the recipe to achieve that missing punch needed! * *  Value 5/5 *Each main dish was approximately $16. For the friendly service you get, the great tasting menu items, the robot and clean venue, its completely worth it!  Atmosphere 5/5 *Modern, very clean establishment. No faults.  Overall *I would definitely come back as it is an open, very friendly vibed restaurant with cool concepts in place. I will definitely return for the croquettes and try more of their menu!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN01tNTRBRRAB,Delicious food and amazing staff
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDhhSGp3RRAB,"First taste of Indonesian fusion food. I'm thinking my Nasi Bungkus was more traditional, served wrapped in banana leaf with steaming rice, squid rings, red and green chilli, slow cooked beef rendang and silver beet. Really fragrant and a great mix of flavours. It was spicy and built up to be fairly spicy by the end but so good. Squid rings were tender and good bite size pieces. The beef was lovely. And the sauces that seeped into the rice brought the dish together. Well balanced.  The beef satay skewers were yummy. The only dish that was a let down was the fried chicken on rice. It was a good sized piece but was very rich with the mayo, a struggle to finish.  Staff were excellent and very attentive. It was cool when the robot rolled into the table to serve food.  Overall, a great experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDV2a21RRRAB,Good but there was no fries available which was very disappointing. Service 4 stars the girls are great fast but the gentleman at the cashier needs more customer service training I think constantly on the phone and very serious not smiling face makes you feel uncomfortable.whike dinning. Food 4 stars Clean 4 stars But over all good but I won't be going back in a hurry. Thank you . Just some constructive feed back nothing else.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2RQcTFRRRAB,The new mustard taste is really amazing! Super delicious! I ordered a large portion with four friends and it was completely enough to eat! Especially the fried mixed vegetables are super delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXJpN2x3RRAB,Food was delicious. Very crispy and filling. We had the pelicana sauce on the side which added nice flavour to the chicken. Service was friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXVDVVNREAE,The food was DELICIOUS!! will be back again for sure‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURock5xU3VRRRAB,"Solid food, enjoyed the boneless Korean frried chicken, seafood pancake (crispy!) and tofu soup (full of flavour). Oh how could I forget the chicken wings with wasabi powder ü§§"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoakpUcE9BEAE,"We love their fried chicken! Tried the Whole Chicken on Cloud on their hidden menu and it was amazing. Seafood Pancake is a must try, very crispy outside and juicy inside. Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoak1UUW5nRRAB,"Very good, must try the hidden menu fried chicken!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocU92U3R3RRAB,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! Ordered delivery and look what I have found halfway through eating the chickens! It's disgusting! I would leave 0 stars if I could. Horrible!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaU4ycl9RRRAB,Best fried chicken !!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUxUMkl3EAE,Whatever how many reviews They ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è don't careüòí ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Nk5qell3EAE,"The French fries are as thin as potato shreds, and the medium cup of cola is half a cup of ice. I ordered green tea before, and the green tea at his house tastes like boiled water. Dogs don‚Äôt eat without a discount, the same price is far inferior to hungryjacks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd18ySzVBRRAB,"How can a ""fast food restaurant"" take 30 minutes to get together a burger and some fries? Every time. If I'm waiting 30 mins then I expect some gourmet food, not McDonald's garbage. The food is phoned in, the customer service is non-existant, if they're not fast either then what's the point of them anymore?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHNlSDd3RRAB,No items for vegetarians ü§î ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3VyUjRnRRAB,"Always a lovely place for my pickup experiences through the MyMacca's app. A two in one location for McDonalds and McCafe.  Ordering can be done via app, over the counter or with the touch screens. There is a consistent crowd throughout the day but hygeine and service quality is mantained. Staff are always moving and working and the lady who served me was extremely friendly.  Lots of seating places, there's also a second floor accessible via stairs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3NIWGl3RRAB,I had ordered iced latte without sugar but they gave me with sugar. The whole place wasn't clean but I think it's always been like this.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN043Ty1nRRAB,Just too expensive for the quality and taste of the food. Why‚Äôs maccas one of the more expensive FF options for the quality  and quantity of the food they serve? Really don‚Äôt get their aim anymore. The gourme Creations option they came out with seemed to be marketing their higher quality food products but these days I honestly find their top tier burgers to not really be that much nicer. Like the meat namely isn‚Äôt anywhere as good as they claim it to be. Beef in particular so I tend to stick to the chicken. Just my opinion. Maybe maccas went through a phase of decency whereas in more recent times it may have lapsed in overall hardiness and quality
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUpUTjN3RRAB,Cheeseburger was dry. Ordered a second one and got given NORMAL ONIONS? I was so confused and it made it so gross.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbThleER3EAE,"Ordered delivery from the app. The eta keeps being pushed back and back until an hour later, I phoned them, only to be told the restaurant never received the order. So now I lost over 40 bucks and according to the lady on the phone, I‚Äôll need to starve because no food will ever come my way. This is a scam!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmZTZDRRRRAB,"Asked for extra onion, pickles and mustard on my burger. Got no onion, no pickles and no mustard.. it was just tomato sauce on a bun"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGMzYkx3EAE,Highly recommended
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScGRYcXNBRRAB,"15 mins for a hamburger and mcbites, at any other store they'd have taken 2-5 mins, even complex orders at peak times are quicker, staff slower than any McDonald's I've ever seen. bites were 1/4 burning hot, 3/4 freezing cold. staff yelling the same stuff like a game of breakout, walking slower than old people, most people waited the same time for me even for coffee. advertising signs outdated. store messy. pigeons around. staff going in and out of manager's office for nothing. insane. not on. even the worst in the uk have been better, total joke for the 2nd store on Elizabeth street of all places when the one for flinders gets needless bad rap? at least your food is quick and workers care compared to this one. not on"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHBEXzNnRRAB,This McDonals has plenty of shaded outdoor seating and tables just off Elizabeth Street.  Great if you need such facility.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3RuX0pnEAE,Is there is halal sandwiches
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNF9UUjBRRRAB,"While waiting in line for my meal today, it took me a second time to hear that it was my order number because of the crowd and this shop assistant's accent. But still wasn't sure because the shop was so noisy. So I asked if it was number 160. He threw my food away and left without waiting for me to finish my question. As a result, the food bag was broken and the food fell out. I don't know if this employee was just rude and uncultured or racist."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUp5d3VBRRAB,More cleaning up needs to happen
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDd5T3dBRRAB,Delicious foods!

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzd0TxAB,"Nice place, food and service. This place represents how good Indonesian cuisines are."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzVuTGxRRRAB,Exceptional Nasi Goreng Ayam. On a cold Melbourne night starting to rain I dropped in for a place to shelter and something to eat to warm me up. It was the best nasi goreng I have ever had. The happy vibrant staff and the authentic surrounds made the night and meal just so good. Recommend 100% for lovers of Indonesian food.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2ZYR2VREAE,This place used to do really good daging kikil balado. They haven't done it in over a year now and have lost my business since üòî will come back if they decide to bring the dish back. ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanJUSDhRRRAB,One of the best Indonesian food i had üëåüëåüëå
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXBQNmFnEAE,Best indonesian food in Melbourne !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOW9Mb2d3RRAB,One my top 3 indonesian in Melbourne!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJODUySHhRRRAB,Iga sapi bakar/ bbq beef ribs is fantastic.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHBmOUFnEAE,"One of the best placed for Indonesian food in Melbourne. Very tasty food. Staff is friendly and courteous. Being vegetarians, we had a few options to select from and the vegetarian nasi goreng and the tempeh /soya stuffed with vegetables was really tasty üåπ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnJTMEV3EAE,Ordered the sambal ijo chicken w rice. Super tasty and spicy. Beware üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXJuWXBnRRAB,"First, try the crispy tempe tofu. Very delicious! It's really tofu and tempeh that taste like spices, the sambal is really Indonesian too. Second, try the lonsay. Just arrived, the smell is really tempting, really smells like lonsay that just finished cooking. Maybe if you add crackers it will be more perfect. Overall, the Indonesian tongue, especially Sumatra, is really approved :')  Drink tea, and it's also delicious. Mbaknya also snappy and friendly. Tbh, I hope to open a branch in Sydney too, even though in Sydney there are already a lot of Indo restaurants too, but this is different, especially the tofu and tempeh. Will be missed and will come again if you visit melb :')"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3JUR0ZREAE,"Lunch on Friday, 21st April 2023: Selamat Hari Raya Aidil Fitri. The Basa Fish Curry is absolutely delicious. Friendly service with a smile. Amazing aroma of Indonesian cooking as you walk in. What a great find. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3QtOUZBEAE,Love the soup meal I ordered.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeklhSjV3RRAB,"Having just returned from Bali/Indonesia after ten days holiday, we really missed the Nasi Goreng. In my opinion the best Nasi Goreng you will find anywhere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeEpUaXh3RRAB,The location very good near Queen victoria's market. And the food just give the justice for indoesian food. It's a must try !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc0xYTGFnEAE,Its very delicious food that i ever had

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGJUQmFREAE,"Delicious, filling, affordable and veg friendly. The tahu tempe rice is one of the best around with perfectly cooked and seasoned tempeh and a nice side of curried soup. The ayam cabe garam is also solid with a good hit of heat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcC1pS3pnRRAB,Awesome food and excellent service from the super nice staff. Been there quite a few times over the last few years and we just absolutely love the place. Keep up the good job guys!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcG9qNXNnRRAB,"Always a great experience! We‚Äôve come here on Christmas Eve for the last few years and have never been disappointed. Staff are very attentive and accommodating, and the food is always tasty! The fresh juice today was great value for money and it was clear that they used quality ingredients!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NUtTZnhRRRAB,"Good breakfast, but don't split bills on the weekend which is pretty poor."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPd2NQQnBRRRAB,Cafe and restaurant of Japser Hotel. Open to public as well to dine in
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXLU12UE9nEAE,Best way of starting my working day in cold Melbourne. Perfect coffee and croissant and friendly and fast service. I was there for an early morning meeting.  Will be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbEliTXlRRRAB,Great experience. Best breakfast at very reasonable price and great quality. The staffs are very friendly and welcoming. Would highly recommend this place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOThXd1ZREAE,"came here for coffee, great place to have your own little private space as its not crowded, and you get the hotel feels and service. have a coffee here and enjoy your time while you watch people pass by and the busy traffic go by you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMk11N1JnEAE,"Went there for breakfast, was really impressed with the food and cost. Suprised it was so quiet on a Saturday, will be going back"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeUpDZXJnRRAB,Special place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaDdHLVdnEAE,"Great staff, good food..thank you!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd2VIaVF3EAE,"Went there with a groupon voucher.  For the quality and service,  wouldn't go if it's full price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNHFxWXpRRRAB,Really great experience - food was just gorgeous and the service was warm and welcoming. Could not fault :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMTRyMzNBRRAB,"The worst crumbed eggplant I have ever had. 4 paper thin slices of eggplant that is probably older that I am covered in a thick chewy doughy ""crumb"" that tastes like chewy sand. Don't ask me how this is possible. $38 200g eye fillet looks more like it's 100g and tastes and feels like a rump steak cut to look like an eye fillet. The beer was the best part of the meal. Absolutely horrible I would give it less than 1 star is possible. Do not pay to come here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbWJheWR3EAE,"Really sad to make this review as I'm the most positive foody usually. Do NOT order the pork belly entree. It's tiny, cold and takes over 30 mins to arrive. Don't be surprised if the 3 tables who arrived after you get their mains before you get your entree'. Steaks were tasty, but my 300g fillet was about 250g (I'm experienced at this) and my partner's was about 200g with a 50g bone. The main issue was wanting to discuss the disappointing entree and lag time of service with the staff. Waitress offered fresh entree and extra wine. Then she said chef refused the fresh entree. We asked to speak to him, but after 20 mins he didn't show. I entered the kitchen to let him know how impressed I was and that there was going to be no payment for the meal. A little professional courtesy goes a long way. I truly hope you have a better experience. I think the waitress was actually on charge!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzOU1lYnhnRRAB,"Nice food and great service, thank you to the Manager today as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeE5ydmN3EAE,Friendly staff and the food was amazing...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNME0teEJnEAE,"Loved the steak there. Well cooked, very tender and delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbjg2RXR3RRAB,"3 stars for customer service, not food/experience: Booked a lunch reservation thru groupon, a day later I receive an email that the reservation had been canceled. I had to call up the venue who told me that they are closed during the christmas holidays (hard to believe - i will be dropping by during my stay to check this). Annoying that I was the one that had to contact them, They should have contacted me first."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbGRPV0tREAE,"Bought a Groupon voucher & redeemed it on Thursday night. Got to wait for more than 45 minutes just for 1 entree. After the entree was served, it took them another 10 minutes to serve us with 2 mains. Extremely disappointing! The food was just okay, nothing special. The restaurant was not packed and there were more than 5 empty tables when we dine. Will not come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUlhallnEAE,"A very quick dinner, had the Sarawak Laksa, it‚Äôs served with Rice noodle, bot my favourite but it‚Äôll do. Usually it‚Äôs come with Rice noodle and hokkien noodle. But the broth was pretty okay, just hopefully they could make it richer. And i had the Gor Loh Mee, which is dried noodle with thin sliced BBQ pork and pork minced, a very simple dish, unfortunately the noodle was over cooked. The flavour did remind me of home."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0tfa2p3RRAB,Delicious Noodle! the plating are good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTdHYXJRRRAB,Always our favorite place to go for When missing home cook kolo mee. Thank you for provided us the taste we are looking for. Perfectly cooked char sew and noodles.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTdHdlBREAE,"Kolo mee special used to be great, but went again last week and now they're using the wrong noodle. Too thin, and ends up dry / tasteless."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWViX0VREAE,"Easy location, Decent selection of different meals."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaktidUJ3EAE,"Went to this place last weekend, ordered the noodle and dumplings. The dumplings is average, but the noodle was horrible . Don‚Äôt understand why this place got good reviews, fairly rate is 2.5."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZNHZQMnR3RRAB,"Good food, kind and friendly staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE5pWTVRRRAB,"Visited here as a born and raised Sarawakian. For the kolo mee and laksa we ordered, they had the close-enough taste but not as 'Sarawak' as you may imagine.  The kolo mee had the genuine taste but the noodle is not what we would usually use for the real kolo mee in Sarawak. The laksa tasted like curry mee for me which was a disappoinment. Real sarawak laksa normally comes with sambal sauce + lime. The soft shell crab was a side and tasted just ok.  We presume the rice dishes taste good. Lots of Malaysian local workers came here for lunch and ordered their rice dishes during our visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmRHWF9nRRAB,Great place with great food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWFUVHZ3RRAB,"Great place to get authentic Malaysian cuisine, had the Sarawak Laksa, soup was excellent and plenty of toppings. Quick tasty lunch and iced coffee for around $20"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2FYSmVnEAE,Very tasty hot food with great portions. Plenty of choices and variety of dishes. The place could use a tidy up. Will visit again for its value for money and good service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2E2YlhREAE,I had vermicelli vegetarian noddles and I came here so many time . I just love these noodles which made me write an appreciations for them if you love spicy amazing option for you. Ofcourse you have better non vegetarian options but being vegetarian I so loved it thanks to the chef who made it because it‚Äôs not there in the menu ‚Ä¶.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSektIdjRnRRAB,"Had laksa with roast pork on Saturday. The pork was very, very salty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXJMVFBREAE,"Food came out very quickly, however one dish took particularly long to arrive. Everyone in the group basically finished theirs before the dish arrived. Seems like they have forgotten about the order, but we did we did remind them twice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobE5XM0NnEAE,Waiting for 40mins and everyone around me end up went to the counter to order instead.  Only one staff and more than 15 tables. Poor the waitress.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNU8zcE53EAE,"Not as good as it used to. A bit too over cook the noodles. Soupy some how, which shouldn't be. A bit sweet, but like the vinegar after taste. Tea not thick enough but polite service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUtUOU5REAE,"Very good, very fast, big meal for cheap. Fried fish laska is amazinggg"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmYyNmpBRRAB,Had a nasi lemak and it was just ok
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWNuaFFBEAE,"We wanted something different from cruise ship food & someone recommended this place.  Great Malaysian cuisine-huge selection, great prices & very delicious!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoN29pV2xnRRAB,"We had Sarawak Laksa, Kolo Mee with a minced pork and soup deal and hot Kopi 'O'. Sarawak Laksa was okay but the Kolo Mee was not good. The noodle was way over cooked and tasteless. I have to add lots of chillies oil and soya sauce to provide a bit of taste. The soup was very gamey to drink for me. The Kopi 'O' was very mild to the point it tasted like coffee flavoured water."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bU5IelVBEAE,all the food is artificial. bad food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOVlUa0RnEAE,I been at this store at 3:30am and ordered for foot long but the guy at this store refused to make my order by saying that he is on break and I threatened him to do the complaint to the owner then this guy made a subway for me and the worst thing is that he always do the same thing with all.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3NHMGtnRRAB,Guy working there was rude and gave the tiniest portions of vegetables
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocVpDMVZREAE,"Ordered a meatball melt with extra meat, but they didn‚Äôt put any extra meatball in it"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMThuNXJnRRAB,I‚Äôve been here a few times late night. They claim to be 24 hr and close at random. I don‚Äôt like the business. Be for the people. Saying we are closed oh oh I‚Äôm tired is not helping anyone. If you have to re stock or need more staff at 3 am then figure that out. That is not our problem. Shame on you
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdV9tSmpnRRAB,One of the best Subway's I've been to in Australia. Everything is clean and proper. Good friendly customer service. The staff are happy to have a good conversation while they make your sub perfect for you. If you want extra pickles or whatever they will look after you. I recommend this place to all Melbourne folks if you want an amazing sub.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaGNDN1NnEAE,"Both the sides of the wrap were just tortilla, No stuffing. I asked for a carry bag and instead the owner (assuming as he was wearing casual and not the uniform and there were four other ladies in the uniform and two customers) was giving advice to carry it in hand. And he was laughing ( making fun of his customer). This is the first and the last time in this subway store. I wish that I had read the reviews before going ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb2N6cGZREAE,worst experince . staff doesnt know how to talk to customers .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbThxX2N3EAE,"Very disappointed with the quality,  Italian bread was not baked well , got a vege patty sub and the patty was stale.  The ambience not up to the mark , absence of customer service,  it like they doing a favour by making a sub . I am sure not to visit this place again,"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURld1lUYTlRRRAB,"Miserable Monday, maybe not but definitely miserable hump day. All I wanted was to walk in and smile like Jared when he picked up his subs on tv, but unfortunately it turned into a emotion like when stuck by investigation. Gabby really needs to entertain herself and find a joyous hobby. Always Miserable, poor,  low energy attitude every time I attend to the shop. Definitely not someone who should be in customer service industry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldnRPamdnRRAB,0/5
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c2NPQU1nEAE,Worst subway experience ever! I ordered for a salad and when i asked to put in the sauce she told that we can put a maximum of 3 sauces! I haven‚Äôt heard such thing! The salad was very dry! Really bad experience!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a0tyR2NBEAE,They forgot half my quesadilla (it‚Äôs meant to be 2pcs) only got 1
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjZHal9RRRAB,During making the sub a girl without mask keep talking to the other staff. It's so disgusting and she made awful sandwich. Never go again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MHNUcm5BRRAB,"Terrible absolutely terrible! Called to see the menu for their best seller, said i have nothing better to do in life!! Saying i pranked called them, even tho.. it wasnt me!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejRxTjJBRRAB,The place is small but the staff members are welcoming and Friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeXF1RVZ3EAE,Why were the choc chip cookies kinda stale at 2pm???
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX2ZQYnJRRRAB,staff are sooo slow and when the manager is there service is way better
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaXNDUnB3RRAB,Average
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOElfZ01BEAE,"Probably one of the best Subway in the Melbourne CBD. Value for money. They give attention to small-small details and always deliver good quality. Every time whenever you visit them, they always exceeded the expectations."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNHFTZ29nRRAB,Nice large subway vegetarian roll
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbEltRnpnRRAB,"Never go to this place, customer service is the terrible, they always have an excuse not to attend you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbl8zQXZnRRAB,Always a pleasure never let down at all
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUpXc0VnEAE,The service is good but not enough high chairs for bubs. Food is good also but need more choice. Milk tea is beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è love it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOV9YZ3hRRRAB,"Although the tomato macaroni soup with beef is amazing, using only lemon heads and tails for the tea only is not acceptable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbVBQVldBEAE,"It tastes good.  It would be even better if the wooden chopsticks could be washed clean, or use glue chopsticks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEt2anR3RRAB,"Came here at 5:30 pm, not much food available. The staff kept telling us we have to spend $10 per person but all the things we want are not available. As a cafe, I expect you to have sufficient bread and at least a few items on your menu. They didn't even have sandwiches. Such a disappointment after reading such good reviews."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNzRXOFZREAE,"The location of the restaurant is a bit hidden, and it is a bit difficult for tourists to find, but the food is delicious and the price is reasonable. It is worth coming. The per capita $15-$20 includes drinks. The tea restaurant is small, and the hygiene is OK. The satay beef is delicious fly! After taking a bite, I want to have another bite. The rich and smooth taste of Ovaltine is the same as what I drank in Hong Kong before. The boss is very generous and the ingredients are generous, and the cider is thickly sliced. The iced lemon tea is perfect, and the tea The concentration is just right, with tea fragrance and a little bit of astringency, but it won't make you sleepless at night.  The summary is that this restaurant has achieved the feeling of going downstairs to eat noodles at night in Hong Kong! definitely recommend"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNkp5MFNREAE,"First-class standard, every time you eat, you will feel like you are back in Hong Kong"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3NTOHRRRRAB,The best HK cafe in Melbourne! üëçüèª highly recommended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeHNEOGFREAE,Delicious and spicy cuisines
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLW9qTkRnEAE,"The food here is amazingly good, even better than the top local cafes in Hong Kong.  The quality far exceeds the price, and there is no weekend surcharge.  A pleasant surprise in Melbourne CBD.  I will come back again and again.  My favourite dishes are the special black pepper stir fried udon, and also the stir fried Ho Fan noodles with beef (without gravy)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocU5uaHBRRRAB,"Seeing that the rating is so high, I went to Victoria Market to try it out. I was very disappointed. The ham and pasta soup base for breakfast was the soup base of the previous one, and it was very salty. I didn‚Äôt ask for white pepper powder, only black pepper was served. The bread with the meal has a sour taste, and the expected hot milk tea has already reduced the sugar for you, which is super sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaGZHcXFBRRAB,This was very good and very authentic.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc3FYVkNREAE,A Hidden GEM of Hong Kong Food in the City... We  loved the Braised stew Beef with radish n the Ying Yang hot drink.. Will definitely come back again to try other dishes....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNTlQMVpBEAE,"Rare but expensive, a bit salty"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cFltdVhBEAE,"Probably one of the best cha chaan teng in Melbourne. While the menu options are limited, each of the items has been made in exceptionally high quality. Love their pineapple bun, hk style french toast and macaroni in tomato soup."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeE0tTDlnRRAB,Yiding Afternoon Tea of ‚Äã‚ÄãYijiushui
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbTRiRnBnRRAB,Ordered the ice lemon tea and black pepper beef fried instant noodles.   Food was served quickly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNWU3MEtBEAE,the hor fun with beef and egg gravy was pre oily but the taste is very authentic and delicious; beef was very tender
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMlliSk9BEAE,"Delicious hk cafe food, generous portion, reasonable price, friendly services."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtX042dmtRRRAB,"This is one of the best meals we've had in Melbourne! Everything was detectable, simple and made you feel warm & fuzzy inside. We had the beef hor fun with gravy, pepper beef ramen, beef brisket claypot and HK French toast. The gravy for the hor fun and the brisket was so good! The french toast has a layer of crunchy peanut butter in the middle, is fried and served with condensed milk and a slab of butter... But it's not sickly sweet! The HK milk tea was strong and not too sweet either. Can't wait to go back to try more dishes! Staff were very friendly and food was quick to come out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck1qTTBnRRAB,"trash restaurant, bad service attitude"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzh6eDFnRRAB,Bad experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2EycXRBRRAB,The waitress was yelling at another table. Also heard yesterday the cook waved a knife at another customerü•≤ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1lXMHRBRRAB,Terribly poor service attitude! The amount is getting smaller and smaller!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1lxODd3RRAB,"Extremely bad dining experience, won‚Äôt order it any more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2NESEF3EAE,trash service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmQtb0RnEAE,"Avoid this place, absolute garbage. Services are so bad, the waiters look like you owe them 1 million bucks. Disgrace the Chinese"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMlBLdmFBEAE,"The old brand can be called a student cafeteria in Melbourne. The salt and pepper chicken steak and green beans minced meat are must-orders!  But now the price has also gone up, the cost performance is also low, and the environment is a bit..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmNleVNBEAE,Bad service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFlyYzNnRRAB,Food is delicious as usual.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2J1akxREAE,"The seller is super rude, the food is not an authentic malaysian roasted meat. Very disappointed üò¢"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMUxXZDRRRRAB,not bad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScG9lN0RBEAE,One of my fav. Chinese restaurant here in melbourne. Tasty and valueable. Good for group and hungry people
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHFtNWhBRRAB,"Delicious food, busy restaurant, fast service, free Chinese tea"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkpYblB3EAE,Great omelette here. Chinese sausage is very good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdU9tbG93RRAB,"The signature no1 dry roast green bean rice is a must! The smell of the pot is very strong. The fried green beans are dry and fragrant. Roasted duck and fried chicken are also delicious üòã Warm reminder that the store prohibits outside food! You can't order the noodle house next door even if you sit outside, so pay attention!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTY3MDVBRRAB,"I am not pretty sure why this restaurant has got good rates. It might be cause some loyal/regular customers. Beside one of the staff was rude as I might know because they are really busy, foods quality are even below standard. They don‚Äôt know how hat is spicy means. They put heaps of dry chili flakes next to the food and named it spicy food.  Will never go there again for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd05MR3R3RRAB,"Fast service, consistently good food... What more can you ask for!?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNl9xa0RREAE,"Hands down one of my favourite Asian restaurants. Their unique softly cooked egg omelette with their one of a kind chiffon sauce is pure perfection.  I‚Äôve tried their bbq pork, crispy pork, spicy chicken ribs, roast duck, sichuan spicy chicken, duck fried rice, and I can confidently say they are all amazing.  Food is delicious, serviced quick, well proportioned and the best part is it‚Äôs not too heavy on the bank.  I don‚Äôt live in the city but I‚Äôm always have to travel here as it‚Äôs worth it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzUySXVRRRAB,"A Melbourne classic, can't go wrong here. Portions are on the bigger side."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmRyUGl3RRAB,"Don't expect much from the atmosphere, this is a in and out, typical Chinese restaurant where you are seated pretty close to each other. Had the duck and schezuan chicken. Big portion, fresh and tasty. Came out in around 5 Mins."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVlMYVhREAE,"IMPORTANT: They do not accept card payments for anything below $40. Cash only. If you only have card, there will be a surcharge.  Food is delicious and in huge portions, well worth the price. Served extremely quickly - almost instant actually.  Atmosphere is that of an authentic asian hawker store. The staff ""yell"" at each other across the room but it's just common communication. If you dont understand the language it will sound like they're arguing. They may also come off as rude to customers who are not used to this style of interaction.  Not the best place if you plan on staying to chat after your meal. If time is required, sit outdoors instead of indoors. Everything moves fast and you will feel the pressure of having to leave right after you're done."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGRmaDV3RRAB,"Big portions, fast service. The lady at the counter is really rude!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBczl6SGRBEAE,"2022 - The Hawker Laksa is now $15. Still the best value to be found. *****  2016 - The Quintessential Laksa of Melbourne.  The soup is more fragrant and spicy compared to Laksa King or Chef Legenda, which comes off as more sweet, for a more timid palate.  The Hawker Laksa is why you're here. *****"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzlHVkp3EAE,"Nice food presentation, though average in taste. Cosy environment"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVozZGtBRRAB,Best Laksa in town
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmV5T0ZBEAE,"Don't understand why this place has a lower rating. Best laksa place by far. Portion is unbelievable and the quality is fantastic, every. single. time. Definitely agree with others to come here when hungry bc the portion is unbelievable. Every element is tasty and has a solid spice level. Value for money - no doubt. You won't regret it. Fast service too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWFIWFNREAE,"Good price, great taste"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnVhWlV3EAE,The soup is tasty! We love it but just a bit oily for me.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenVqTGdRRRAB,Great little place in town surrounded by larger places . Serving sizes are great and taste is awesome and super freshly made pretty promptly . Worth another visit to taste other meals on offer.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnZIbHlBRRAB,Best Malaysian Curry Laksa in Melbourne!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNG9iQllnEAE,Great food. The mee pok was absolutely delicious. When back in Melbourne I know where to stop by.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3Z1ZXVRRRAB,nice food with nice serviceÔºÅ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3YzdjlnRRAB,It is rare to see a Malay restaurant. This one tastes good and the price is relatively moderate. You can try it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeE5iZ2l3RRAB,Food was great just don't order if you're a rush as it took ages for the food to come.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeEpMcTl3RRAB,Waited 15 minutes before meal arrived while everyone had eaten their meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajlyQWFREAE,"Found hair on curry laksa that I order, call the restaurant but couldn't reach out"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDgydk5REAE,My favourite laksa in Melbourne. That eggplant is amazing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDd2bS13RRAB,The Best laksa what we ever ate! üíõ absolutelly love it. Fully recommend. Look at it. We had chicken and seefood laksa.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDlqR0xnEAE,BEST LAKSA IN MELBOURNE OMG!!!!!!! So good that I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling after the meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbV9UZGVBEAE,After taking away all chicken and prawns they could not add a bit extra tofu. Very poor customer service!! Never been to a restaurant that doesn't care about service or selling food. I walked out and spend my money somewhere else.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODZuaV93RRAB,Hop in for an amazing lunch for authentic Malaysian dishes. Try to avoid peak 12.30 daily. Best time is 11.30 to 12.30 to find a seat else you'll have to queue up.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzhXWjJ3RRAB,"Worst Nasi lemak I ever had, nothing is right in this dish. There is no coconut flavor at all in coconut rice, and it‚Äôs actually also the worst steam rice I ever had, both texture and taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWEtellnEAE,"This restaurant used to be good where I went often when I wanted some Malaysian treats but not anymore after today. Service is average, always closed early and ran out of certain dishes or drinks.  I loved the nasi lemak here but it is getting worse every time I went. Today the coconut rice has no coconut taste at all plus everything was cold. I only saw most of the customers having curry laksa which makes the only dish is acceptable?  Won't go back and not recommend because Melbourne has many better Malaysian restaurant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMFlyanBnRRAB,One of my favorite places that serves laksa! Never disappointed ü§© the taste always same since the first time I had it. Always order the beef laksa and teh tarek! That‚Äôs the best one! Well done laksa house! ‚ú®
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnBQdnlRRRAB,"Whilst the restaurant is cramped & crazy, the noise also bad the food cancels any negatives  great meal at a good price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbG91ZFFnEAE,"Haven't had it in a while and was really disappointed today. As soon as the plane returned to Melbourne in the morning, I made a special trip to wait for it to open for breakfast. My friend and I went in as soon as the door opened with our large and small luggage. The waiter arranged a seat for two people. Since we were carrying luggage, I asked for a seat for four people. Unexpectedly, the waiter told me that it would take three to four people to sit. I said that it was just opened and there was no one. Why can't people sit? She said: There will be a lot of people waiting. I was speechless, and wanted to say that if there were not many seats left during the meal, of course I would not have such a request, but it just opened (11am) and there were only three of us and another bachelor. Later, we were given a four-seater seat, but we were already in a bad mood. Later, I ordered a curry laksa and nasi lemak, I believe I will not eat it again. While the curry laksa was ok, the eggplant was obviously overcooked (blackened). The nasi lemak was really not good at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU1TSEl3EAE,Really good food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLU1QYTZRRRAB,"Good food, however the hair colored cashier ruined my mood of having food. I saw most of low rank reviews all point to her, why still keep her to working here.  Fire her"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUpXWVpnEAE,"Must eat gyu tan don! If you like spicy, ask for more chilli and add chilli oil. Price hopefully stop increasing ü§£"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0lfMzJ3RRAB,"delicious Gyutandon, but it's getting expensive nowadays"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdl8yMjd3RRAB,"Bought takeaway of a katsudon, curry katsudon and gyoza. The food is not bad and portion is large."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdF9xeTdBRRAB,Gyu tan don for life
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazgyTmtBRRAB,"First off brings the wrong order when  the order looks more or less the same as the variant. Only egg on top.  Then they have the audacity to ask ""do you know your order"" with such a rude attitude and try to guilt trip the customer? And WHAT are we SUPPOSED TO DO? Spit the food back in bowl so you can serve it to someone else???  The whole lot of you should learn how to talk properly first. Then let alone your incompetent waiters who can't read orders or tables. I don't understand why you guys even work.  Food is good and chefs are good. I respect your cooking But I suggest you change everyone who works at the front.  ""Sorry we were very busy"" in the end server sats you had the audacity to come and yell at us when you were busy.  How dare you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2JXRHZRRRAB,"First time trying soft shell crab, the taste of ramen is not that wow like having in Japan. But the soft shell was very delicious üëçüèª . I recommended you to try."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd01QdTJRRRAB,Very rude customer service. The owner yelling at people and mess up the order without apology. Kick people out of the restaurant and saying they don‚Äôt want to do your business.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2NEbkxREAE,"Staff are very friendly, quality of food is good, price is even better, service was maybe a little too good, I went to order more food and my table was cleaned before I got back.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXJYN2V3EAE,"ordered the food through the QR code on the table and for 15 mins I was being seen as invisible, no water and food (even a pre-made side dish) served and when I asked them for a refund, the bad attitude was so obvious. Funny enough, they almost bow to the non-Asian looking customers, such a racist."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEtPV3dnRRAB,"The Food is good. Depending on your budget, it's affordable. There are plenty of options to choose from. The place I very small, therefore there is not much room to move around, so always wear something comfortable and don't carry many things, cause you'll have no room to put them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEtIWjlnRRAB,"This was a few months ago. Ordered and saw a cockroach on the floor, asked the lady to come pick it up and she swept it away with a broom. No worries. My food came and something looked very suspicious, I thought it was chilli flakes but my friend turned it upside down and it was a dead cockroach. It‚Äôs either the place is so infested tht I‚Äôm getting it on my table and food or they killed it and put in my soup. Have not been back since then."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDZMYXVBRRAB,"Place was packed with people but managed to find seats, when to pick out what to eat. Some of the veggies were not fresh and abit browning.  Door was always open so the cold wind breezed in as we were eating, which was a downside cause we wanted to feel warm"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMFppOWZnEAE,"Private hot pot, inherited a hundred years of craftsmanship, the deliciousness comes from the authentic taste of the soup. Boil fresh big bones for 12 hours, add more than 20 kinds of spices and medicinal materials, and cook a golden and fragrant soup base. Optional ingredients, spiciness and numbness, it is a bowl of Mala Tang! (This text comes from the introduction of the official website)  field visit Take your own vegetables and meat in the basin The minimum consumption is 400g, and the price is calculated by weighing Slightly spicy will not be very spicy, but very fragrant!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjhhRTh3RRAB,DO NOT ORDER DRAGON HOT. I always eat spicy food so i always order the spiciest. Dragon hot is basically hell fire. Tasty but burns your stomach. Still good. Very busy so take it easy on the staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWN5eUN3EAE,The hot and sour soup is not bad! The price is also affordable
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2JlWFpBEAE,The place is a bit small. But the food taste is really good. Their signature malatang is ecommended üëåüèΩ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLU5HLWl3RRAB,"Paid $40+ to feed one person. I understand ordering through Uber Eats would cost more but $40+ for the portion we received was too much.  Don‚Äôt get how they still rate 4.7 in Uber Eats when the portion size is so small. If we had went to the restaurant we could‚Äôve gotten 2 big bowls for $60+, but with delivery we received just a big takeaway sized bowl. Not to mention the 40 mins food prep"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMXFMZThBRRAB,"Terrible service! Without any explanation when my order is done already but don‚Äôt give me (just leave on there when I came to ask ), even someone have got their order through come after me for dine in !

Why should I must pay about 10% extra surcharge! ?Why!???"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoN1A3cG1RRRAB,Tofu and noodles were mouldy and were given attitude and denied mould presence by staff with it very clearly visible. Partner vomited three times later on.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCczZmWFpREAE,"Came here because my partner was craving it.  This is probably one of the dirtiest DHP I've been to, unfortunately it was the only one that's opened.  There were so many flies in the food area, as you approach each section with the tongs, you can see them fly around.  I guess when you cook it in the broth, all the bacteria dies lol.  I wouldn't come here again though,"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNnRiZkNREAE,"We were wanting a quick meal and something warm for the rainy weather. This branch is a little small with indoor and outdoor seating area, however as it was raining, the indoor area was packed when we got there.  The ingredients selection have a good range of vegetables, meat, noodles, and seafood options, although they aren't filled up. We picked some of our favourite hot pot ingredients and took it to the counter to be weighted and select our soup. We got the signature ma la tang in mild. It took some time for it to come out as it was busy, but was worth the wait. We dug straight away into the bowl of delicious and flavoursome broth."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ3B2WDhnRRAB,I got uncooked or bad quality food very time I takeaway and it also cost me more than 50mins just to wait outside. It is obvious that they prefer to served the dine in customers which is sad for ppl who takeaway‚Ä¶

The service was excellent, so I left my bag in this restaurant, and in the morning when i came to the resto to ask abt my bag, this waiter/cook was very helpful, and they keep it so i can get my bag back. His name is Tikki i guess? ( sorry of i'm wrong)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbklmdDh3RRAB,"the quantity is getting less and less and price increases, quality remains.  like i used to pay $14ish for one karage don, and now i m paying $18ish, wth thats a significant amount of increment in price yeah? Yet your portion getting lesser, the rice is so less and chicken still okay still the same. But in general, the portion has always been small, like $18ish for the chicken and minimal rice, and the egg is like not even a whole egg but half an egg‚Ä¶ yet giving so much cheap stuff like beansprouts , spring onions and raddish which is typically useless"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSXzVqcFlnEAE,Really enjoyed the tonkotsu ramen but the takoyaki were kinda stale.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzhQQ2NREAE,"Exquisite Ramen, I went for the Pork Chasu with chicken broth. The you can tell the broth is homemade, not too salty, and heaps of umami flavour. Noodles were great, pork was delicious. One of the nicest Ramen Ive had. Also had crab cakes and octopus karagi which were good, like 4 / 5 ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjdPVk5BEAE,"Not our first time here. The QR table ordering is rubbish and lazy. Although the ramen is good. Didn‚Äôt have chicken karage after we ordered it. Received two ramens instead of one, was not offered a refund nor given a refund. The shop was a mess, water on the floor where we were sitting. Then at 440 am both my wife and I were up with diarrhoea. Hence the time stamp on this post. Looks like the place is closing down. Down from 3 stars to one. Won‚Äôt be coming back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMHNmWVJREAE,Great place. It was an awesome experience. The staff were really friendly and kind.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXBXRl9BRRAB,"Daniyeru's Detailed Review:  Customer Service 5/5 *Greeted politely by waitress. Not authentic like when you are in Japan where they welcome all customers with a Irrashaimase! But in Australian standards, good enough!  Food 3/5 *Truffle Pork Ramen: Was very average and it was about $25. I can't comment much for this as even Instant packet ramen had more flavour. Let alone the extremely steep price. Real ramen like in Japan is 400% cheaper, fresher and tastier. I wouldn't recommend and just go elsewhere for a good ramen, not here. Maybe if you are drunk as this place apparently opens 24 hours I think. Might be good when your taste buds have beer goggles on. * * *  Value 2/5 *$25 for a truffle ramen was completely not worth it when compared to the taste (or more like lack of taste)  Atmosphere 5/5 *Judt like in Japan, counter style and Japanese theme. I do really like the set up here though! Good for dates/mates  Overall *Would come here for a drinking / casual date, but would not come here for a culinary experience. Definitely not! But would be cool for a date as they have strong 196 cans."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXRqWHFBRRAB,The black truffle ramen wasn't as good as I expected after reading the reviews but it wasn't bad. Maybe it wasn't to my taste compared to the other ramen shop I had before ( didn't feel the smell of truffle that much) I think I will be back to try their signature ramen next time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ29pS3FnRRAB,We didn't enjoy the food or dining experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX05fNXZBRRAB,DELICIOUS!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd05YUVhREAE,Amazing ü§©
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZzZ1VHZRRRAB,"A must visit for Ramen lover. The broth is very thick, creamy, tasty and full of flavour. Love both signature and vegan miso ramen. All the sides like Takoyaki and karaage also delicious and cooked perfectly. The downside is the restaurant is small and have very tight space."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoamZUN0JnEAE,Wow. A mouse crawled over my foot. I told the staff. No apologies or acknowledgement. Yes it was late at night but the service was not great. Ok I understand. But the food wasn‚Äôt that great neither. Overly stiff ramen in salty broth. Overall not a good experience. Avoid at all cost. There are plenty of great ramen places around. Mr Ramen San for example.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWVDWTFnRRAB,"Would‚Äôve given 5 stars but my son had severe allergy hours after we had dinner at home. Lucky it wasn‚Äôt life threatening for him but it was still not a pleasant experience.  He ordered the Signature Ramen with pork, he didn‚Äôt finish it so had leftovers to take home.  Today we tasted his ramen and can clearly tell the broth has prawn or crayfish as ingredients. I believe this is what triggered his allergy badly last night.  I just want Parco Ramen to clarify if these ingredients are included in the pork ramen? If so, it needs to be noted clearly on the menu as it could be life threatening for someone with major allergy issues.  I saw there is lobster ramen on your Monee Ponds menu so I am guessing the broth has somehow landed on the Elizabeth store yesterday?  Otherwise, we will come back for more as we really enjoyed the food and the service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmZQMy1BRRAB,"Me and my friends eat here for the dinner, we tried the dons and it tastes very bad, the pickles are disgusting and the meat are hard like rocks. Further more, my friends says this place is one of my ex‚Äôs favourite so definitely will give it a 0.5/10 ü§Æ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNlpPeGNBEAE,Food very bad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc2VHSUVREAE,"Good ramen, served quickly by friendly staff at a good price. Although still tasty, I expected a cloudy, creamy broth and more fillings.  I was surprised that the old signage was still outside if the business name changed, so I expected some of my old faves on the menu on this visit seeing the old sign."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M05YQkpnEAE,"Tried this hand pulled noodle, biang biang noodle with beef. The noodle bit too chewy but the beef was very tender. I also order ox tongue that come out cold. Both very tasty but bit too salty and I will enjoy the ox tongue more if it's warm. Staff very helpful and efficient. Will come back to try other menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eklfVE1REAE,Great place for a quick bite.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUlmNXpBRRAB,"if i only i could give zero stars...the beef noodle we ordered came soggy and the beef is just dry and tasteless. as for the spicy lamb noodle, it was just downright inedible. The lamb is so tough and flavourless, just spicy with no seasoning. The total bill was 43 dollars and i have to say, its the worst noodle place we have ever tasted in our life."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMTRHUkNnEAE,"Peak time has a 5-10 minute line up, but only have 2 staffs. I feel bad for them as they have to do all the job when the place is congested. I was told to just wait for a table to finish and come sit in, then the staff will come and clean them.  The noodles is fresh, but the topping and snacks are too salty. Feel like for the fish they just used canned fish. Too oily as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDRITXhBRRAB,"i can verify this is traditional Xi'an food restaurant, I'm from Xi'an, Rou jia mo and pao mo that i had is similar with my hometown style."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2Jtd1BnEAE,"Good handmade noodles and delicious cumin beef pastry.  Place is small and busy, so you may have to wait to find a table to eat it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaGRXQVRnEAE,great food and normal service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXBTdk1nEAE,Great value for money noodles
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXBHUHZRRRAB,There are many better options in Melbourne than this place. The noodles are tasteless and too soft and the sauce tastes powdery.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTk3NGNREAE,both my friend and i got sick after eating at this place. my friend got a stomachache and i ended up with food poisoning.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWF6NHZ3RRAB,Great cheap eat in melb
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGRPT2tBRRAB,The taste is good enough and the noodles are delicious. I will eat it again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM3NtQjNRRRAB,"Their food is good and halal. However, limited space to sit and eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdW8tcEVnEAE,Took 25 mins for a bowl of take away noodles to be ready and not during peak hours.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc3FuNEpnEAE,"I am not an expert in asian cuisines but the dish I had in Biang!Biang! which was noodles, egg and tomato was so tasety. I heard people I had lunch with to have liked their dish as well.  I just wondered why their noodles are not stringy and more like sheets. Overall, good, healthy and diverse range of noodles, which also include vegetarians."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHEtbVhBEAE,"Waited like 30mins for this. (Granted it was in peak hour). I‚Äôd avoid coming here during peak dinner time  Pretty mediocre, I‚Äôd rather have master Lanzhou and spare myself the 30mins the wait.  No chilli oil or any condiments are on the table."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHN1bFJREAE,The best noodles ü§åüèΩ
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNHVlbmZREAE,So yummy to have a bowl of noodles and a beer after the Sauna feeling so excited to eat them. Well priced and very tasty üôÇ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSektTMF9nRRAB,I ordered the cappuccino which taste very awful ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æthe ratio of foam is way too much‚òïÔ∏èthe temperature of this coffee even worst. I barely asked for warm.  Totally waste my money on it üí∞
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU5TUGdRRRAB,I attended a small function (22 People) on March 24. The room was at the top of the stairs. The acoustics were terrible. Every word bounced off every wall. Impossible to understand people across the table or next to me. Avoid this room if looking for a quiet night. Food was good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSME5tbXhBRRAB,Fun spot!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDgtdHJ3RRAB,Boy howdy they can make a good Dark Rum and Coke
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTlUNFFBEAE,Sensational cheese burger goes great with an ice cold hawkers üëå
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX09MRllREAE,"Sadly the attention of the waiter was very bad, we received a beer with a hair and we complained about this with him and he only said 'I dont serve the drinks', he did not even say ""Sorry"", only the Supervisor of the bar said ""Sorry guys"". Definitly we wont come back here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaDlfRWt3RRAB,Very cool
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcHBQQ0VnEAE,"A pub that‚Äôs comfortable being a pub. And thats nice.  Sensible sized meal, a parma that isn‚Äôt massive. Good portion size but not too much.  Focus on quality and a nice meal. Also round plate, normal serving, normal friendly service.  Very good to go for a beer and a meal with no gimmicks attached.  Good food and pretty well priced.  Large selection of beers as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM0pQWG5BRRAB,nice cocktail and fun night
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCekpEY05BEAE,"What an amazing venue. We organised our End of Year party for 80 employees. I truly hope to have another function here. Every aspect of this place is simply beautiful and historic. The food was amazing, prepared fresh, and the service was even better but nothing beats the place's ambiance. Our attendee feedback included the feel and look of Captain Melville, plenty of food, the food's quality, and the staff's friendliness. Thank you Team"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCakptMTlBRRAB,"Booked Captain Melvilles for a family Christmas lunch on a Saturday. I had put in my booking request that we were taking my elderly grandmother with us, and they did everything to make sure she had the easiest table to access (even called me to let me know about a side entrance)  The customer service on the day was incredible, the chef even threw in some free appetisers for us (we were a group of 13). Staff were super friendly and food was great. Would 10/10 recommend going here for any occasion!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdFBiMUx3EAE,"I had the best espresso martini from Sammy! Fast and attentive service. Great venue, the dining room was beautiful. Thank you! Will be back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaEpEclRnEAE,"Food was served quickly, quality was good and staff very helpful. Courtyard is very pleasant"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDhQdm9BRRAB,"One of favorite places and visited more frequently prior pandemic...I wanted to give better rating if only*******  Cause of my previous response, our office decided to book the place and I absolutely seconded the thought and we got it through. Excited to share the same experience with my office team, we went there on 09/12/22 and we had my office team there from approx 2-4 pm......  One thing that I love the most there is the service and atmosphere, which is spot on, friendly staff, accommodate requests, absolute essence of hospitality can be seen from the time you interact with staff there.....  But the massive opportunity for improvement comes with FOOD.....in particularly Korean fried chicken burger.... Quality good, choice of ingredients good as well.... however portion control is so high that I literally was hungry after having this chicken burger along with handful of chips...... Understand the rising prices for ingredients but so has the menu items also getting dearer, which I'm okay to pay with but atleast don't have such a tight hand on size of meals that your patrons after having couple of drinks and burger with chips still go out hungry spending $50++ .  Can I please suggest the head chef and management to start acting on the feedback as the intent of this review is to see them doing better, back on the same way Pre-Covid as review of similar nature is popping up again and again , must have meaning.... Cheers"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbmZIQm9RRRAB,"great service, menu and food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOGZQLXd3RRAB,"I hosted a going away lunch here this week for a group of 11 people, and they did a fabulous job of providing quick friendly service, excellent food, and even took a few pictures of the group. The dining room out back is a hidden gem, and many of my guests said they would be back again soon. Thanks to everyone at Captain Melville!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQta2VhM2lRRRAB,Amazing food and absolutely fantastic service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbHZxa3N3RRAB,Called in here for our last stop on a walking tour of Melbourne. Was a great pub with ice cold beer on tap.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbXNTNm1nRRAB,A $20 processed chicken burger. Bruh..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNnBUd1dBEAE,"Wonderful venue, outstanding service and beautiful decor! I run History of Drinking tours in Melbourne and my guests are always impressed! Kudos to the team!üòä ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc1B2UXJBRRAB,Fabulous food and great service. Loved it so much we came back 2 nights later. Highly recommended 5*
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd0piemJBEAE,"Amazing atmosphere, service and cooking. The best cr√®me br√ªl√©e and burger I‚Äôve ever had (and that‚Äôs saying something)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtemZDTldnEAE,Great food. Friendly staff. Very enjoyable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtb1l6bTl3RRAB,"Iconic pub. Pleasant staff, good food and reasonable prices. Only complaints are the limited range of red wine and only one steak option."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek9QUWNBEAE,Good selection of sauces to choose from. Unfortunately broth was too salty unless you like pickled lips and shriveled kidneys...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LU1PblFBEAE,"Came to this place because we saw that the same shop in Sydney was very popular so we gave it a try.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. We came in as soon as it opened and it was quiet. When we were leaving, suddenly many customers started to come in.  The restaurant offers many choices so basically you pick your meat, fish balls, vegetables, etc on a bowl.  Go to the cashier and choose your soup base. The staff will weight your bowl and cook the ingredients for you.  Grab your sauce from the sauce area to dip your fish balls, vegie, or meat.  It's a good time to have hotpot now because the weather is cold."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eUs2RlNBEAE,"New store in the CBD and was super crowded. But it all explained, because of the wide range of selections of fresh ingredients and food was served really quick too. The dried stir fry mala was 10/10, and classic bone broth was pretty good too üëåüèª"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSejlpQ3F3RRAB,"Ordered the classic mala soup base, its kinda on the thicker side which i dont prefer.. but selection of the meat, noodles and vegies are great.. service was a bit long, may be bcs it was busy hour just now. Seating was good, not overly tight in between tables"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoejdleUtBEAE,Quite nice. Pretty full but the staff is really helpful about getting you seats. The options are great and the ambience is nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjVibElBEAE,The condiment area is full of small bugs flying around. There are bugs on the sofa and on the plates. The hygienic environment is very poor. There are less variety of food to choose from and the taste is not good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3Zub3pRRRAB,This was a very good meal! So much variety for toppings and bases! The service was quick and the staff were super helpful üòÅüòÅ I loved it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3R5SkdnEAE,"Very rude stuff, asked us to get out of the restaurant even we ordered food there"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoem9mMUh3EAE,"I just bought it and was about to finish it when I realized there was a fly in the soup, I can't believe what I just ate"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekw2X3Z3RRAB,"Very good side dishes and soups. We had a room booked for a big group. Food was great, service was slow at times but they get very busy so it's understandable. Overall a good place for dinner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dVBtdHZnRRAB,"Ordered the beef brisket soup and it comes with rice, costed me $25 and there were only a few thin beef slices in the soup which tasted really, really basic. Would not recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dVBqVjJBRRAB,The food was good it just took a long time to complete all our orders so these are the only ones on the photo. Service needs a little improvement I hope the staff would be a little bit happier doing their job. Thank you
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OFB5WDFnRRAB,Great korean food to share.  Dishes tend to be large and  therefore $$$.  Very tasty food and a big menu!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0liRE53EAE,"This is my favorite restaurant because it's clean. Sometimes the food is different, but it depends on the person doing it... Stir-fried squid I ate at a restaurant was delicious, so I packed it a while ago, but this time it came with soup. Today, the packaging was delivered incorrectly, so I went back and brought it back, but the spoon was not included. It's not a house, it's an office, so I need a spoon. There was a food that was delivered wrong earlier, but is it not served only for me every time? It's not the first time, so I'm leaving it as a review. I used to eat kimchi with my hands."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdl91OXJ3RRAB,Ordered a seafood pancake and traditional pork soup. Both are quite nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSai0tYzJBRRAB,Best korean restaurant! They serve you with many different side dishes. Food really tastes very authentic. This restaurant is recommended by my korean friends. Really must visit!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3BTVlNREAE,everything average. pricey too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnNlRXF3RRAB,"Deceitful image!!! Don‚Äôt fall for it !  What I ordered from the menu VS what they served. When I asked the floor staff to check if kitchen forgot to put the ribs (the picture from the menu has ribs). They responded with ‚Äúit‚Äôs written on the menu, they can look different from the picture, sorry it is written in small print‚Äù  What a joke.  -Astonishingly slow service, took them almost 40mins to serve a soup.  -The floor staffs were very friendly and attentive! I have no complaints against them but the poor business management  - utensils were dirty as shown in the pics  Overall very disappointing experience given the price point as well"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3ZLbmZnEAE,"Had very high expectations. The food is very disappointing:( especially the fried chicken and seafood pancake, very oily and not delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa3ZEM1BnEAE,Great side dishes and everything was delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbE5MOVhBEAE,"Soup is really disappointed. It doesn't taste like anything. And the service is the worst. When you ask the staff for help, they turn a blind eye. And they‚Äôre just clean the table and don't care for the customer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFAyTFBnEAE,Most authentic Korean food in Melbourne! Good because it's not overly seasoned and the banchan (side dishes) is the best so far in all korean restaurants here in Melbourne. Will definitely go back and try other dishes. Good for families as they have large spaces between tables. They also have upstairs space with private rooms for group gatherings.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM19XRFpnEAE,Ordered takeaway to have fish roe should and there were only four roes and bin sprouts for 28 bucks. Quite disappointed
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajVLOHRRRRAB,"Went to celebrate valentines day. Staff very friendly and fast service, dishes nice and hot. Will go back to try more dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTRDZllREAE,"Their soup dishes are amazing. We had the ginseng chicken stew and the spicy fish roe stew, both are rare offerings in korean restaurants. I haven't had better outside of Korea. They were also very generous with their side dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmVhbDhRRRAB,Lots of tasty side dishes and the soups we had were delicious and hearty.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGNHZTd3RRAB,"Lots of side dishes, meals served out out almost lightning speed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdFlqeVF3EAE,"Surasang's food is the best Korean restaurant in Melbourne! The friendly service of the staff is also outstanding! It's a taste that you won't get tired of, no matter how many times you eat it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWNxVG5RRRAB,The bibimbap soup is cold today
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk1pamt3RRAB,I swear this will be your good choice of brunch. I like how the nuts brings the salad up to a new level of taste. The crossaint is crispy and the egg Benedict is amazing.  The dish is an insta photo act too. Good morning starts with good food especially when it is beautiful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eklETVVREAE,Beautiful place üòäüòä ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSejV5bTBBRRAB,Cute cafe but only open on weekends so its quite hard to visit. Food was great and staffs were friendly
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzlMaHd3RRAB,"It's okay to experience once, but it's not particularly impressive. The food is too greasy and not very healthy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmRpX1Z3EAE,"It was quite hard to book a table as we couldn't get hold of anyone and there didn't seem to be online booking. However we were given a table within 15 mins which was great. The food was incredible, not just beautifully presented. The flavour and colour was stunning. One of the best brunches I've ever had. I recommend trying the avocado nuggets which were unique but very nice! Lovely cosy place to play board games also."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemVmYUVREAE,Beautiful presentation of dishes with tasty avos!

Highly recommended cafe!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ3ZUUzVnRRAB,The food and drinks was phenomenal! I will definitely be back and will recommend to friends.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaHBxOUh3EAE,Love the chill vibes in this place with quite the interesting menu. Staff where very attentive to us which was awesome. The place also has multiple boardgames and karaoke rooms to suit your entertainment needs
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdXBmX3l3RRAB,"Came here for breakfast. We ordered the Beet Power - Avocado, beetroot, hummus, cinnamon, almond, cashew, pistachio, pumpkin seed, sour cream on sourdough; and the Chorizon - Avocado, chorizo, cream cheese, onion, coriander on sourdough.  Service was friendly and they were quick to get our orders.  I loved the freshness of the ingredients, but wished that there was more zestiness to the avocado. My partner loved the Chorizon.  They also serve decent coffee."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX0thbWtBRRAB,"Off the beaten path and a little hard to find. I was confused since sign on door says ""Marche"". I guess they change business names for breakfast/dinner. But staff was polite, atmosphere is perfect and I had the best breakfast in weeks!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtN0xLcW1nRRAB,"Very welcoming, just the food takes a little longer(30mins+)  they do let us know~ but it was fine, I enjoyed the moment~"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnBfWUVREAE,"Not recommended! The service attitude is extremely poor, and the food taste is not good üëé! It's not authentic Sichuan cuisine at all, I won't go there again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmZPYzdBRRAB,"Exceeded my expectations, the portion is large, and the dishes I ordered tasted pretty good~"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocnRDWHVnRRAB,"Very bad experience, ordered 1 appetizer, 4 dishes, 1 soup and 4 rices. Served us 1 rice and said they need more time to cook the rice, those remaining serves of rice finally show up when we have finished all dishes and about to leave. Most importantly, they did not update the paper menu (the one used for ticking and choosing) properly, and the manager insist that it is my responsibility to check if the paper menu matches the big menu. Unbelievable. left with disappointment and empty stomach."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN1kyNGhBRRAB,"The portion is so big that it scares the baby. It is super affordable and delicious. I will definitely visit again! But for one person, a packing box is essential! It's really too big!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOGFDU1BnEAE,"You close at ten o'clock, why do you write twelve o'clock?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCamJueXlBRRAB,I went to for lunch by myself and ordered the Malaxiangguo. It was very good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCN28yVlZBEAE,"I came to have dinner with my friends on public holiday, because I know that they usually have a 10% discount on cash checkout. When we finished the checkout, I took the cash. The cashier at the front desk told me that public holiday does not accept cash, so I paid with a card first. , Later, my friend and I were very puzzled. The store explained that it was a public holiday and there was no discount for cash. I think I heard it right when I checked out..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbWV6OUpnEAE,The fat sausage is very fragrant and delicious. The fat is very rich. The wagyu mapo tofu is too salty. I feel like I have eaten a mouthful of salt. It is still too salty to mix two pieces of tofu with a whole bowl of rice. The price is normal
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbVBQU1N3EAE,The spicy hot pot is delicious!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWRIWkVREAE,"Wayyyyy too overpriced, wagyu felt like shoesoles, rice with wagyu had barely any wagyu in it, dumplings were a 4/10 Service is bad and when I asked if I could take away our leftovers I was handed a small plastic container where i was supposed to fill my food in.. with chopsticks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aGNtaV9BRRAB,Lamb was rock solid. Can‚Äôt even chew. Food came after 30 mins. Sadly the overall service was super bad.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N3V6ZjBRRRAB,Meat in the dish doesn‚Äôt taste fresh at all... very disappointing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a05iRDl3RRAB,"A really grand looking restaurant with really good food I would say. Came on a weekday night near their closing time and the server on shift was nice enough to let us dine in. We were the only customer there so it was pretty peaceful and nice to dine in. We ordered Stir fry noodle with chicken and mala dry pot. Both dishes were exceptional! This was the best mala hotpot that I‚Äôve ever had in Melbourne. I‚Äôve tried enough to say that their mala hotpot is perfect for me. Not too spicy, not too numbing and most importantly, not too salty. Price is reasonable as well. You choose your ingredients by ticking off a paper and they‚Äôll send the order tot he kitchen. Not the usual pick up your own ingredients, weight and pay. I gotta say, it‚Äôs more convenient this way. Their ingredients were fresh as well! Will definitely come back for more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cjZ5TnVnRRAB,"After eating it twice, I decided to only come to this place for Sichuan cuisine in the future. The taste is very Chinese, and the portion is very large. There are not a few leaves of boiled beef that are all beef. I think the price is average in the city, after all, a bowl of Vietnamese noodles is only 18. There are very few people at noon, I hope his family will stick to it and not change the taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ODh1OE5BEAE,"I don't recommend it, the taste is not good, and the attitude is not good. There are not many people but there is still a long wait"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ODVQbk1BEAE,"Worst service ever had, waited for over 40 mins and just one cold dish came. No sincere apology. Do not come to dine in, they only care about their take away orders."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ODlPMHV3RRAB,"Extremely terrible experience!!!!!We waiting for almost one hour for the dishes. In terms of the taste, just soso!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3N1ZThBRRAB,"The map says it closes at 3 o'clock? On 2.08, the young lady in the store said that it closes at 3 o'clock and will not pick up customers at 2 o'clock. Then why not say it closes at two o'clock?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnJpcGxRRRAB,"Amazing place for Chinese food.  The place specialise in Sichuan food but also offers many non spicy regular Chinese options.  I personally really enjoyed the kungpow chicken which wasn‚Äôt too spicy. That is what I recommend the most.  Everything else was solid from the pan fried buns, dumplings and beef with wraps."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa01LaEt3EAE,absolutely looooved the food and flavours here!  they do a single hotpot style where you can choose what you want in it.. have it with soup or have it dry these aret actually big so def worth sharing it with someone!  everything i had was absolutely delicious and would love to dine here again!  it is a bit on the pricier end but the value and flavours is worth it!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ3Z6TjlnRRAB,"Sichuan food is one cuisine that is always on my top list whenever I think of a meal to decide on ! We visited Musou a short while ago and It was enjoyable dining with dishes that reminded me of the Chinese food I grew up with. No, I am not from Sichuan, but these dishes had so much similarities to what I was used to!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcU9ULXJBRRAB,"Authentic and delicious Sichuan food @musou_sichuanfood can be found under the roof of @dalongyi.aus  Each and every dish of their menu is bursting with so much flavours, taste and warmth.  What we had:  Stir fried prawn meat with yolk egg and corn Stir fried shredded pork with pancakes Salt and pepper prawn  My god guys, all these three dishes are so mouthwatering and amazing, the quantity is perfect for sharing as well. And also are very fresh at the same time. It was hard to pick a favourite amongst the three as all of them are equally fantastic and delectable in their own way. I can‚Äôt recommend these dishes more to you guys.  Also the prices are very standard and with a grand ambiance of @dalongyi.aus restaurant you are bound to have a great dining time here.  Checkout @musou_sichuanfood @dalongyi.aus for their dishes‚Äô taste, flavours, uniqueness and quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMG8tSVFREAE,King pao chicken. 5 star.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbV9uMDRRRRAB,Value for money and reasonably tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ1lxd1F3EAE,Nice Sicuan food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcG9TTzZnRRAB,Food and service are good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSckpPVHRnRRAB,Very delicious and genuinely just beautiful restaurant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDZmRGlRRRAB,"The last time I came here was three years ago, but now I compare it to two different stores. The tableware, ingredients, and pots have all become cheap tableware. The only thing that remains the same is the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1lfcUxREAE,"Bad customer service, I asked them for cutlery and when they bring them they just throw them on the table without even say a word ‚ÄúSUPER RUDE‚Äù I felt so mistreat and disappointed after having one dinner here. Never go there again. The food wasn‚Äôt good and pricy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ2ZmLVhBEAE,"The staffs are rude and unfriendly. They throw the spoon to customers; and remove the chair while we are sitting without permission. The food decoration is not suitable to the price, look like a cheap and low quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaHJmZkZ3EAE,We called in by chance to this restaurant for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. Food came out quickly and was so delicious. Definitely  recommend the beef spare ribs with crispy chillies! Huge serving with decent hot chillies and perfect steamed rice washed down with a red wine.  Definitely will be back!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMkpyZDFnRRAB,"Chinese hot pot, good for cold weather. The price range is high, but it has a different charm from Maratang. I go often because the location is good, and it's very good to eat with crispy pork and fried rice.  The reason for deducting one star is that there was no customer service such as pouring additional broth. I ate a little salty at the end :-( And when I cleaned the bowls in the empty seat next to me, the sound of the bowls clashing was too loud. I hope they pay more attention to the table."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzaGE3Qm13RRAB,"Dalongyi's red oil pan really lives up to its reputation. It's spicy and enjoyable, and the more you eat it, the more fragrant it is. We ordered medium spicy, and the spiciness is just right. Friends can't eat spicy. The chestnut chicken soup is also delicious. Spicy beef It is also very enjoyable, and the beef yellow throat is also very crispy. 5 stars recommend their crispy meat. We ordered 2 at once, but we still couldn't eat enough. I really recommend everyone to eat it. It is definitely a rare authentic Sichuan hot pot in Melbourne. ü§üü§üü§ü"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNDg3QXVBRRAB,"The service is very speechless, like an unmanned hot pot restaurant. There is no clerk at the door, so I asked someone to go upstairs and downstairs to find it. The drinking straw has no outer packaging, and the waiter directly took it with greasy hands and placed it on the table casually. Everywhere is an eye opener."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOThhSjRnRRAB,"Soup was tasty (we got the spicy and herbal soups) and ingredients were fresh and actually quite unique for a hotpot restaurant.  Would go again occasionally, though it‚Äôs on the more expensive end."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNWJmYW13RRAB,Everything was great. Nothing bad to say. :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOTRpRU9nEAE,Trash!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtODZyQUl3EAE,"Amazing food would definitely recommend coming here to eat, every dish I ordered was soo good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX3NhaEh3EAE,"Good selection for the hot pot, also they took walk in, unless others that only take bookings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtM29tanpRRRAB,"Cold rainy day is the best time to eat hotpot. I happened to try a new hotpot place in the city which highly appreciated in the country of origin, China.  I had two base soups, one is chicken herbal and the other is ox tail tomato soup. Make sure not to forget to order the mantou. Theirs is unbeatable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlck5iYThnRRAB,"I came to Melbourne and wanted to eat hot pot. I passed by this shop and went in. I was so disappointed. At the end of the checkout, there will be an additional 1.5% fee for swiping the card. The experience is overwhelming!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldEtiVE1nEAE,The ingredients are very stale. The base has no other taste except spicy. I went home to the toilet twice to experience it myself
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTZTOWVREAE,"I would definitely give 0 star if there‚Äôs an option. Ruined my night. First time trying this and after eating: definitely the last time eating this. Hair in one of the dishes. We ordered one jar of watermelon juice which costs me $25 but it tastes to me like drinking 85% of tap water, and it caused me and my partner having DIARRHOEA after eating this. High cost but super duper poor service and long waiting time for the dishes to arrive. Definitely a big NO."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNE9mZjhBRRAB,"Ruined my night, I told one of the staffs that it was my first time there and wasn‚Äôt sure on the whole ‚Äúhot pot‚Äù situation worked, he told me to look at the table behind me. Then another staff approached me after and lectured me on how I should order. As someone who works in hospitality, this was just disappointing. Food was gross, the prawns tasted old, the soup tasted like nothing just plain chilly. I couldn‚Äôt even finish my food, wasted $90."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MWJmYlRnEAE,"Port customer service experience, no eye contact, we weren't even met with a host at the entrance stood there for 5 minutes before I decided to go into the restaurant and find a employee/wait staff to show us to our tables. wait staff seemed awfully distracted and they weren't busy with other customers during our visit (approx 3 other tables) they just seemed as rushing to get their jobs done by providing the bare minimum efforts with customer interactions and service food quality was below average photos taken of the menu/food appear better that they taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek1ERWZREAE,Lovely place‚Ä¶ we had a Chicken burger and a chicken wrap it was amazing and superb presentation ‚Ä¶.üòòwe will surely have it again.. ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUpqSkNREAE,Great place with great vibes
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bVBQNExnEAE,"I was staying at a nearby hotel and unpleasantly surprised their bar was closed after 5pm, so as luck would have it, sprung upon this casual yet comfortable bar.  Meals were typical pub grub (good value and incl vegetarian option).  This spot was a great place for a Thursday night catch up with my daughter.  And of course I couldn't walk past the old tabletop arcade machines for a nostalgic step back in time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHV5UDVnRRAB,Nice place for chilling out with friends. Fries a bit salty but still fine.  Love the guards and staff cause they are nice and so strict with not vaping inside and there was a Chinese customer vaped all the time but when guard came to warn him he pretend to be a dump who can‚Äôt understand EnglishüôÑ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0kzWTF3RRAB,"Atmosphere is great, the snacks are decent as well. Definitely a great bar to go to as a regular hangout spot"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzVlQmV3EAE,"Went for a few beers, feed and footy (NRL). Beers and Schnitzel (super crispy) were solid! Plenty of screens and no NRL üò¢ ‚Ä¶"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGJqV3dBRRAB,Good time with friends
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbm96VldREAE,Worst customer service I have seen in my entire life. P.S I work in hospo
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODh1OFF3EAE,Security are wankors
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobzh6bmF3EAE,Nice place in the cbd to grab a beer late...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZzdlcWJREAE,"My experience was embarrassing and avoidable. As I approached the security entering the SPORTS BAR facility I was denied entry due to my ‚Äúslippers‚Äù. These ‚Äòslippers‚Äô are shoes I have never been denied entry to any club before while wearing them. I wanted to treat my mum to some birthday drinks and this ruined our night. She was allowed to enter with a similar style shoe, however, my shoes were deemed inappropriate for a sports bar. As a business, you might want to put up some reference photos of what is prohibited as it‚Äôs confusing. Please rethink your shoe choice before entering, the seccy is brutal!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN1phcmR3EAE,Great place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGRERjZBRRAB,If I could give 0 stars I would. The security guard was incredibly rude and boarder-line sexist. Spend your money elsewhere.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzYzMENnEAE,"good quality of meat, polite and attentive waitresses, good exhaust system (no smoke despite having indoor bbq!), and good background music. Highly rated for a reason"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN2JySGxBRRAB,"Food was alright, table services were fantastic, staff was super friendly and happy to help."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamFuYVRnEAE,"Really awesome KBBQ with really good prices. Kimchi pancake is best I have had. The set menu/options are really good value but the 8 different flavour pork is not really the best. All the beef is the best, much better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNllDQWpnRRAB,"Review from Singapore - the taste of the food was so-so however, would like to feedback for the good service. Although the waiting time for the staff to serve the food and cook the meat was longer than expected nonetheless, we dropped a plate of meat and the staff kindly replaced it for us without any additional charges. Do note that for the set meals, a small plate of corn & cheese is included. We weren‚Äôt informed and we ordered another plate of it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2NiY2lnRRAB,Service Good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGNmX1BBEAE,"Visit Melbourne so many times and this is the first time I come to this restaurant. LOVE Everything!!!! Vibe, Food, Services."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenNkaxAB,"I tend to have a lot of interest in food, but it seems to have been well improved to suit the tastes of foreigners. Koreans who say it is not tasty are ignorant. This is not Korea."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0tlSEZREAE,Great spot catch up with friends. The army stew way amazing!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWUyV0NREAE,"Joomak is a small hidden gem tucked in the basement of a building in CBD Melbourne. I love the atmosphere and the food were really good! I especially love their chicken gizzard and makgeolli. They serve their makgeolli in bowls and have many flavors such as peach, mango, etc. Has been my regular place whenever I‚Äôm in Melbourne"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHRlSXp3RRAB,I love going to Joomak. It‚Äôs absolutely affordable and tasty.  The chicken giblets here is a must order. The vibe is perfect to have some drinks with your friends. I would definitely recommend to get a booking on weekends as it gets busier.  My favourite Go-to here in Melbourne. I don‚Äôt think anywhere else is as affordable as Joomak is!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnR2RFR3EAE,"We arrived at 11:57, and the staff was ready to go home. Why close so early when it say that opened until 1am on google? Maybe change the time when you want to go so early!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGY2NEpREAE,"Service and staff are appalling (more specifically, the short, chubby non-Korean woman)! We walked in with an hour and a half until closing (still time for food) and saw two booths free; however, we were told that they would not seat my party of two. After having to wait and then be able to ask why, the waiter still said a flat no and it would be 30mins to an hour wait with no hesitation. They were not accomodating nor friendly and simply refused to help. There was such a lack of customer service that it has turned me off Joomak for good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGQ2RG13RRAB,Walked in with 1.5hrs to go. We didn't even acknowledged. Had to wave the short chubby non Korean lady down before. 3 booths opened up as we came in. She said they were for 4 or more people. Just said she wouldn't seat us. I asked if they were expecting exactly 4 people in the next 1.5hrs. Rather than accept 2 people who were hungry and willing to pay. Got turned away. Blatenly didn't care and zero customer service. With all the hype I've heard about this. This was my first and last experience with you. I'll take my money to the much better rated Korean places in town thanks
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXFPbnhBRRAB,The food is nice and the rice wine is amazing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLTR1eUlBEAE,We went this far but the kitchen was closed at 11 not 1.. waste of time and efforts
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaWZXa2R3EAE,"The best peach rice wine in Melbourneüçë Hide in the basement! Great atmosphere with box seats The portion of the meal is smaller than the Korean food outside, but the taste is very good Fried chicken, pancakes, peach wine, tofu soup must order"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNXRyZlNnEAE,"Nostalgic place, still the same as the past. Good place for light food and drinks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNzltX193RRAB,It is located underground. It takes us a while to find out the location. The food is okay. The environment is nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOGNUOGtBRRAB,"The kimhci pork stew is good, but japchae could be better. Service is excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2VTTFR3EAE,"Been coming here for years, a great cozy place for drinks and supper"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeHNyX3V3RRAB,"Situated at the basement level means there is no direct signage on the street front. You need to pay attention to the number and address of this place in order to find it! Unfortunately it is stairs leading down to the basement and I did not notice any lifts to access. I like the option of sitting in a booth (comfortably sit 4, a big squished with 6). The service is very fast and the quality of food was really good. I recommend getting the peach and mango blended ice sojus. The cheese tobiko egg roll is also excellent. Not much street parking out front (as usual) so you'd need to park further away like Leicester St or buy parking at the nearby Secure Parking or Wilson Parking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcDcyMmdBRRAB,"So amazing, Joomak has been on my list for a while now and I‚Äôm so glad I finally went. We had the kimchi pancake, LA ribs, rice wine, lychee rice wine, soup and egg rolls + rice and the total was $142.  Good portions and more than enough for 3 people, and staff were super polite! Definitely book beforehand to make sure you have a table."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd19XX0V3EAE,Always a good spot for good k-food in the city! Remember to always call up or make a booking before heading there as it can get real busy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLXRESi13RRAB,"A waiter wearing glasses has a very bad service attitude. Just because we asked once where can we seat after waiting for ten minutes , he said you asked so many time, just get out. Unbelievable"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa29xb2lRRRAB,Service sucks but environment and food is good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN19uQVN3EAE,Cozy diner with great service

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaE02ZTZBRRAB,I love the food üòã ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLVBfZ3N3RRAB,Great little dive restaurant. You would never know it was there unless you know where it is. Food is okay. Told me they didn‚Äôt have my favourite spicy chicken feet stew and 2 minutes later the table next to us that arrived 10 minutes later got the dish I wanted. Wasn‚Äôt really happy. Good for late night eats though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbmFDRkd3EAE,Located underground it‚Äôs best to reserve a table prior. Very decent food and good price for it. Average staff service and it‚Äôs not exactly comfortable seatings
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NFBiZEdREAE,The food is soooo good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSelpyZHpnRRAB,"Tried Vegan garden goodness and sweet potato chips. Both are amazing. Especially the patty, too good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWJPdE5BEAE,"$28.00 for Waygu burger, chips, kambuca and tomato sauce. Its mince paddy. Their menu changed, I really liked when they used to make, actually steak burgers.  Way to expensive, for mince paddy, I thought I was getting actual steak, won't be coming back unfortunately. Rather go to a pub and get a real steak burger and pay the same price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkxpa3VBRRAB,"Food was excellent, presentation of food was excellent but service was not it. Working in hospitals isn‚Äôt easy but body language means everything. Service could be better by checking in on customers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGQzLVpBEAE,"Never tried such a special burger, a real BBQ burger that reminds me of a campfireüî• ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2VQNFVnEAE,"excellent customer service, food was fresh and tasty, really good quality"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHRmX2l3RRAB,Couldn‚Äôt order food at 22:30 pm ‚Ä¶ while they are open till 23:00
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMnJfcXN3RRAB,"The host team at this Grill'd restaurant in Melbourne Central is just awesome. The host lady on the night made me feel very comfortable and very welcomed. I went in to have dinner. I ordered a zen chick burger and sweet potato chips. Both were very well prepared and tasted marvellous. The battery on my phone was running flat. When I asked the host lady for a power point, she nicely offered to move me at a table close to a set of powerpoints. I managed to keep my phone alive for my trip on the train going back home. So i would like to say a special thank to the host lady on the night. Thank you also to the Grill'd team for bringing up such great healthy food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocnJEOHl3RRAB,Best Grill'd I've been to
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMW9QNFhREAE,"Great place, great food, staff are very helpful and patient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNDdiTUhBEAE,By far the best Grill'd burger I have ever tasted. I didn't want bread so I chose ceaser salad with a beef burger instead of chicken. It was divine!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX0szUTBRRRAB,"We figured we would go to a fave and unfortunately 15 min after we arrived a giant school group came in. The food was great, as always... However the noise was insane. Absolutely insane. Its not the staffs fault at all but I seriously wish I had been warned before we ordered as we would have gone elsewhere. The staff had set tables aside and brought out bins of burgers obviously ready for the school so they knew there would be dozens of children screaming the night away. Seriously disappointed we wasted our night out listening to that."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcHZQd21nRRAB,The staff were courteous. The baa baa burger and Sweet potato chips were delicious. I must admit the patty was not as fresh as the Southbank and Moonee Ponds outlets.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCXzhtTVp3EAE,Grill'd is always good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMV92UnNnRRAB,Not given but good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMGVfV2V3EAE,"So delicious !!! A special thx for Krishna , Annie  and all the crew"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOHJiMGpnRRAB,"Great food and service, venue is a bit dark but that's  just a personal preference"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM2FLeC1RRRAB,I drew a samurai eating a burger. Good chicken nugget. :)))))
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdW9LalBnEAE,Terrible experience with the worst pho and bad packaging. I ended up eating my side & roll without sauce.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeXV1VXZ3RRAB,Thanks for a great dinner and friendly service! My 10 yr old just told me its the best burger hes ever had  üòä ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd0pmX0VBEAE,"Great big location in Melbourne Central. Good food, including plant-based burgers.  They provide monthly donations for ""Local Matters"". Great to support local matters and community.  Friendly and capable staff members.  Thank you for your service and kindness!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtby12N0NBEAE,"Great spot to eat, staff were ok but could improve their communication skills. They were hard to hear due to music being loud and their accent/elocution,  no offence. They forgot the table water too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNGZUMWFnEAE,Tastes like it has been eaten before.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteHZTZ3NBRRAB,First time ordering takeout from here today. Very tasty burger and fries with mayo. Easy to order online. The girl at the front counter had great service and an amazing smile
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dklxb1lBEAE,"Great selection of meats and side dishes, great vibe and great customer service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek43UG9BRRAB,Satisfying and good quality kbbq buffet. The only complaint is the booths they have for big groups are too small and inconvenient to get in and out. Other than that it is a good place for dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NU9EYW53RRAB,Delicious and worth your money and amazing food and prices
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUwtbXF3RRAB,"Enjoyable experience, friendly staff, good food. Reasonable prices. Definitely worth trying if you haven‚Äôt ever been to this style of restaurant where you good your own food and it is all you can eat. Will for sure be going back in the future!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTRpSVJBEAE,"I called to confirmed the halal twice. They said it halal and maintain halal, check review and it mention halal so yeah give it a try. made a booking, and they gave us balcony area whereby I have 4 years old kids and when I request to change the place or do something as it was raining last night, they staff were disgusting. They don't believe is and speak in their language like we were not there. But I insisted cause they have like 3 indoor table empty. Talked to another staff and she went outside to check if it was raining üòñ it's literally raining! Then again they speak in the language and looked at us like we were criminal. Lots of food but sadly to find out pork and other meat were in the same place and use a same thong."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzZXSGxRRRAB,"Great value of money for a good AYCE Asian buffet. Wide range of selection (there‚Äôs even sushi, oden bar, soup, desserts etc.), prawns were super fresh and hot food was really good too üî• ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemNiNGl3RRAB,"all you can eat BBQ buffet located in the centre of Melb !  around $45 pp, offers a wide range of dishes to choose from and staff were also super accommodating.  great spot for large groups, very spacious and lovely atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUtyaHBBRRAB,Good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNTZESzlBRRAB,Busy atmosphere but adds a flare to a night out with friends. The meat quality is good. Would have a higher rating if the sauces had a kick to it but that's just my personal preference.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaG9MYjhnRRAB,Excellent selection of meets and comfortable seats. Has deserts but a bit dry. They are strict with their time slots so come at least 10min before your booking.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScktIaXBnRRAB,"Incredible value for $45 all you can eat (and cook) for 2 hours. Great selection of meats, salads and other things such as honey chicken, spring rolls etc. great experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbU1MMXh3RRAB,"Worst place I have ever been, service was rubbish, food was rubbish and staff were not interested in helping, meat was all frozen and on top of that I was charged more than their advertised price, when I questioned it I was told that‚Äôs the old price"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGFpZnJRRRAB,"If you are a Korean, it is not for you. Cuts are not for kbbq. Side dishes do have some cumin flavouring. It is definitely not Korean authentic but it is not a bad place if you are not really looking for any authentic taste. Also the ""wagyu"" is definitely not wagyu. They should really remove it before lawsuit jumps in."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmZ2N2ZBEAE,Great foods ü•∞
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobGVfMElnEAE,"Food is very good. There's re cooked food ready, and against the wall, there's fridges with fresh seafood and fresh meat that you can cook on the stove on the table."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobG9XR013EAE,Amazing place with huge selection for both bbq your own or ready cooked food. Good customer service proactively check our grill plate and change when it get sticky.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXRDYkt3EAE,"Great Korean BBQ joint, lots of variety in meat, vegetables and dessert items. Great friendly staff too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaTZlWFNBEAE,"Fairly priced, great food and service. Only thing lacking was ventilation, each table or each sections of tables needed a range hood to remove any smoke or smokey smells.  Also salt and pepper on the tables is a must, also some garlic salt would be a plus. Overall good experience and would go again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoODRfdHFRRRAB,"Went to the restaurant on a weekend,  by the time we get to the restaurant, all the hot food was already fill to the top. I was impressed, the first thing i can see was the small mountain of the fried chicken. Staff great us nicely and because we had a change with our booking, they have no issue with that and we get to set down straight away. The food from this place was amazing, the verity of meat for the BBQ was impressive, beef, pork, chicken and even seafood. Beef with beautiful marble, thick cut pork belly, you name it. Overall we had a very pleasant experience, if im not on a diet, ill definitely go back to have more. Hope this restaurant can maintain its stander and keep it this way."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNkliRVBnEAE,Got food poisoning. The meat that they were serving was old. Everything was tasteless or old. Worst dining experience ever.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMDVMdkRBEAE,"Staff were really friendly! All you can eat wagyu, plus other tasty meats. Cheaper than most kbbq places, and tastes pretty much the same (but all you can eat!). Definitely coming back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcFlUVUpBEAE,"The Korean-style corned beef has a sour taste. After eating it, I had diarrhea at night and went to the emergency room. I have already complained to the council....."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE1QMzlBRRAB,You gotta love this place.....great for vegetarians and vegans.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1l2MElnEAE,"Came to Melbourne for the weekend for an event, I went here on the first day and I ended up eating almost every meal here because it was so good!!! The panna cotta and butter ‚Äúchicken‚Äù were my favourite. I‚Äôm not vegan but I would be if I could eat every here every day"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTZyZk5BEAE,I came here after seeing Marywave's review of the restaurant. I have to say I am in love with it. Just as in the video.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzdLd0dREAE,"Very good prices with super kind employees, the food was delicious and all vegan! I‚Äôll definitely be coming back would completely recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWRmNDh3RRAB,Very good food even though its vegan and a very neat and clean place to eat with very good prices for the buffet.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHBxNjV3RRAB,Delicious food and the most friendly staff around.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVpHMVVnEAE,Great food options and tasty ! Always gets top up so fast! Great value for money üëå
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFktSWJBEAE,Everything is just awesome about it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFpicEx3EAE,Amazing!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanBHSGxnRRAB,Love this place. The staff are great and the vibes are fantastic.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOW9iaHJBRRAB,"Huge variety of vegan buffet food for decent price, great atmosphere and lovely staff!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHZ6NzNBRRAB,"We had lunch here. Lovely, clean and comfy place to relax and dine. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was delicious! Wish I took photos. When we walked in, I was very excited to see a buffet display bursting with an array of vegan food (plus desserts!). We paid $19 each for all you can eat. We went back for seconds as we hadn't had breakfast. They provide biodegradable containers to take home whatever you can't finish, to reduce waste. We finished off our leftovers in the hotel room the next day. Yummy!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXNxdjJBRRAB,"I love the concept of this restaurant but I was astonished at the low quality of the food. First I had the potato salad, which was actually delicious, but literally every bite I had after that (And I tried most of the options), was substandard food that I could probably improve on myself with little to no practice.  The basil pesto pasta in particular was one of the worst things I've tasted from a restaruant recently, it tasted like pasta with water and cream sauce."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnFtU1h3EAE,"The food is delicious, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. It's a must to pay them a visit next time you are in Melbourne! üå±üå∑üíö"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnJIOUl3EAE,"Vegie Tribe is a gem hidden in plain sight. Located in the CBD, Vegie Tribe offers a great value buffet menu. The food is delicious, catering for various tastes, with Asian, Indian, and European dishes available. The staff are very friendly and welcoming (though there is no table service). The decor is warm and inviting, and nice place to hang out for a coffee, glass of sparkling or cocktail."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHNlSDNBRRAB,The food is good and very tasty. Everyone should try once. It is a pure vegan restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHFDOGxBRRAB,"Loved it. Food was ultra tasty, with great variety. Nice ambience, super cool spot. It does get busy, so maybe book a table."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSakkyaGR3EAE,Vegan buffet with a wide variety of dishes. Low quality of food and I find it quite expensive for the price. 28$ for all you can eat wich honestly is not bad. 21 $ for just one relatively small plate. Kinda force you to take the all you can eat I guess. The atmosphere is nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEoyb1JREAE,I have been to this restaurant with my family and I had the worst meal experience. I am from hospitality industry since many years and my expectations were high. Not at all value for money for the dinner buffet price which was 28 dollars per person. No water refilled. Food was completely cold and not good specially the vegan butter chicken and palak paneer. Food wasn‚Äôt fresh at all and seemed spoiled. No replenishment for the pizzas. We had to ask for water every time. Rude staff and bad customer service. Very disappointed and would never ever recommend this place. Please don‚Äôt waste your money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk9mVkxREAE,"I visited this place on Sunday afternoon with friends. It is vegan buffet with unlimited quantity. I tried most of the available food options. Bread pakora, butter chicken, deserts, pizza, salad I liked the most. Palak paneer and lasagna just disappointed me. Overall we loved the food and place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUpDQUlnEAE,"Good service, absolutely delicious food, well priced and so good to be able to eat anything as it's entirely vegan!! Will definitely be back....soon!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MlAyWkhREAE,üëç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajlLeTlnRRAB,"Good value especially when sharing, otherwise good for one person if you want to try variety.  Nice noodles and soup bases."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMC1fU2Z3EAE,"Probably the worst restaurant in town. Hygiene is a big problem. You literally have to kill flys/bugs during your dining, but a few of them still managed to dive in to your soup. Disgusting and would never go back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOVlfYllBEAE,"The noodles are pitifully small, $17.8, although the bowl is big, but it‚Äôs not enough to eat at all... The taste is so-so... It‚Äôs still Tianfu!"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMFpCaRAB,I ate here 3-5 times a week when they started just before COVID-19 and all the lockdowns. It is still my favourite place for lunch now after 3 years. My favourite ones are mixed mushroom rice noodles and seafood combination on pumpkin soup.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHJhallBEAE,"Best dumplings in the city, even better service! Always willing to accommodate. Wouldn't go anywhere else!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMHZQNkhnEAE,Rice noodles with beef slices taste good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNjluOHdnRRAB,"Such good hotpot, the noodles are simply delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCb0lPTGFBEAE,"came here after a theater and it was 11pm. glad that this place still opened for business at the late hours. didn't expect their noodle soup to be that good. the noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup were delicious. they offer a great variety of soup, from non spicy pumpkin seafood or pork broth to different level of spicy hot soup. the staff were all very friendly considering its late and they could be tired from the whole day working. we enjoyed our meal and will certainly be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbjZfc2dnRRAB,"It's uncommon for a restaurant to have it's food match it's name - Boss. Yes, the Rice Noodle with Signature Hot&Spicy Broth with Tender Beef ($16.80) was just that, a boss. As stated in the menu, it was spicy, enough to make my face sweat, while the flavour was just right. The quantity was great for the price and there were sufficient beef pieces and tofu as well. I wish there was a little more bok choy, but that's just me nitpicking. The noodle soup was served in a beautiful bowl. The staff were courteous and friendly, and the place was quite clean. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will be visiting this place again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMHVEU3pBRRAB,Really good value and generous portions. Clean restaurant and food came out super quickly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlam9HdVRREAE,Tender beef with pickled chilli Rice Noodle Soup was superb.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHJEaVVnEAE,Good tasty food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OTZxUmtBRRAB,"I normally buy a chicken and prawns dumpling from them and they cook it freshly for me but today the guys just took it from the trays in front of the shop, also it was a pork and chive which I didn't order. Dumpling was dry out and it's not what I ordered. I'm so disappointed üò≠üò≠üò≠"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MC12RHl3RRAB,The more people the more affordable rice noodle shop You can also try the single-player challenge BMW Pot
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1N0xuUzl3RRAB,"The first Chinese meal in Melbourne, it's not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Nklia0x3EAE,"The pickled cabbage in the pickled fish rice noodles is really pitiful, about three thin leaves... The fish is pangasius, not Chinese freshwater fish fillets. When I go in winter, there is no heating in the store, and my legs feel cold."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cU1fNkx3EAE,The chicken and prawn dumplings are the best in the Melbourne cbd and we eat tons of dumplings. You can get addicted to them. They had steamed egg there once. Pity they didn't do it again. Their mushroom hotpot is nice and generous with toppings.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdnVHb0ZBEAE,Yummy is delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeV9YRXB3RRAB,Really good dumplings! Good job
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLWJLazF3RRAB,"These rice noodles are cooked perfectly, nice bite. Spicy soup on point"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNUlycGRnEAE,Amazing Chinese rice noodles! I really love with sour fish rice noodle Best to go to the shop have meal So good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdWRDSmJnEAE,"Ordered Sanxian, tomato and sauerkraut takeaway, all delicious! Personally, I think it is better than Li rice noodles. The packaging is not leaking at all, and the crispy meat and hand-made pork balls are strongly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkp2VDd3RRAB,Very affordable and good serving sizes!! üòÅ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkp1V2d3RRAB,"I ordered the Aburi salmon udon, the teriyaki sauce was good and the udon broth is an umami flavour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekt2UThRRRAB,Good food
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUs0ahAB,Found they newly opened a franchise in CBD yesterday. It‚Äôs so cheap and convenient for people who work nearby. They have so many sauces so go and make your own meal
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOV9XQnFBRRAB,Love the food here!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmMtMnVBRRAB,They have better flavoured sushi rolls that are a bit dear compared to normal but worth it. They also sell their normal omi meals and also bubble tea. The seating is minimal but it does seem more like a takeaway shop. #goodsushi #goodbeef
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmNMcHFnRRAB,Great place to eat at
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVpQZ193RRAB,Excelent chicken catsu. Very fresh and crunchy. Portion size is bigger than most places. Staff is very friendly and helpful. 100% reccomend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVl5UlVREAE,Been fans for ultimate wagyu and pork scotch... try im melbourne central n high point..consistent quality

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXBMZ0ZBEAE,"Great sushi, some complex flavours to try when you bored of the standard sushi flavours"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXBpQ2V3EAE,"It's good food, I would recommend this store very. Much"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXBpV3h3RRAB,really yummy!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXJmUDVRRRAB,Amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHVmT3pRRRAB,Best udon in Melbourne cbd
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHVleUtREAE,10/10 would recommend
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ3JiWnlnRRAB,It‚Äôs delicious
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScUxhWTl3RRAB,Good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc1BEYVNnEAE,Fast service. Truffle fries are the bomb.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ003ZHdRRRAB,Delicious sushi rolls!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTR1YkJBEAE,Lot of options to choose from..really good taste.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDV1YjRnRRAB,Delicious noodles and lovely fries
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTdYb3BBRRAB,"Great food, great experience, matcha brulee is tasty!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUwyZTdnRRAB,"Finally my old love is back! I have been going to Yamato since I was a student at Melbourne University. However I didn't go there for some years since start working f/t away from the central CBD area. It is great to see it back near my office, and the food quality as well as the presentation is still as good as the way it was. ‚ù§Ô∏è I invited 3 friends to come along, we thoroughly enjoyed the food, the beautiful tea and the atmosphere. I look forward to the sake (liquor licence pending) and the return of bento boxes (hopefully!)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMVlEc3d3RRAB,"40 minutes waiting for food and it wasn‚Äôt even busy, no complementaries for the long wait, will not return"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMy1yOXFRRRAB,"The quality of the food.. I just laugh. In the end, I came out and felt different. Thinking about it makes me angry again.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa09qRVlREAE,"Good homemade and authentic taste, a bit pricy for the quantity however it is understandable due to COVID and costs of running a small business in the CBD."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdjhTVFlnEAE,"This place has a good atmosphere but sadly the staff and food let this place down. One star because our salmon sashimi had a bone and my daughter had to eat a lot of rice to swallow the unagi bone. When I told the staff about the bone, she just smiled and said sorry about that. She was too busy to bother. There was only one staff serving the entire restaurant, long wait despite we wrote our own order and handed to the waitress. We left hungry despite paying $110 for 3, we didn‚Äôt bother to order more and went to the shanghai restaurant next door. My brother felt bad for taking me here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMnI3dXV3RRAB,"The best Japanese rest in Mebourne. The food so good, its worth it even sometimes we need to wait a long line."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeU9DLXB3RRAB,"I love this place, it's small and cozy full of knick knacks, feels like you're in Japan when you're in here. The food is delicious, the price is great. It gets busy so I try to go early"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxd091Z0hBEAE,"Like the decor reminds me of trips to Japan, let down by staff who do not want to be there, turning customers away way before specified closing time, and the mixing of sake into one bottle was a bit rich and the food was okay would I go back, not really."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMi0tYV9BRRAB,"Nice atmosphere, quick customer service and quick food. Although the menu says there are izakaya days and normal menu days, they weren't doing skewers at the time, so I was told.  Miso was good, eel was alright, tempura was alright and mochi seems nice actually."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLamZLcjZBRRAB,"I arrived at 8:25pm and when I reached the front of the queue with my partner at 9:30pm the staff came out and, realizing people behind us had one more person in their group, admitted them and left us standing at the front. She might have said ""sorry, we will serve you next"" but they didn't communicate with us. It was a cold night and to be waiting at the front knowing the restaurant will close in an hour and see the people behind you be admitted was a little frustrating. When we were admitted we were in a rush to order and eat, I was seated near the kitchen and at one point the staff walked out and dropped a plate on my shirt onto the floor, it wasn't a smash and she was fine, but I had to check my shirt for spills and she didn't say ""sorry"" or ""excuse me"". This type of thing almost never bothers me but it stood out because I was on edge about the service.  Despite the poor service the food and drinks were fantastic. An explanation of the small serving sizes would have helped as I only had one order but the tori no tatsutaage and umeshu cocktails in particular were delicious. It had an authentic izakaya feel and comfortable atmosphere but better service is definitely needed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMWVycXZnRRAB,"Authentic foods with authentic settings!  Tried to visit this place about a year or two ago but was closed. This time, came across this place again and decided to give it a try.  We came here around 5pm and the tables started to fill up. The place isn't that big so I suggest to come early otherwise you may have to queue.  We ordered their banquet no.3 and the foods were very delicious. There were 8 courses including the appetizers, main, and desserts.  The salmon sashimi was very fresh and the nabe soup was very memorable! They put the chicken balls and the taste was like dumpling fillings.  The set was very good choice especially during cold weather. It warmed up or body and soul.  Will definitely come back next time to try other dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcFpHcFNnEAE,Tasty & authentic
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMllQdG5BRRAB,Such a lovely little restaurant to dine in. I love the food and I love the cute Japanese decoration. I felt like as if I was in Japan.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNm9ual9BRRAB,LOVED their indoor and outdoor decorations. The screen on top of the wall that plays random music videos makes that little corner in the laneway so Tokyo.  LOVED their yuzu umeshu and katsu nabeyaki.  LOVED how fairly priced this place was.  It was a busy Friday night. I think we lined up outside for at least 40 minutes to finally get a table. The staff must be exhausted. Tables after tables to serves. I guess that was why the staff didn't seem friendly at that point of time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbE92U0xBEAE,Adorable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc09tSHFBRRAB,"Good atmosphere, slow service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc1BIdUd3EAE,"Had one of the most disappointing dining experiences here. Our sashimi was not necessarily fresh as it has a slight fishy smell to it and the soup served in the udon dishes lacked depth. Be sure to also wait 15 mins for your drink order and about 40 mins for food. There are definitely better japanese ‚ÄòIzakaya‚Äô type places in the city. It was definitely way better 5 years ago, pity the standard has dropped."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNF9XWjVRRRAB,Terrible service terrible food small portions very expensive
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNDdtcEhnEAE,Food is great according to friends. Be prepared to wait for up to 30 minutes if you arrive late (8-9pm) and tortured by the smell of tempura ;)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWFXUjhBRRAB,"I used to come often, but not anymore! Saw the most disturbing thing today üò≥ I don't understand how there can be a restaurant offering waxing on a table next to food and drinks and messy clothes on top of the bench!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN2VIQ3R3RRAB,"The food is very good, but on days when you have events, like last Saturday, consider having a limit of people. It was very uncomfortable that one could not enjoy the party, could not dance, because of the number of people."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobjg2Y3F3RRAB,"Brought my family here on a cold Tuesday, we had the hotpot and noodles which are perfect for cold weather. Flavor and portion of food were great. Service was the best in the Chinese resaurants I went recently."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMmFEc1l3EAE,"Dine in and spent ~$150 for 2 adults. We came here because of good review in google review and the pictures are appealing. First thing first, you have to use QR code to order food. Scan in using the QR code, only realise the menu is in Chinese ONLY! so for those who knows no mandarin, its impossible to order anything. My partner know no mandarin, he gave up and I placed the order (thankfully I know mandarin) Secondly, we would like to order the hot pot meal set for 2... viewing the hot pot meal set menu, All SOLD OUT! Nevermind, we came here, and tea already served,so we ordered the soup base and meat separately.  End up ordered a soup base, 3 types of beef and marinated prawns(raw). The verdict- the meat offered not great. The sliced beef is very grainy and chewy, the brisket is very tough. The soup base came with few slices of corn is tasty , but we are thirsty after wards. Then for the sauces, have to pay $3 per head.  summarizing my thoughts: The soup is good but it should be good given that its $39 with few slices of corn and daikon and meat balls. raw marinated prawn- first time trying it. acquire taste, not my cup  of tea but its ok . $29 for 8 prawns the meat - below average - given i spent ~$70. I am expecting better than average. The service- they are attentive and at least when I asked for their assistance, they are trying their best to assist. But, if you are are non Chinese speaker or literate, its going to be so hard to even navigate the menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaklmSHhnRRAB,"This is an interesting place. I was a bit late, as they close at 3 PM and reopen at 5, so I was curtly reminded by the receptionist about it. Nonetheless, I ordered a bowl of Beef Rice Noodle Soup ($21), which arrived soon. For the price, the quantity was very good, but I wasn't entirely satisfied. It was somewhere between a Chinese beef noodle soup and Vietnamese pho. The flavour was kinda uneven, and I could smell something a little sour, from the excessive veggies or soup, I can't say for sure. The beef wasn't bad but mediocre  The place is well lit, simple and clean. Plus, you can take some candies from the reception.  Not recommended in my opinion."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGVxVzFRRRAB,"Visit #1 I came across this place today and I'm glad that I did. A wide variety of dishes with varying but (hopefully) justifiable prices. I ordered duck meat fried rice. I didn't expect to receive such a large quantity. It looked delicious and tasted even more so. The place was clean and the ambiance was calm. The lady at the reception was kind. It's a hidden gem in the city. A must visit!  Visit #2 Had a plate of beef and onion dumplings ($11.80) while my friend ordered a plate of duck meat fried noodles ($13.80). Delicious on both counts.  Visit#3 Wanting to try some vegetarian, I ordered stir-fried potato, green pepper and eggplant on rice ($12.80). It was so much better than I had anticipated! I can't recommend this enough!  Visit #4 Simple and hearty beef brisket noodle soup ($15.80)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZy1LWGZnEAE,Very good to go when you are in a longing of bice place plus cozy ambience and attentive waiter/waitress.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbEplMXZRRRAB,We ordered chicken and prawn dumpling and 2 servings of xiao long bao. Waited more than 30mins and when the food arrived most of the xiao long bao are busted  and no soup inside.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdHVXb09BEAE,Went in to eat lunch around 1:30 waited 30mins still no food. Had to cancel the order and get my money back as my lunch break was over. Seems they just continue to take delivery orders and not care about dine in. Will never go back.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPakxHVFd3EAE,"Hidden Jem on exhibition street! Such a charming, warm atmosphere, we stumbled upon it and wandered in, from the outside it was dark and didnt look open but upon close inspection, we saw a warm and inviting little home like place to eat. The food was Amazing and authentic, the staff so genuine and generous, the menu extensive, the prices so cheap!!! You really have to come and try it for yourself. Not just dumplings, but authentic cuisine. Will be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaWJiVkRnEAE,"I went to have dinner when I was very tired walking in CBD.  The food is tasty, reasonable price.  And they don‚Äôt charge bank fees if paid by the card, which is nice considering most small Asian restaurants do so."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbGZhQXd3RRAB,I just love the pan fried vegeterian dumplings from this shop. The only dish I ever had here. My second best in Melbourne. I'm a happy customer going back any chance I get.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX0pGYxAB,The dumplings skin is very thick‚Ä¶and the filling is just little
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaGRqT0hBEAE,Grandmas dumplings is my favourite Chinese restaurant ever. I travel 40 minutes into Melbourne just to have there delicious lemon chicken and garlic broccoli. Never had a bad experience with their food will be very sad if they ever close down.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOWZQYVhREAE,Wow little gem of a restaurant
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcjZmSVVREAE,"Even after placing order via call, they took 30mins to give the food.  On top of that very unhygienic service, the person at the reception sweeping floor and handling food at the same time without even washing hands after sweeping.  Very disappointed, won‚Äôt be coming again and will not recommend anyone to visit this place"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcU56TUJnEAE,BEST CHINESE EVER.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdk5ENlJ3EAE,"Just had delivered by Menulog which took a long time, but hey, it's lunchtime in the city, so understandable. Had fried pork and prawn dumplings which were legit! Proper chunks of prawn, well seasoned pork, definitely hand made! The fried rice also was super generous with the ingredients, not just loads of rice with half a prawn and a slice of lapcheung. Will definitely order from here again or make a visit! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcTV6aVpREAE,"Small shop but great food, highly recommended. Had especially fried rice and pan-fried pork dumpling ü•ü ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeWNYWWtRRRAB,"Love this place. Wide range of dumplings, both steamed/boiled and pan-fried. They used to have a lunch special that included a free can of soft-drink. Wasn't advertised yesterday when we went, so think it's gone. Noodle and rice dishes as well, beers and soft drink."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cjVmc0RREAE,Great dumplings ($10.80 for 15 pretty large ones) and noodles ($11.50 for beef). Portions are bigger than average and have lots of meat and vegetables. One of the cheapest places for both in the CBD without compromising too much of the quality of the food. Only downside is that it's further away than most other places.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X3RLZlV3EAE,"Nice dumplings, had a steamed and fried to share with a mate. Pretty reasonable price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScThYM3NBRRAB,"Went here for a dessert stop on a Tuesday evening at about 8pm, was nice and quiet with no waiting.  Warm and cosy atmosphere with limited dessert options but is easily made up in taste.  Highly recommend the green tea pudding!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSblBIRktREAE,"Without a doubt the best sushi train I've been to! Incredibly fresh seafood, amazing flavours and lots of really great options presented on the train... And actually a very well priced meal we had! Just all around a fabulous experience! The bullet train delivery of 'menu' dishes was a really nice surprise, but we were sitting too close to the kitchen, so didn't get that option. Do yourself a favour though and have a great lunch here... You won't be disappointed! The photo here doesn't do any justice..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHNUZXh3RRAB,"Best sushi I‚Äôve had in Australia so far. Fish was very fresh. My favourite is the squid, crunchy and sweet! Staff were very nice, they always check on you. Seating was very comfortable and very clean."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHNySU1nEAE,"TLDR: Go to the one across of Emporium instead of this one. Horrible staff attitude.  Long story: Waited 20 min in line and got to the front just to be told ""we don't have table for one, sorry"" and they turned me away. Staff then went and asked the next party in line ""for how many people?"". So I asked to clarify ""you don't have seats for one person?"" And they told me they only have booths for 4. (The party behind don't have everyone ready yet). I told them I'm only gonna take 15 min. A counter seating then opened up (lucky I waited). While I was having my meal they were talking about me in Japanese to each other right behind me on why I was so mad. Well to answer you: I was turned away for waiting in line for 20 min without being ask to wait for a counter seat to open. Don't talk about your customer in Japanese literally behind them assuming they won't understand. Quality was better in the other branch anyway."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3JHQnZBRRAB,Extremely tasty and cheap sushi train in the Melbourne CBD. Staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is great.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc3RuMXZBRRAB,"You have only ONE HOUR to be here.  You can‚Äôt move or change the table. DONT bring your friends or family here.  It‚Äôs good for one or two people, hungry and happy to pay overpriced sushi.  NO BOOKING accept. Grumpy customer services."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0tUM0dBEAE,I have been supporting Sakura Kaiten for a few years. First time coming to this store. The only outstanding is BAD customer service and the attitude of the staffs. We do pay for the food and not supposed to be served like that. Never come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0lTbENREAE,Food was good but customer service just ruined the whole experience. Racist and discriminating attitude towards me and my friends as we're Asian students. Will never come back

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWRhSUN3EAE,Very small and intimate sushi train with separate seating available. We got seated at a table and ordered sushi from the online menu. The sushi ranged from 4 to 8 dollars. My favourite was the salmon belly nigiri. Everything was quite fresh and delicious. And it came out very fast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNGNIdHJnRRAB,"Food was good. But I had a terrible customer service experience. One of front house staff was so rude and bad attitude. Overall, I won't recommend this place to anyone else"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUk3Q0R3EAE,"Cute diner vibes, bottomless batch brew and a fantastic breakfast muffin! The place was busy when I visited with my elderly parents, but the staff were attentive, accomodating and helpful with finding us a booth because a bench seat was not practical for mum and dad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzQyeThRRRAB,A special dinner experience at Melbourne CBD. Tostie with one of the best coffees in Melbourne.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjZ6ektnEAE,"Found hair when finishing my last bite- short black hair; suited to the cooks. Me and my companion both have light coloured long hair. Food was alright, hair was placed on the side of the plate for better view"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdF9iTWdRRRAB,Great food at a reasonable price!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDlMak9BEAE,"A cosy diner that serves up all-day breakfast, coffee and sandwiches. They‚Äôve got your classic pancakes, breakfast muffins as well as specialty sandwiches. It was so good that we actually visited twice in one week because we wanted to experience their breakfast and lunch.  The breakfast muffin was top notch. It was like a fancier maccas muffin but 100x better. The cheese toastie was the best cheese toastie I have ever had. It paired so well with the tomato dipping sauce. The pancakes were so light, buttery fluffy! Especially with that pecan butter!  For lunch, you gotta try their sandwiches. I‚Äôm a huge tuna melt gal and saw there was a not tuna melt and had to try it. The salmon in it was amazing! The deli sandwich was so fresh and kinda reminded me of a banh mi. The bread for me though was on the harder side and ruined the insides of my mouth. The hot dawg with the thai sausage was shockingly good and surprising! It was like a thai curry stuffed in a sauce and it was balanced with the sauerkraut BUT the sausage to bread ratio was really off. There was too much bread for my liking and not enough sausage."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDY3MWRnEAE,I‚Äôve been thinking about this sausage muffin and caesar salad for WEEKS ü§© outrageously good and like no other!!! The thick slices of bacon are devilish!! üòà
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDR1REJBEAE,"Great atmosphere- music was on point. Great tasting food- Pancakes were fluffy, bacon was Crispy. Burger was moist and the curry sauce was was flavourful. Enjoyed my time here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMlpIOVRBEAE,Puts a 12% surcharge on the payments and calls it Tax. ILLEGAL!!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHRmd1VREAE,"We checked out Melbourne's new American Diner! This new diner style cafe is by the cafe by the Operator25 team, serving all-day breakfast, coffees and sangas.  The must orders: loaded brekkie muffins, syrupy fluffy butter pancake stacks, coffee in the classic diner mugs and diner milkshakes  Classic US Diner, retro-inspired addition to Wesley Place just off Lonsdale street.  We got: ‚ô° Katsu Kick ‚ô° Not a Tuna Melt ‚ô° Julius Caesar ‚ô° Usual Suspect ‚ô° Latte @codeblackcoffee ‚ô° Mocha ‚ô° Iced Tea ‚ô° Milo Milkshake"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVBDNnVRRRAB,"This is the spot. Bottomless coffee, pancakes, booth space. A place for plots with your close knit friends and 4th wall consciousness breaks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjhLTE93EAE,"So good!!! Amazing diner vibes, friendly staff, great food and fast service! Would definitely come back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNl9ycWVREAE,"Nice little America style diner. The restaurant is quite spacious and offers a quite a few tables, it‚Äôs opens bright and refreshing. I liked the food and it was tasty, nothing amazing but I would definitely return. The prices  is pretty affordable. 7.5/10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczlfMlBREAE,Lovely brunch place in the CBD. Met up with my friend from interstate here. Conveniently located off Lonsdale st. Food and coffee were yummy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzcyZ3JBRRAB,Excellent food and will be back. Usually these aesthetically pleasing new cafes are a bit gimmicky but the food was great. The English muffin was so fresh and fluffy and all the ingredients seemed fresh and homemade. The burger was good with a fluffy bun. The pancakes were good but not the best.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzZHcjJnRRAB,"The location is great, just near the library, it's a good choice to take a break after studying and have a cup of coffee (I noticed that they use great coffee beans!!). Because it is located in an alley, there is a lot less noise from the city. This store adopts American retro preppy style with red soft decoration, everything looks so cute. My boyfriend and I each ordered oatmeal fruit yogurt and fried chicken burger. The food was mediocre for us (that's probably why I gave it a 3), but otherwise there were almost no faults. If you and your friends want to have a good breakfast time, this is the place to choose!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2UtWDR3RRAB,Left feeling underwhelmed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2ZxQmVBEAE,Well sorted breakfast dinner next to Wesley Place.  Good coffee and quick breakfast options.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGZ1SkhREAE,"We were asked to wait for 20 minutes due to business, not the restaurants issue although annoying. Upon getting seated we were then asked to give up out table (we were a party of 3) and got moved to a small square table that wasn't adequate for all our dishes. My chicken katsu burger was drowned in mayonnaise so much so it spoilt the meal. My son who needed a dairy free burger (As he is intolerant to dairy) had his served with the cheese scraped off but still apparent. We won't be returning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScC15eWRnEAE,staff are super friendly and service fantastic. Food so delicious and well flavoured. Definitely will come back. Great work guysüëç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjVIbjNnRRAB,Great for late night dinners. Beef bulgogi and the stews are super good. Highly recommend

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobnVDODZnRRAB,"Great service from Alex, amazing food, drinks, and atmosphere. Would highly recommend if you enjoy Korean food or drink"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeTQzazJ3RRAB,"I think this relatively new restaurant was quite average overall. Kind of surprised because there are many Korean restaurants in Melbourne these days and the competition is crazy.  The quality of foods needs a bit of improvement as they tend to me lukewarm and of meh quality (especially considering the price tag). The quantity was heaps tho.  On the positive, they had a great variety of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages.  It'd be good for the people craving for some night snacks / supper and alcoholic beverages."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod0kyMTZ3RRAB,"No, it must be delicious, Jeungmalu... .! Melbourne's best service, good taste!! The plating is great! I wish you a great success, Yonggari~"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcWItT3dnRRAB,"This is the most popular place in Melbourne!!! Most of the food is delicious (not in the picture, but the soft tofu stew is delicious), and the snacks that go so well with soju The owner is so kind. It's the best bar in Melbourne.üëçüèª"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCekpDQTl3RRAB,"One of the best Korean restaurants!!! Wow, I'll come back two, three, four times!! The staff are so kind, especially the manager? Really very kind!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCczg3Y1FBEAE,"Food is good. It's pretty authentic if you miss Korea and Korean food. Had the Budae Jjigae with added on glass noodle, such a nice comfort food on a cold day. The place is relatively new, taking over the previous Gami Chicken bar location, staff was also new so service isn't up to standard yet as I did go in with my baby there... they didnt know where to put us.., it's not a place to bring a pram in there due to limited moving space, they also don't have baby seating so if you really want Korean food, you can either strap bubba on a baby carrier to yourself or visit another Korean restaurant with larger space. I'd still give 5 stars because they did their best to accommodate us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNVo3eWlBRRAB,"The worst Korean Food I ever had, their Kimchi served tiniest side plate. No side dishes per tradition. All foods overly drenched in sauce poor standard. The waitress could not speak English either. Don't waste your time and money here. I am Korean from Sydney and I never had such terrible Korean food anywhere in the world."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOXJtMnlnRRAB,"The food here is so delicious All the staff are friendly, especially the Korean male staff. I'll come back next time!!!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNkp2ZGVnEAE,The sesame dressing cold noodle is soooo good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjZma09BEAE,Food is amazing but is a but pricey. They barely speak english which makes it hard to order and i was missing things in my order which i paid for but after finally getting home i found missing
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGFQR0pREAE,"Chicken was decent. Chips were stale and cold, lacked salt (Fried Chicken lunch pack)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3NXRUJREAE,"test good, good for ppl who like sweet flavour. service is good. Happy with the experience"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSako2YzZBRRAB,"Half chicken in just ok. Small too serving for $28 imo. 'half' isn't really a helpful measurement.,"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3Blczl3RRAB,Melb foodie brought me here.  It didn‚Äôt disappoint! So good!! Great value and cute decor. Yummy food.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOEpDc3ZBRRAB,"The chicken was absolutely incredible, truly succulent, the ONLY reason it isn‚Äôt 5 stars is because the chips cost $14 for what was a small probably oven baked serving of chips (see photo for proof that we ate everything including the box)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteWVlUGF3EAE,Yum and quick! I'd come again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteE1ES2NREAE,My favorite chicken place in Melbourne...üíì

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteXR5eDJ3RRAB,Delicious Korean Fried Chicken at this new shop. Highly recommended. Food is delicious and ambience is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbi1Xb25BRRAB,"Excellent Korean street food. About a month ago I had my first tteok-bokki (regular size, $13.10) which I wanted extra spicy and it was delicious. The rice cakes were soft and the sauce complemented it perfectly! Last week I ordered their fried chicken sweet chilli (half size, $28.22). It was fantastic! I have tried fried chicken in other Korean outlets before, and this place definitely ranks among some of the best! Although the food is a bit on the pricey side, the quality and flavours make up for it, big time. The staff are friendly and courteous.  P.S. The box that I got the fried chicken in was cute and well made!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURld2Q2cm5nRRAB,"This would have to be one of, if not the best Korean Fried chicken I‚Äôve ever eaten. (I‚Äôve tried most places in Melbourne). Really good quality sauce, quality juicy chicken that‚Äôs still crispy on the outside even after been dosed in sauce.  Bit more expensive then other places but definitely worth it. I had the ‚Äúsweet spicy‚Äù and ‚Äúhoney butter garlic‚Äù. Will order again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlenNidjRnRRAB,"The best chicken restaurant near my house! Considering the taste and amount, I think it's cheap. Sweet chili was the best korean chicken I've had in Melbourne. Chips was also very satisfied. I want to eat it every day üòä"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2LXFXMmpRRRAB,"Best Korean fried chicken ever!! Not oily, super crunchy, and great flavour!! Cheese balls were good and so were their chips!  Addit: we have ordered from kko kko >5 times and it is still the absolutely best!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX0k2M3FBRRAB,Countless repurchases! Thumbs up!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDdXRV9RRRAB,"Amazing food. Lovely service, Low noise atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHBEcnFnRRAB,This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Melbourne! I used to try this restaurant last 4 years ago and then I back to visit again and again. We always order Glass noodle with minced chicken salad and Thai hot pot (Mhoo jum). The food is excellent and great prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkxhVGVREAE,Cure little restaurant with very friendly stuff. I had the Pan Thai and they were absolutely delicious. Paid under $20 so all in all absolutely recommendable!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdk5EclBBEAE,We‚Äôve eaten here on several occasions now and always enjoyed it. The menu has some unique dishes you don‚Äôt see in mainstream Thai restaurants and we‚Äôve never had a bad dish. Friends we‚Äôve invited have always agreed it is great. The staff are super friendly and prices are very reasonable. It‚Äôs small and not so fancy but that‚Äôs often the recipe for the best food. We highly recommend you try it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE1MTENnEAE,Every meal we had was absolutely delicious. 3 of us dined in with 3 meals and 2 rice and it was less than $60. Highly recommend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb05hcG1nRRAB,Great food at an affordable price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWMyakRnEAE,"Beautiful food, and nice atmosphere. Makes you feel like you are in a restaurant in Bangkok"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNllPWjV3RRAB,"Really had some delicious food from this restaurant. I had takeaway so can't comment on the dining experience. But I can comment on the food! The massaman slow-cook beef curry was simply incredible, super rich, maybe the best I've had in years. HIGHLY recommended. (I think they use the same sauce for all meat-variants so go chicken if you don't eat red meat). The fried rice was simple, fresh, tasty and exactly what you would expect. I also had the chicken satay which was quite good. And had a roti as well, which was a good quality version. All in all, recommend this place for quality Thai food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLS15UGhnRRAB,"A nice Thai restaurant with a decent list of items to choose from. For dinner I ordered Crispy Basil Century Egg with chicken ($18.90) and Roti Bread ($3). I loved both the items my only peeve being the price for the quantity. Nonetheless, the food was delicious, with the roti bread going well with the meat. The receptionist was very friendly and helped me choose the item as I hadn't eaten it before. The place has a nice vibe and looks cool. If price isn't an issue for you, I recommend checking out this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeUtXX193RRAB,Good food and very kind staff :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMGRLdm93RRAB,Lovely staff with great Thai food compared to Thai food in the CBD. Reasonable price for the portion as well. I‚Äôve come back a few times and always very happy with the service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMGRMZmFnEAE,Lovely staffs and great food. Prices are reasonable. Will definitely come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc3UtR2RBEAE,Yummy food. Nice service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNzdtZURnEAE,Great food. Try the satay.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtelpIZUp3EAE,Food was sooooo good! Really authentic thai food. Pad thai prawn was yummy & chinese broccoli & crispy pork. Yum yum yum! Really recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMHFuSndRRRAB,Lumpy and soggy rice with not fragrant as fried rice. Fried chicken ribs were dry and chewy (barely any crunchiness). I am quite disappointed with this order.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdUtINkFREAE,Use to be my favorite restaurant but when I went back last time food wasn‚Äôt that good anymore
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaTRMQk5nEAE,"Very authentic food, it tastes similar to what I‚Äôve had in Thailand. Also really great service the place is a vibe."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnVfZTlRRRAB,"I ordered Chicken Larb and Tomyum seafood and the food tasted really good with good amount and blend of spices. They were super authentic, I felt I was back in Bangkok üòä the price is standard but the portion is quite small. All considered, I will absolutely come back for their Chicken Larb ü§©"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcnI3UGpnRRAB,The ambience was absolutely appealing. The cuisine was delightful. The taste was absolutely diverse and delicious. That lingering taste stays with you and you are drawn back for more
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXZxZXJRRRAB,Small number of tables in restaurant but we went on a wet night and it was quiet. Wonderful food!! Lovely wait staff. Best desserts I‚Äôve had in years.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGNibjdBRRAB,"This is definitely strange place and loud even at 6pm. I don‚Äôt mind the eccentric nature, however the food is greasy and truly inedible. We have to now go for dinner again next door."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNlpyclRBEAE,It's terrible and expensive
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOEpEWTl3RRAB,"A bit too salty for my liking ü•≤ wish it could be les salty and more spicy tho Highly recommend to try pork intestines, mini beef skewers, cucumber salad and pig brain"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbUlxakdREAE,"Nice place for skewers. Love Pipi vermicelli, Lamb skewers and eggplant pork minced . It's quite salty for oysters and the song is abit loud."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaTh1dnBRRRAB,Ordered 8 lamb skewers and they all had about 20g of meat on them. For $16 I felt pretty cheated. Buyer beware !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaThLSDV3RRAB,Bro I paid $16 for 8 of the smallest skewers I've ever seen. $16? Look at the photo. Ridiculous.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtamFiTzdBRRAB,"I don't know why the takeaway beef ribs called this time are different from the past. I don't care about the ok shape, but why are the small pieces of beef ribs surprisingly hard? The big piece is the normal taste in the past, but this small piece is obviously seriously dehydrated and can‚Äôt be chewed... It‚Äôs hard not to let me imagine that this is leftovers from other people‚Äôs food, reheated and sold to takeaway customers, do you really think that others are idiots? ? So disappointing..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd01XUHdnRRAB,"Delicious north-eastern Chinese food - we had lamb rib, squid and lamb skewers, salads and kimchi fried rice. Excellent service and beautiful decor. Outstanding dinner event!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbU8yWERBEAE,"I have been coming to this restaurant for at least 5 years, and now I have to come here on Friday and Saturday, and there is a resident singing. Love the taste and atmosphere  My favorite stinky tofu was not photographed...because I was rushing to eat it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbUw2MExREAE,Melbourne BBQ Ceiling! Always.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdkxtZTlBRRAB,Initially we booked somewhere else but they cancelled on us. SOOO GLAD that they did that because we came here instead and it was one of the best experience and BBQ I've ever had. Everything was seasoned to perfection. Everything was cooked to perfection as well. The live karaoke was great! The singer had an amazing voice. To top it all off the staff was very accommodating! Will come back in a few weeks!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyakttODF3RRAB,"The most pit restaurant in Melbourne Poor service attitude very ordinary food expensive and not worth it Everyone, think twice before acting! !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyakthdFlnEAE,Too small sizes. Alittle bit expensive for what you get.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybEk2eVNBEAE,"There are few people on weekdays, the food is served quickly, and the taste is good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbXVxR2Z3EAE,The food tasted nice but got cold really quick. Thought that foil thing was to keep warm of the food.. unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbjl2LUlnEAE,Food was not bad but service was terrible. Go here to get Ignored and forgotten.  They even forgot a few of our entrees.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbUxUSk1REAE,"The portion of the dishes is too small... out of 10 points, I will give 4 points for the taste, 3 points for the environment, 4 points for the service, and 1 point for the overall."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaW9tRVdnEAE,"Got the pork donkatsu kim-bab and cheese balls. The kimbap was delicious with a great rice-content ratio! The cheese balls were very tasty, however they dont have much cheese in them üòÖ"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDdmZVhREAE,"We loved EVERYTHING about this restaurant. From the food to the service, it was perfect. If you're looking for authentic korean street food in Melbourne city, you need to visit Familee. Make sure you order ramen and cheese to be added to your tteoboki, you will not be disappointed ü§§ Best part is that the food is reasonably priced. We will definitely return!"

Not a lot of places generously coat their chicken with snow cheese. Best to eat warm with tteok-bokki or rice.  We‚Äôve actually been eyeing on this place as it‚Äôs not too far from our go-to area üëÄ They have variety of items to choose from, the most important thing is they have kimbab AND tteok-bokki cause not a lot of korean places have both (I like to dip my kimbab in tteok-bokki sauce üòã).

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGZtTlN3EAE,Entry level Korean food but hearty and good value.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGI2ZXhnRRAB,A lot of delicious food and Soju .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXE2NERREAE,This has to be one of the Korean restaurants in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXM3LXhnRRAB,Great food and drinks with great pricing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXM3MDJBRRAB,Yummy food and drinks.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaEptRlNBEAE,"I did an Uber Eats for my first order with this restaurant and absolutely loved the food and how they treated their customers. I have been planning to go there to eat but because of my hours at work, I did delivery instead and everything in my order was fresh and neatly package. Already ordering another Uber Eats tonight. Will definitely plan on going into the restaurant one day so I can try their order items which is not in their take away menu and their cocktail drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0x2Y0NnEAE,"Probably one of the best places in the city for Korean street foods like kimbab, tteokbboki, Korean pancakes, etc. Just don't expect things like the army stew, bibimbab, a wide range of side dishes etc. Go to Han Sang for that.  They also do Korean fried chicken (I mean every non-Kbbq Korean restaurant does these days), and it tasted amazing too.  The staff were friendly and the foods came out pretty quickly as well which was a bonus point in my book.  Overall, highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc09hZVlnEAE,"Please pay attention to the packing. Not once or twice, I ordered a takeaway delivery, but the packaging was like shit, so I threw it away without being able to eat it. Pay expensive money and pay attention to the packaging. It feels like opening a random box."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0x5emZnEAE,The best Korean fried chicken. Free drink for a review üôÇ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd0lTSGhBRRAB,Plenty of delicious food options and great cocktails. Friendly staff and cute cutlery :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDRPOWl3RRAB,"The restaurant shown that closing time was 10pm, but when I went here at 8.45pm, two female staff told us that they accepted last order at 8.15pm. We couldn‚Äôt dine-in anymore. We were starving, and really disappointed. Normally, if the restaurant close at 10pm, they will accept last order at 9.30pm."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dksybldBEAE,Went there for a private function.  Quality food and lovely service! I‚Äôll be coming back for sure.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkx5RGZ3EAE,"Gorgeous restaurant with amazing Italian cuisine. The pizza and pasta were both flavourful and delicious, the drinks were lovely and service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ckp1QllBEAE,Front of house are fantastic. Great service and very accommodating. Great atmosphere and staff are very professional.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ckxtS093EAE,Warm welcoming venue for the farewell lunch with colleagues. Love the PROSCIUTTO Pizza. Great location in CBD. Would return next time. üòäüëçüëçüëç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eU9lU2dnRRAB,"Amazing little spot, with a splendid menu, decently priced and amazing drinks as well.  Would highly recommend for date night, or even after work dinners. Staff are also friendly and service is quick!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d096bUlnEAE,Still trying to find the meatballs and the salami in the cannelloni. üò™
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z052LVhREAE,"Yes!!! 10/10!!! Cannot wait to come again. Only thing - I wish burrata was still on the menu. Great staff, great ambience, insanely delicious food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPallUdmh3RRAB,"Nice Italian, not a huge range of options to choose from. Didn‚Äôt think it was bad didn‚Äôt think it was anything special, a little overpriced for what you received."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3V6UnB3RRAB,"Cool space on exhibition st in an old church that‚Äôs been renovated inside and also the option for a cocktail out in the garden. Really solid Italian food and great service, what‚Äôs not to like"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXN5Q2tnRRAB,Great pasta not bad pizza. Need to work on keeping the front door closed during the colder months and the pizza is not the best.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnX2FUTTZnRRAB,"Amazing location, amazing food and of course the atmosphere great Italian feeling will be back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobDRySGJ3EAE,"Amazing!!! My friend and I ordered the Spicey Vodka Rigatoni and the Casarecce, in addition to several cocktails. Ray, our super friendly and bubbly wait staff, was able to make some amazing recommendations according to our individual taste palates. We received our food and drinks quickly and were thrilled with the flavours. Will absolutely return again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkxUNUZBEAE,"Really love their Spicy Vodka Rigatoni, this was my second time having it and it really is delicious! Worth trying and lives up to the hype. Only wish was that we could have sat inside, however the staff were so lovely and provided us with a heater as we were sitting outdoors."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN0lXSVVREAE,Pepe's Italian was a delightful dinner spent with friends. Such a warm and lively atmosphere and the food was delicious. Their amaretto sours were also great. The waiters were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely visit again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSakw2Vk9REAE,"Lovely place to go with any company, been to this place with friends, colleagues and family. Always enjoyed their food and drinks"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdEs2dUpnEAE,"This is the best place for authentic Italian diner foods. The place was so cozy and cute, both the outdoor and indoor seating areas are very aesthetic and great to take photos in! The customer service was very good, all staff were as quick as they can be, and even though it was quite busy, the food came out pretty quick. The food, is on a whole different level! If you're coming here, definitely try the Vodka Rigatoni Pasta, it is heavenly!!!! It's like God made it himself, I have never tasted a pasta so well made and fresh and my friends and I started levitating from our tables upon trying it. The foccacia bread is out of this world too! Definitely would recommend coming to this place, I will ABSOLUTELY be a repeat customer :) Best food and service I've had post-Covid era."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUxDc0VBEAE,"The food is authentically Italian, service is great and the atmosphere is beautiful. A little pricey for Italian, but the serves are good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaU5UQkRnEAE,"Great food, great service and great atmosphere, would have gave it 5/5 but i personally dont like using QR codes to order food,drinks. But apart from that, great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ05HTmNBEAE,Sat outside in an area that was so dark that we needed to use a torch to order. We asked the waitress for a candle however the candle never arrived. Meals were ok but at best served lukewarm not hot & this really spoils a meal. Would not rush back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzZTZ2hnRRAB,Great.  Rae and Amelia were fantastic... food super too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTd6c2NnEAE,Great relaxing place for a pizza and a beer.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScllpX0h3EAE,Pulled in for a drink before dinner. Loved the cocktails and the ambience of the garden in the middle of the city!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbWNDc1dREAE,We
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXI3YWNnEAE,There are lots of options to choose from and the place has nice decor.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHRyVzlBRRAB,"Great food options, attentive staff and a great ambience. Great place for a lunch or after work drinks"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVlQSmR3EAE,Prior to Covid 19 I came across this restaurant when I was craving for jajangmyeon ( black bean noodles) and it was mind blowing. Service was friendly and servicing of the food was very massive.  Went back today to try it again and had to wait a long time to be seated. No one came to check on people waiting outside in the cold. Had the black bean noodle  and sweet and sour pork sirloin and it was very average. The batter on the pork sirloin was very bland and the sweet and sour sauce which came at the side was very sweet and nothing sour. Believe me serving was massive but taste wise very disappointing.  Black bean noodle tasted nothing like before and if anything very sweet and filled with onion. I rather go for something small and nice.  Honestly I would give 1 star  for today but considering I did had a good experience couple of years ago keeping it to 3.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2VMcFFREAE,Strong Pork smell Super sweet Really bed tasting in my life Also expensive
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbVBqRk5REAE,"I returned after a few years. The sweet and sour pork is still so delicious and there is a lot of it. They say the batter is thick, but in fact, I don't think this is authentic sweet and sour pork. These days, sweet and sour pork with glutinous rice is fried thinly, but I think all Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood used to do this. It's been a while since I ate so deliciously. (The jjambbong is way worse than I thought, so I deducted one star. It only tastes like red pepper powderü•≤ But the jajangmyeon and sweet and sour pork are the best in the city.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScy1mUDZnRRAB,Traditional Korean. Excellent
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHY3QTN3RRAB,"I think I finally found a Chinese restaurant that suits my taste. I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered tangjjamyeon, but didn't you make a mistake in the size of sweet and sour pork? I was surprised because it was so big. It seems to be used often."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHJXOEFREAE,I would say this place is the best Korean&Chinese restaurant as all the dishes are absolutely decilous also the amount of food is generous :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaExTNGtnRRAB,"I cooked jajangmyeon, and even fried eggs were perfect!!üëç The tangsuyuk was full of meat and was so delicious!! Among the sweet and sour pork I ate in Australia, I ate it with the most satisfaction! I don't think you're skimping on ingredients!!! Totally recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLTV2ZmFBEAE,"Food is good and portion is generous, but their prioritization needs work. Our table and the table next to ours ordered ( waitress even placed docket) before this huge group even came in, but their group was served first.  For the record, we came in at 1:40-ish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGQyTjl3RRAB,I didn't taste it as delicious as it was advertised on the Internet. but not bad Cheap and large
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMllyR1d3EAE,Authentic Korean Cuisine
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX1BUcjRRRRAB,"The service lady seems to be a novice. compared to customers, space was not ample. that's a shame. The amount of food was incredibly so much. The taste was as good as Chinese resto in Korea. So impressed.  All you remember is plz DO NOT order too much as the amount of each food will be beyond your imagination.  I enjoyed it very much. They give you a take out box. 0.5Aud though"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnZ08tQWdBRRAB,Very nice black bean noodle
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocU5HVEtBEAE,Highly recommend take away half and half with sweet and sour pork and what ever you would like to choose.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaDkzLUhBEAE,The jajangmyeon from this place is absolutely delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbllMTkJnEAE,"I ordered fried rice with veg and soup, but no soup was served as I expected (?). Instead, a soy sauce dipping was served? (photo attached)The presentation of the dish needs improvement as well.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOXM2ZUt3EAE,"I came and ate jjajangbap and jjamppong, and the jjajangbap felt like eating 3-minute jjajang on top of Hetbahn. It was nice that there was a fried egg. That's all. Jjambbong seems to be cooked without seasoning by the real boss. The quantity was really large. I recommend it if you want to fill your stomach regardless of the taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMUwtQ3pBRRAB,I was there 25 years ago and was disappointed that I could not find my fav dishes in the menu
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbWFlTVlnEAE,Friendly  staff. Schnitzel  can br over pplrd sometimes and vogfr brand are good just inconsistent narrates I b tried to rate 3.5bstars
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3R6eGJ3EAE,Great coffee and pastries. Try the almond croissant!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTU2MlVnEAE,They say they‚Äôre open until 4:30 but I went in at 3:39 to get a juice as they sell freshly made juice and they had already cleaned and washed the machine. So if you want a juice maybe go an hour before closing‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjU3ZG5RRRAB,"Get the hash browns! The BEST hash browns ever. The rest of the food was also wonderful, and service staff were very warm and kind."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSazlIcWVBEAE,"Ventured to Madame Brussels Lane to find a narrow bustling laneway filled with office workers and lined with casual eateries. The lunchtime crowd meant some venues already had lines and while seating is limited, some offer indoor seating. Mellow Beans offers a nice variety of offerings from a breakfast menu, coffee, sandwiches, wraps, panninis but also a hot food range of home style cooking. I chose the southern fried chicken burger with chips which presented a tasty burger, crispy tender chicken with a lovely slaw and tasty chips. Certainly good value and caters for a variety of tastes.  @MellowBeansMelb #HomeMadeFood #lunch #burger #SouthernFriedChicken #chips #melbournefood #melbournecbd @zomatomelb"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnBuLUh3EAE,"The team were great, service was friendly and the coffee was delicious. I popped into the Melbourne store for a coffee. Mellow beans is one of Melbourne's coffee establishments and I enjoy my visits.  They have great varieties of food, including Vincys championship coffee.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZzRfOVpBEAE,"We visit this cafe and it was packed. Coffee was amazing. We had the Brekkie roll, the hashbrown was super crunchy. A must visit when in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtczdTSmxBRRAB,Good coffee and great food. Service was a rad slow but we were a large party
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM09EcEhREAE,I asked for the balsamic roasted mushrooms without pumpkin bread. After checking if this was ok (why?) my meal was delivered with other bread that I didn‚Äôt ask for. The mushrooms were lukewarm at best and had no hint of balsamic. A disappointment.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ0xLNERnEAE,Delicious food and service !!! Be hurry up around 2 pm there are almost gone üòâ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaDYyZ1lnEAE,It's very delicious. The seafood risotto is very good. I still order takeaway. I believe it will be more delicious when I eat it in the store.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPak03cXh3RRAB,The best
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnVya1NBEAE,Mellow Beans is my favourite place for lunch in the city. The barista made drinks are amazing and they have a great selection of food. The cannelloni is outstanding. Not to mention the staff who are all lovely and always make you feel welcome. 5 stars!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzlhdF9BRRAB,This Cafe was one of our greatest finds in Melbourne. We had breakfast there every day of our stay. The food was delicious as well as great coffee. The place had a great vibe and the staff made you feel very special. Definitely recommend!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z3FQREJnEAE,5 stars- hands down! I‚Äôve finally found really good food in Melbourne. I had a lamb gozleme and I could not fault it. Wish I could eat two. Followed it up with a Turkish coffee to complete the experience. The owner advised she does the night markets in the city on Wednesday. I‚Äôll be going - no question.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdHR1Vm9BRRAB,Super friendly staff and amazing food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeXZlbml3RRAB,"Order Lamb Gozleme every time I visit the GTC. I love the thin dough of the Gozleme and of cos, the yogurt that comes with it! My last visit was 2 years ago, and finally I get to eat my favourite lamb Gozleme during my trip here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNDVQQVJREAE,Best gozleme in the city. Made fresh and the owner is kind and beautiful too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyenRlaDlnRRAB,The food was ok not that good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd01IYmFnEAE,Really nice Turkish food at the Vic Market.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaE1iZWVREAE,Would be one of the best gozleme ive ever had will be back for sure
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdjlhMXNBRRAB,"We were extremely dissapointed! Ordered 2x Deal3, spinach was not washed & not cooked ,also there was very little cheese in it. We've been charged $52 for 2x deal3 with 2xsliced toast & 2x small tea(bags).Tables were dirty..The worst gozleme I have ever had tasted.Overall very Low quality food and poor customer service.Never recommend this place to anyone."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtci15U3F3RRAB,"Breakfast- I can vouch for Breakfast menu #4 and #6, delicious. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Coffee is good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN2VhVnRnRRAB,"Maybe they have changed staff as all the previous reviews say the staff are friendly. We  were met with very uninterested and rude staff and honestly I have tasted much better Gozleme in Melbourne, wint be back. Not impressed"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNXY2S3Z3RRAB,"We weren‚Äôt overly impressed, but they were nice people. Maybe just need a bit more organization :)  Pros: 1. Nice staff  Cons: 1. The food was quite unattractive. 2. There wasn‚Äôt much flavor. 3. The tables were dirty. 4. Longer than usual wait time. 5. Ran out of knives."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNXVTYUNnEAE,"Went for breakfast, greeted by friendly staff and enjoyed an amazing Turkish breakfast and coffee. Will definitely be back and would recommend to others. $ Pictures = Breakfast 3 and Breakfast 6"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NEpxM0pnEAE,Absolutely stunning
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOF9QbElBEAE,"A good place to get some fresh gozleme takeaway. I pass by on my way to work, and sometimes get breakfast here which was different but still amazing. Efficient service and friendly staff. Definitely recommend going to Gozleme Turkish Cafe if you're around the area"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4Z3NlVUN3EAE,"Fresh gozleme, made to order, with delicious ingredients. A must for lunch if you're at queen Vic market , can't recommend highly enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbThDeVZBEAE,The dough is made by rolling out the dough as soon as you order it. delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNjdIVUt3EAE,Delicious Turkish Gozleme.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbzdHRF9RRRAB,I came a long time ago Pancake was delicious thank you very much for everything
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b0tXZUx3EAE,"My personal safe space and mood enhancer, all the food on the menu are delicious and affordable, the wait time is reasonable and worth it, the mood is just simply perfect. Probably one of the best restaurant i‚Äôve visited and will continue to do so. 10/10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjd6aGNnEAE,I consider JUSIK as the best authentic Korean BBQ in town. It‚Äôs small and owned by a traditional Korean family.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDhDUi1BRRAB,"this place is the worst!!!! do not come!!!!  (I don't want it to get so popular as I want to keep this place a secret for myself).  Agree with all the previous reviews!  I would say this is better than the Korean food in Sydney and the standard is already very high over here.  A fairly small restaurant yet the service is personable, quality is extremely high and the environment is intimate. Korean food done properly!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGMyTWNBEAE,"Amazing food, but the service along is worth the five star ü§© ‚Ä¶"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbW91bE93EAE,I‚Äôve found my new favourite Korean BBQ place! The service was amazing! The lady made sure all the tables got served well! It‚Äôs a small place near Victoria market. Best for you to book if you are coming with a large group. üëçüëçüëç  Been here few times already! Took my friends  and they loved it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ0ppaXRnRRAB,"Came here for Korean Fried Chicken.  Crispy outside and juicy on the inside.  We ordered half soy, which has a hint of sweetness; and the chilli, which is very very very hot.  Ask if you can have the chilli sauce on the side instead of mixed and coated onto the chicken.  Even the owner says it's too hot for her.  The restaurant is run by a friendly couple with the husband cooking and wife serving.  Good casual place to go to."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocVp2NjRRRRAB,This place is crazy. It's so delicious. We always come here. It's such a delicious restaurant. I recommend it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamVpOEJREAE,such a nice place and food from Korea
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3A3Q3ZBRRAB,Forever my favourite Korean BBQ Shopkeeper couple is so lovely and warm A very small but so cozy restaurant well managed my them Price and quality is just exceptionally great Just a set price include meat and fried chicken and salad and other small dishes (Which somehow is a crazy price)  Returned for few times and brought my friends too

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNjZpSFZREAE,"I went there with my partner few weeks ago and our dinner in this tiny restaurant was amazing! This was our first korean bbq and I couldn't ask for a better experience. Very caring staff, the lady helped us giving us advices on how eat the sides or telling us what was in there. Can't wait to go back! Highly recommended and thank you for having us! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdzhQbzZBRRAB,"Can't say more than what others have already written. Such a great place! Food, service, value were all amazing :)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMi1pSGFBEAE,"Opposite Queen Victoria Markets lies @HelloJose_Au for some Mexican fare. The hand pressed tacos looked appealing so got: - slow cooked beef, chipotle cream, pickled cabbage, chilli - beer battered fish, spiced up cream, pickled cabbage  A golden brown light super crispy batter encases perfectly cooked tender fish served along with a pickled cabbage. Very enjoyable particularly with a squeeze of lime.  The slow cooked beef is super tender and full of beef flavour, very tasty but needed a dash more seasoning. I like the Jalapenos which deliver a but of kick and background chilli hum. The corn tacos are also very enjoyable. Good size tacos with a range of hot sauces at the table, complimentary popcorn, Mexican themed chilled environment, lovely dinner, solid offering. Probably need to work on adding a salsa for that burst of freshness typical of a taco.  #MexicanFood #tacos #beerbatteredfish #slowcookedbeef #slaw #corntacos #foodie #melbournecbd #melbournefood @zomatomelb"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXFMaGpRRRAB,Service and food were good. The stained seat cushions could do with a wash. Tables built on milk crates are precarious - had part of my drink split on me due to the table slope and another party leaning on the end of the table.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobWFxTEtREAE,"The best!! Been coming for years. Fish taco, ceviche tastadidas, the corn chips, corn, margarita of course! Free pop corn when you arrive and produce is always so fresh. Make sure you leave space for the churros ü§§"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaHVlX3JRRRAB,"I wonder why there‚Äôs no long queue. This place is bomb! The staff are friendly, the restaurant itself especially the backyard is cozy and really nice setting. And the food?! BOOM!! The best and yummiest tacos I‚Äôve ever had! The most authentic tacos in Melbourne. Even the churros is really tasty. We smashed food as soon as served.  It might be taking so long to be served but I‚Äôm okay with that.  Without being disrespectful or reduce the authenticity I hope you guys have more halal option. But your food is 10/10!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoM0xTYmVBEAE,"Dropped by for a quick feed before Ed Sheeran concert, the food and cocktails were on point. Tacos came out quick and fresh with many hot sauce to choose from. The Jose fries were out of this world. Love the backyard laid back ambience. Would totally recommend everyone to come by this joint for a great night out with some friends. Prompt and friendly customer service üëç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMTRLZElBEAE,"Good food, outdoor set up lacks fans though so the outdoor area gets crazy hot. Sangria didnt have any fruit? Could be how theyre supposed be, who knows. Service was also good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodThXU2ZREAE,If you miss Mexican food here you will find very tasty taquitos. nice place has an interior terrace and very good attention from the team
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodzRhcXJBRRAB,"Relaxed ambience in the beer garden. Drinks were good. However, food was poor quality and served cold. Waitress told us two times that the chef wanted us to order so they could leave. That doesn‚Äôt make for such a dining atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbU5fLTZ3RRAB,"Been coming here for years. The crew, the food and the drink is incomparable to any other Mexican restaurant in Melbourne. I love everything about it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCal9xUDd3RRAB,"Was really excited to come try Hello Jos√© after driving past for years. All I can say is I‚Äôm disappointed with the experience.  We ordered the corn, totopos, ceviche tostadas, then a mix of tacos.  Ceviche was mostly missing, with only a few tiny pieces of fish on guacamole and an undercooked tostada, the corn was underwhelming with more mayo than any other topping.  Tacos took more than 45 minutes to come out after ordering. So be prepared to wait if you do come. There are better Mexican places (Mamasita or Hotel Jesus)in my opinion with higher quality ingredients.  After reading some of the other negative reviews I‚Äôm shocked to see how the owner has responded. I‚Äôd give this place a miss the disappointing experience is not worth the cost."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCal9qOUxBEAE,"Food is fantastic but the service stinks, been an issue since it opened but we keep coming back for some reason."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCN0lYWGtBRRAB,Alright - nothing spectacular. I would go there again. Food is good however nothing out of the ordinary
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbU1DOTdRRRAB,"The food was pretty good, but the margaritas (classic) were great. Busy time of year to be there and seemed to be one poor waitress run off her feet. Very Covid safe as you order at the table."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHNXTVVBEAE,"Loved the tacos!! Tortilla was perfectly toasted, the fish and chicken crispy, the salads fresh and the sauces are standouts. Really enjoyed our experience. We got here early (6pm) and by the time we were finished (7.30pm) it was packed. Tried the margs and corona beers, Delish. Food came out super quick, a nice touch was arriving and being offered popcorn as we used the QR code to order. Staff were so friendly, we‚Äôre definitely coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOFBtN2hnRRAB,Worst experience ever
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ3Etek1nEAE,Finally had a chance to check out Hello Jos√© and it was awesome. Great service and amazing food. The chips they make are on another level and are perfect for a starter and you absolutely have to get the corn. I tried the beef and chicken taco and they were delicious. ‚≠êÔ∏è
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlajdET0ZnEAE,"Very average tacos with an incredibly long wait time. To be fair we had a rather large group of approx 14 people, but still, it took them over almost an to serve our first dish. The service staff were really nice but unfortunately, it won't warrant my return as the service was too slow and there are better Mexican restaurants around the city."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMV9IQ3h3RRAB,Great food and even better vibes
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkxuUzhRRRAB,The best crispy pork Banh Mi I‚Äôve ever had! Wow really delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aEpYcF9BRRAB,I frequent this joint for my lunch whenever I visit Melbourne as I like their grilled chicken rice and coffee. Nice lady owner and cozy place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN182U2lnRRAB,A modest front with a killer classic VEGAN Bahn Mi. Please try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTkzdjRnRRAB,I had the chicken vermicelli and it was all fresh and tasty. Could of had cucumber.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd05hb3BnRRAB,Grilled pork vermicelli 5/5 Fresh 5/5 Clean 5/5
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaElDNHVnRRAB,The crispy pork banh mi was delicious.  Service was quick and the staff were friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOTZ5Si13RRAB,Very much enjoyed my lunch visit. Such good tasty food and such reasonable prices. Service with a smile. Cheers.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbTlDU2VREAE,Excellent roast pork roll.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXRHakt3EAE,"Ordered the Grilled Pork with Egg Banh Mi. However, I was slightly disappointed with my overall experience.  The bun wasn't as crunchy as I had expected, there was no salad inside the banh mi. While the location is convenient for the tram catcher, the food didn't leave a lasting impression on me.  I hope that you take my feedback into consideration and make improvements to your menu and food preparation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobzdXSGpRRRAB,Great food and at a reasonable price.  Had a lovely crispy pork roll which I can thoroughly recommend. It was a bit quiet when we ate there so there wasn't much of an atmosphere.  Staff are incredibly friendly and hard working.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoallTNnF3RRAB,We had the beef pho and crispy pork rice. Crispy pork was quite good but Pho sadly didn‚Äôt have much flavour. I would recommend ordering something else.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoam83NDR3RRAB,"Wasn‚Äôt the best pho I‚Äôve ever had but it was still nice. Good broth and tasty pork, but just a shame the noodles were over cooked - almost impossible to pick up with chopsticks as they just brokeüòÖ Service was fast and it was nice to grab a seat and have something to eat on a break from market exploring"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdGN1WEtREAE,Pork not cooked property Had terrible food poisoning Tables dirty Place needs a good spring clean No food hygiene
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNzl2STlRRRAB,"Don‚Äôt come if you‚Äôre in a rush‚Ä¶. Got a roast pork banh mi takeaway.. It was good with crispy crackling and decent fillings. Only downside was the service - I was there at 8.30 and waited 15 min even though there were no other customers? They were making one immediately after I ordered but that was for a staff member, and for some reason they went back to preparing cabinet food before actually preparing mine - not sure why there was a wait since I saw them take my toasted bread out of their toaster oven 5 min before they actually made my banh mi :/"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdDZubWtRRRAB,"FANTASTIC BANH MI.  This place has some of the best value for money, tasty and carefully prepared food at Victoria Market!!  Great Vegetarian & Tofu Options.  Friendly and attentive customer service  Really Good!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbGFTYi1nRRAB,"Very friendly, helpful with dietary needs, and excellent food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaXE3S3dBRRAB,Conveniently located at one end of the Queen Vic Market. We tried the beef and chicken pho. The pho comes with a huge plate of veggies which is typically Vietnamese. The pho was tasty and we found the portion large. In Singapore yes we would pay more than a couple of dollars less but for half the portion. The avocado and mango shakes were so good value.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtak9hN29BRRAB,Best cafe ever I love it! Been there so many times they memorise my order. Best hot choccy and the food is very fresh
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtb2NhdUpREAE,Phuong and Alex make the best Vietnamese food in Melbourne hands down. Everything is always extremely fresh and the Pho broths are unbelievable. Definitely try this place!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcF9uWnRBRRAB,I eat a lot of bahn mi and this is one of the best I had. You won't regret it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlekpLUzlBRRAB,"For me this restaurant was the best banh mi in Melbourne. Now they're just a very bad copy, a banh mi with no margarine, no p√¢t√©, no coriander. Just cabbage, a bit of carrot, meat and mayonnaise !?! Never see mayonnaise in a banh me before. Very very bad place for banh mi."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX1llSW1nRRAB,"Delicious food! Worth the price, Pho's  Vegetable always fresh!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Nl9mOGt3RRAB,Crispy pork banh mi is great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d1p1OFBnEAE,You can‚Äôt walk past with being drawn in by the smells of pho (Vietnamese soup) and roasting pork and chicken for bahn mi.  The style of ban me here is a little different but still very tasty! They use a fresh cabbage filling that makes the roll taste very fresh. The child is mild so if you like spicy ask for extra.  Definitely worth a visitüê∑üå∂!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTlxRXp3RRAB,"Delightful coffee and the Turkish bread with old english cheese, chicken breast fillet. Real one!!!  not factory made imposter. Was we excellent, coming back for more very soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkpYbjl3RRAB,Very lovey owners and so fresh nussel with affordable price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ak9tRGFnEAE,Fresh and delicious üòã
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDhiZGVBEAE,"The owner is enthusiastic, the food stall on the car is very cute"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDRtSVFnEAE,Absolutely blown away by how good this place is!! The coconut cream one is the one we tried and we sipped every last bit of the broth. So delicious will be back again soon!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOC1IM1FBEAE,"So good, in almost every aspects"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDdQRUl3EAE,"Absolutely LOVE this spot in Queen Victoria‚Äôs Market. The mussel pot is a must have! Especially on a chilly morning! The mussels will warm you right up and help you start your day. I highly recommend trying the grilled garlic butter and breadcrumbs mussels or the steamed Chilli mussels, both which I really enjoyed. This place is definitely my Saturday mornings stop from now on!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWRTR09BEAE,"The wait is too long, we waited nearly one hour to get food. Stood 45 mins until we can order, the line didn‚Äôt look like that long but it was surprisingly slow. The cashier also overcharged us by $10, hopefully it was just because of mathematical error? (It was simple calculation though) we ask for $10 refund and got it back. The food was nice but definitely not worth the wait."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWMzaHR3RRAB,The best mussels in town! Definitely worth the queue. A must try. The mussels are very fresh and they have a variety of flavours as to how you want it cooked. My personal favourite is the chilli coconut cream then comes the steamed blue cheese.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbG9yaENBEAE,"So interesting small van restaurants üíï. The foods is all about Mussel. Good stop for you after long walking Queen Victoria market. Want to try again for other tastes. I was have Coconut chili So good üòä. Lovely two of owner, gentle Women. Beautiful smile üíï"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE5tZ01nEAE,Fantastic!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGZfNEVREAE,We really love going back here and always order the chilli coconut cream. Perfect for the chilly days. The mussels are cooked fresh and the soup goes really well with the bread.  Be prepared for the long lines though but it‚Äôs really worth it. It‚Äôs ran by a nice couple so best be patient with them. Will always be coming back here and might try the bleu cheese one next time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnZyUWZREAE,"Food is good, but there is a long waiting time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3RXVGxBRRAB,Haven't stopped dreaming of coming back to this place lol  Best $13 of 2023 so far!  Be prepared to line up for a hit but it's worth it!!  Come early to make sure they don't sell out on you. Mine were the 4th last serving but that was at 3pm.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNVBHM2lBRRAB,"Been hanging for some Belgian style mussels pot. So tried this little outfit in QVM and they did not disappoint. Valued at $15 per pot. One pot is looking roughly about 400 to 450 grams, and served with 2 slices of bread. Variety of flavours available, ie: - classic white wine with option to add cream, - chilli coconut cream - tomato & chilli - creamy blue cheese - red wine, tomato, & chilli. Tried the first three flavours mentioned above, and must say the chilli coconut cream was the best out of the 3. Mussels were fresh, plump, and juicy. Queue was quite long, so be ready to wait a bit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUstaWNREAE,Yummm Chili Coconut Cream is the best!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNkpDNGZ3EAE,"It was salty, dirty and terrible to eat. The old woman said I didn't collect my plate cleanly, I collected it twice and felt like I became a waiter instead of a customer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocDZpZkNREAE,Worth every second of wait. Ask for extra bread pay a bit more. You‚Äôll thank me later
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeC1YQ3RRRRAB,"We we're lucky enough to find a seat prior to 12pm, and boy am I glad we did, the chilli coconut cream muscles,  wowzer absolutely fantastic, we'll definitely be back.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOC1pZDB3RRAB,"Really nice and fresh mussel, MUST try in Queen Victoria market"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMDZhLUVBEAE,"These mussels have just earned my award for the BEST dish at the QVM. If you are looking for super speeding service and scoffing down something in your break, this ain‚Äôt your place. The two ladies tucked away in the ‚Äúshell‚Äù shaped van work hard, but are limited on space, so when you finally get your order every bite is worth it. So slow down, choose a favourite and get chatting to those persons that are eagerly awaiting. Game changer."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNDZlTHFRRRAB,"After reading the reviews we headed to the Vic Market to experience some yummy mussels. This was our experience. We ordered popular one on the menu with coconut cream & chilli, they were very tasty however the other ""steamed white wine, garlic & parsley"" were bland and tasteless. They were fresh but couldn't get any flavours, the liquid in the bowl was from the mussels. On their white board menu it reads as steamed white mussels but if you want the onion & cream you have to specify & it's extra however on their printed board menu it has a photo of them advertised steamed white wine mussels $15 - which is what we saw & thought we were getting! We didn't enjoy them at all & when we asked the lady said ""you didn't ask for the cream & shallots"" - well, it's not what their printed menu advertises. The tables were dirty & it wasn't a busy time. We asked for a napkin to wipe them down."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGJpVUhnEAE,"I recently visited this mussel place and was impressed with the quality of their freshly cooked mussels. I appreciated that the mussels were cleaned and had the beards removed, which made them easy to eat. The prices were also quite reasonable. Overall, I had a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious and affordable mussels."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGRhWGx3RRAB,I saw a long queue at this food truck at QVM and decided to join the queue to settle my lunch. The store is run by a lovely couple and they only selected the good quality mussel in the dishes they serve. Had the coconut cream steamed mussels which came with probably around 12 big sized mussel with 2 slices of bread which taste really great when dipped in the sauce. The coconut cream's taste is quite strong and I truly enjoyed it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobnNIQ05BEAE,Chili coconut sauce $16 The sauce is creamy and spicy The taste is great !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWU2SFdREAE,"Located inside victoria market, they have the best mussels ever! Besides the popular menu, we tried grilled mussels too and it was soo delicious. Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM292M01nEAE,"Just right there in the temporary fruit n vege section.  Ordered a pot of  Steamed White Wine mussels.   Since it is made to order, there is a short wait.  Plenty of seating available all around the camper van. Mussels are delicious.  Although it is White Wine with Cream, it is still able to keep the sea saltiness flavour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaXZMTkRREAE,"One of the best mussels place in Melbourne. Located right at Queen Victoria market along the small vegetable stalls. A mussel like shaped store with teny tiny chairs and tables around for sitting, with small flower pot around the bench. This has been one of my favourite go to for mussels for the past 4 years. Weekend gets busier and so during the weekdays. Over the years, the   service and taste remained the same if anything, better than so many other places. Every time I go there I always order the chilli mussels hot hot hot üî• as I like it that way and Mr. Mussels makes it with a bright smile.  They also have cheese and coconut and other options, which are fairly good. Good food and  amazing ambience üëè  Will definitely recommend this if you are visiting Queen Victoria Marlet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodUt2ZzN3RRAB,So fresh!!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2Rqc2R3EAE,The flavor of black pepper is great. Eats with onions make the sausage taste better
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNG8ydUxREAE,Genuine tasty Bratwurst! Kids love them!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUpISC1nRRAB,"The best bratwurst I have ever had. Usually, I will order 1 with bread roll and another without to satisfy my cravings whenever I come to Queen Victoria Market. üòã."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGZuNndBRRAB,"Good sausage and bread, non-stop queue"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHNXdll3EAE,"There is almost one person in the neighborhood, and there is only take-out, but there are outdoor tables and chairs next to you to sit and enjoy. The taste is really good, but considering its price, you can try it when you pass by, but it is not recommended to make a special trip"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVAyNmpBRRAB,"Fast service even with a crowd. Was tasty, had the cheese bratwurst . Yeah I'd eat here again. 5 stars good all round."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjhfWEdnEAE,First time here and the food was amazing. Love the simple flavours and freshness. Will definitely go back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNWNyT0lREAE,It was my first time having Bratwurst and it was really yummy üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNGNmRXJnRRAB,"A lot of staff around to help you out, so it was a quick Saturday morning breakfast. Ordered the curry wurst with sauerkraut and caramelised onions which was awesome! üëåüèªüëåüèª The sausage was crispy outside and juicy inside, also the curry sauce has a nice kick to it. Overall cost $10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod0lDeGRREAE,"The asian guy server is one of THE RUDEST i have ever encountered. The rorst customer service and very bad attitude from staff. Do not recommend, the food's not even good. Bread's not fresh. Walk past this one"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCX3BmemZ3EAE,"They cheated my money. Bought 8 dollars meal. I was only given a change of one dollar return for 10 dollars. When asked, the guy cashier told me it was  9 dollars instead. Insisted it wasn‚Äôt 8 dollars. Terrible"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCODktRTNRRRAB,Been my go to for many years.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdy1DZ3dnRRAB,Because of the service as he was really friendly . Last day in Melbourne before heading to Syd. Very filling with the roles being fresh as well .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLWF6UTlRRRAB,Simply an awesome experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdWJmZXBnRRAB,"Ate here twice and loved the topping choices. Some wasabi detected, so be careful. Overall, brilliant eating experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCb3AyYU53EAE,What can you say? - New York City has Katz's Deli for beef brisket and we Melburnians have the Bratwurst Shop. Equal standing iconic instituitions dedicated to meat meeting bread. Be a BBQ legend this Christmas and 'snag' a dozen or more of their vac sealed sausages.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZ3RQWHNBRRAB,"Busy and buzzing when I got there. I got currywurst with sauerkraut and extra tomato sauce on chips. All in all was 10$. The sauce they put on the currywurst is to die for, they need to put more!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZ3ZUN2lBRRAB,"Taste-wise, this is the closest you‚Äôll get to a proper German bratwurst in Melbourne. Went there and got a Wei√üwurst without any toppings, just a bit of mustard to see if I‚Äôll be a returning customer and because it seemed weird to put anything else on there üòÇ  Anyway, I was happy and I‚Äôll be back to try some other sausages!!  Black pepper and chorizo sounds delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteF9lUkV3EAE,"Choose sausage first, White Pork is delicious. Then the clerk will put the sausage in the bread, ketchup, yellow mustard, onion, sauerkraut, cheese, the cheese is best placed under the sauerkraut and onion for better taste"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbHAyZDB3RRAB,"Place came highly recommended, didn't disappoint. I was there really early and even though they didn't have anything ready.  They whipped one up quick as"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGFHRXBBRRAB,$5 bucket chicken ribs It‚Äôs delicious! Crispy and juicy although a little bit salty but still love it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeDRtdWVREAE,"Friendly reminder, they are currently not opening from 29 of Dec to the 12 of Jan."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHa2E2SWNnEAE,"Best chicken shop in Melbourne.  This is the real reason that we travel to the Vic Market.  They have the best homemade gravy, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  Olivia and Chris go out of their way to provide fresh and yummy food.  Also try their chicken dumplings and chicken rissoles!  Super easy to cook on a busy night!  Thanks for all the fab products!  ** Update - Another brilliant turkey from the Corner Chicken Shop - it was perfect.  Thank you again for all your hard work.  The cranberry sauce is amazing!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbU1qYU9nEAE,"While the quality of the product is ok, we have paid for a cooler bag but the delivery came without the cooler with no explanation or refund. Not very honest!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ0pQNV9RRRAB,The only bad thing i can say is that they‚Äôre not all over the country! Their fried chicken is the best I‚Äôve ever had and even walked back from the city just to get more!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldHRMaWhnRRAB,Loved being able to order a very special item for my Canadian Thanksgiving.  Christmas is around the corner and I will be ordering from you again!!! Thank you!!!!ü¶Éüá®üá¶ü¶É

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajhpX2hRRRAB,"Wonderfully delicious chicken, they kept their standards high and consistent. Had their meals and ribs for almost 5 years now. Super friendly too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzhTeWJnEAE,Personally I found both the chicken ribs and chips were just average in taste. Both were actually a bit oily but overall okay for the price I paid.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2VYN0dBEAE,Do yourself a favour and visit the lovely Corner Chicken Shop! The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. Chris and Olivia are extremely generous and donated a Chicken Parma dinner night to the PVFC. The chicken  was absolutely amazing ‚Äì so succulent it melted in your mouths. Absolutely the best Parma I have had in a while!! Highly recommend! Chicken sausages are also so delicious. I look forward to trying lots of other things on the menu. Thank you for your generosity TCCS.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTl6TXhnRRAB,Great service high quality meat
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNS16Um5BRRAB,Great friendly service and always very hopeful with time to chat to regulars regardless of how busy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOWQyVURREAE,"Things are not always what they seem. I have bought two types of filled chicken things to be grilled in the oven. I may have another review.  Yes review has been :Edited - The two different filled chicken pieces were spot on - enormous flavour and definitely motivates me to come again to purchase !! Only four stars because of the freien chicken which I shared for lunch later with friends.  The third purchase were the saltiest fried chicken I‚Äôve ever experienced and you know, considering it was in The Queen Victoria market I was super disappointed- I expect the stalls that showcase their wares here to be exceptional and above and beyond the generic.  Majorly disappointed today. I discarded the leftovers.  The filled chicken pieces- eaten later on the weekend were fabulous. They were eaten too quickly for photos. Next time I‚Äôll take a pic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPXzVTaUZnEAE,"I have been shopping at the Corner Chicken Shop for over 10 years. All of their produce is amazing, the chicken is succulent and always delicious and their chicken sausages are heaven on earth!! Chris and Olivia are lovely, always friendly and their service is impeccable. I can not recommend the Corner Chicken Shop enough! Enjoy!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN2JLOFJREAE,"Fresh, plump chicken breast baked for my lunch; easy pre-crumbed schnitzels for the kids and tasty flavoured sausages (herb and garlic my favourite). Chris, Olivia and team provide the most amazing, personable customer service in the market. The Corner Chicken Shop is a must stop on everyone‚Äôs market visit"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb2U3WDdRRRAB,"Extremely rude service by a male staff. Had to ask for a receipt and given one only after the thlrd time as i stood there waiting for one. He was trying to laugh it away. There was no queue behind me. Such behaviour affects the experience of the tourists coming over here. Will lodge a complaint to the Vic Market manager. After reading those 1-star posts, this isn't the first time. Will rather buy KFC than subject to such behaviour in future. I don't really need a receipt, it is the way they treat customer thinking that it is ok to do so."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOUpLMjBRRRAB,"Their products are fresh and clean.  The best shop in the CBD area, especially the Queen Victoria Market.  All products are halal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcEtLcDBBRRAB,Been coming here for years so thought best I drop a review. Great value lunch which is increasingly hard to come by in the area. The owners and their workers always have a smile for you and will make you laugh. The chilli wings are the bomb. Lightning fast service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDazR1c2RBEAE,"I've never ever been here to this 21st century version but I do remember this eatery although the version I remember is vastly different and very basic to this newer version?! The version that I remember from over 29 years ago might or might not be the same franchise or it's seriously upgraded from what I remember it from 1989/90?! From what I remember as a kid, this place was owned by the son of the opposite Drago's eatery. He opened up this place up off the success of Drago's selling nothing but exclusively roasted barbecued/charcoaled chicken, think that he might of sold fresh range whole chicken as well to customers as well?!..It did okay but nothing like Drago's which I think the son hoped to emulate through the success of the fathers original franchise entrance next door. Now's there this newer variant which I'm not sure if it's still owned by the son of the father via Dragos (probably not now?!). It's so different to what I remember but this version looks like a success now then what it used to be?! If this place is still somewhat owned by the son of father's Drago's franchise?! Then out of respect to him?! I give him 5 stars because when the father wasn't around when myself and my mom came to Drago's?! He treated us real well, especially my late mother so kudos to him! I think that may of seen the son of Drago's still managing the original store but not the Corner Chicken Shop (don't remember the original franchise name before this?!)?! But out of respect to the Drago's original owner of this store when he did/if he does manage this place now?! 5 stars!!!!!  Update: 2022! I recently just went to Drago's out off curiosity (didn't order anything) on a Sunday and I found Corner Chicken Shop (opposite the entrance) to be fully closed up and empty!!!?! Like the stall was vacant or something?! Please tell me that you haven't closed up the shop after 33+ years here?!...Just want to confirmation here cheers..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ3VxMDR3RRAB,"Long term regular market goers - we only ever buy our chicken / poultry here, the flattened marinated chooks are lovely too - always exceptional food and fantastic service - we are not allowed to visit grandchildren without bringing them a big bag  of the best hot chicken ribs üò≥üëèüòÇ ‚Ä¶"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdnFXOXJnRRAB,"A restaurant quite big  but the manager is really rude and impolite. We ate there but used the outside area, when i took the kids to the toilet he refused.  Unprecedented bad attitude and I will never go back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldXVyUENREAE,"I paid with liven and it took about 20 seconds to get to the final page on my iPad, the guy after me was impatient and rude and verbally assaulted me, touched my back without consent, and your staff did nothing after this happened."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla3JyRDVBRRAB,Dry
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bmN5aGZnEAE,Worst sushi train ever. Zero selection to choose from. 20 minute wait to get ordered plates. Defeats the purpose of a sushi train

Not even the Prawn Katsu's going to keep me here. ***  2018: Hard to fault, consistent with all other hubs. They've transitioned into non plastic containers. Hard to beat Tokui though...  ...but that Prawn Katsu Roll, gets me every time. *****"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMnYzQVZREAE,Excellent service and delicious sushi. Platters were amazing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybkthYnR3RRAB,"Food is good, price reasonable. But the lady worker is so impatient. She did not give a chance for us to select other variety yet she keeps rushing. After packing she just ignored us and proceed to other customers. We was waited for the payment, to avoid the queue we asked another guy to proceed the payment for us and she got mad about it."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHekxEaDd3RRAB,Amazing value sushi but ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER! I‚Äôve been given the wrong thing or found things missing after I opened my box.  I know you‚Äôre busy but staff should be more careful as this has happened to me many times.  The quality and value is still good enough I keep coming back but if this keeps happening I‚Äôll just go somewhere else
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDVMX3NRRRAB,"nice gozlem but sometimes not heated properly, and sometimes wet and soggy, other times made properly. Good value at 5.00 each, and friendly quick service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMGNMREV3EAE,Good Gozleme...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmZfWWtRRRAB,Cheese&spinach gozleme was the best. Definetly will try the rest.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWVLWllBEAE,"The boreks are just like in Turkey, wich I havent been to in 10+years but I got childhood memories eating it. And no I only had coffee that day. One of those authentic places."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTZydEN3EAE,Fresh and tasty. Will be going again to try more items in menu.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaWZPZGxBRRAB,"Used to be great a while ago. These last few years have mostly gotten cold/hard borek whenever we went to get some. They did heat up in the presser but was not long enough or the borek was way too cold. Bottom line, was not fresh. Very disappointing.  I find the one in the market has much better chance to be fresh"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNzhmSE1BEAE,very rude customer service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaXVDWUJnEAE,Oh my gosh the gozleme here is SO good! I come here every time I come into the city and DAMN it never gets old! Keep up the good work!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleXA2d093EAE,This one is a Turkish food gem specially when looking for fresh & value for money.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGJxVHJBRRAB,Girl at the front should be more careful with the hygiene. She was taking cash and serving food with the same gloves.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybkpXa1B3EAE,Great boreks.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnVmeU9BEAE,good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbllPMWFnEAE,Grilled for a few seconds and found meat in a vegetarian gozleme.. very average
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeU5ianNRRRAB,delicious for breakfast
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOTZiQlNBEAE,"Had tried this place in pre-covid days, when i loved it. However, now it didn't taste as good. Tried the spicy lamb & vegetables gozleme. The lamb had a very subtle flavour but was overall quite bland. Not spicy at all and quite soggy with the filling breaking apart on every bite, so a bit messy and hard to eat on the go. It had too many onions rather than other vegetables, so if you are a fan of onions you might like it. But would suggest to try other flavours, if you are visiting or the borek instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXNqWF9BRRAB,The only thing I look forward to when visiting Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbTlMcml3RRAB,"Usually fantastic, however today received a cheese and spinach Borek clearly refrigerated from the previous day. It was placed in the grill for 5 seconds and the cheese will cold and hard. Not fresh. Disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaWV2QzBRRRAB,"Delicious food, lovely staff, quick and fair price! I love this place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHX1BHOG5BRRAB,Very rude staff and below average food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bExmeWVBEAE,"The roast pork omelette rice is amazing. As a Cantonese person growing up eating this in my local Ëå∂È§êÂéÖ, I was shocked at the quality of the dish, since it even trumps the one I had back in Guangzhou. Would recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdi1Dcm1BRRAB,"I just ordered a fried rice, and the food was served very slowly. There was no one in the store and I waited for 40 minutes. It was very salty, greasy, and not tasty!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN2NTanVBRRAB,"Not bad, value for money"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHNTMVZBEAE,Always good. Service great and reasonably priced. Food is excellent.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobThTclBnEAE,"So disappointed with the food, waited so long for the food and it tasted so bad. And not to mention the service was terrible as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUxYNndBRRAB,Has to be the worst food my family has ever been served  and disgusting service Will never go back there and will tell everyone we know to steer clear I wish I could post pictures of the burnt slop we got served
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNHZidmJBEAE,"Delicious cuisine, friendly staff, comfortable dining. Highly recommend, thank you üòä ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybW9XQ0pnEAE,"Went for dinner as we ran out of places. After going inside, beside the tiny space the menu was surprisingly easy to read and it had pictures of the dishes which made it even easier to decide what to get. We ordered spicy stir fried beef set which came with side and rice. My partner had the sweet and sour chicken set which was absolutely amazing. Food came out so quick and you could tell it was all made fresh as you can see through the kitchen. All the food looked exactly like in the picture and the taste was just mind blowing. We ended up clearing the plate üòÖWould definitely recommend. went back again, service good and food just wonderful!  Recent update- New staff I guess. Customer service is horrible. We normally get what we want from menu and not ask too many question. Just asked a simple question as if they had sweet and sour chicken in set menu. To my surprise, the lady server was rude and almost yelling at me saying no and that it doesn‚Äôt come with side. The question here wasn‚Äôt about sides but more to do with set menu or comes in smaller portions. Lucky enough the guy standing with her understood and pointed at the right item.  Really upset with how she poorly behaved with us. It wasn‚Äôt even busy at the time when we went and we were the only ones there. Need to train new staff. This had been our go to place but having a second thoughts now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCODl5bWRnEAE,"Delicious food, friendly staff, good service!  Wanna try many dishes and will definitely come again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeGMySGx3RRAB,"Had the roast pork omelette with rice; 1. came with char siew instead of roast pork, 2. portion of meat and egg was small, 3. taste was bland. Service was good, but sadly not this dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCanZpZlVnEAE,mapo tofu was delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeDhqOU1nEAE,Nice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM1lMZXdBRRAB,"I don‚Äôt recommend this place if you are hungry. Waited more than 30 mins when there were just a couple customers in the restaurant. Food was ok, nothing special. Bit over charged. I will remember this place not to come back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCalpta3FBRRAB,"The food was awesome but despite this we were disappointed by the service. The 10% surcharge was understandable but we expected normal service. We are a group of eight on New Year‚Äôs Day and we came to eat. With us was an old lady who was vegetarian. We ordered some vegetarian fried rice for her but it did not arrive. Everything else arrived steadily but when people later than us started receiving their meals we went to inquire further. They started denying their mistake and only after a long time did they accept it. We understand there was only one cook at the time but it is not acceptable. By the time it arrived, she was very hungry as the rest of the food was non-vegetarian. Still, the food tasted awesome."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeXJpWFJBEAE,"Not the cleanest, but the food is great. Pork dumplings in chilli oil for sure üå∂ ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMHBqZHlRRRAB,Waited over an hour for meal. They kept saying 10-15 minutes repeatedly. From observations they were prioritising online orders
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMHFqdU93EAE,"We waited and waited.  The typical answer they kept giving us each time we asked was ""We are cooking your dishes now!"""
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMXVyWVBnEAE,"We were waiting a while for lunch (at 1.30 pm on Tues) but could be because the one chef was run off his feet! The chicken corn dumplings and pork omelette were tasty but the standout was a sizzling hot pot with eggplant with garlic chilli sauce. Crispy skin and balanced with salty, sweet tangy and chilli flavours...I could taste a touch of hoisin sauce. Delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaDZHMmJ3EAE,Very good in food and services. I  strongly recommend üëå

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eVBTQktBEAE,Definitely the best malatang I‚Äôve ever had! Petition to open a David‚Äôs in Sydney please!  The food was all fresh and the broth was delicious and spicy. Loved the diy sauce area :) Really cute decor and friendly and helpful staff too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbV96d3JnRRAB,very good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTRYWEJBEAE,First time there. Staff thinks we know what's going on when we don't. Lol. Soup base taste like instant stuff and the mala chilli seems like a bit of paste added on top.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScy1TM19BRRAB,"The service efficiency is super slow, obviously there is a seat, and the waiters are all busy dealing with other unimportant issues, which makes customers queue up here, and the queue of five or six people has to wait for more than 20 minutes"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3JmejVBRRAB,"The saleswoman with glasses had a bad attitude. Give a girl two bites of food, and start showing face if she asks for more. I have already politely said ""please"" and ""may I?"", so why do I throw emotions on customers when I am so dissatisfied with the work? Are you the one who opened this store, and your salary will be deducted for more rice? It is natural for customers to be hungry, who wants to eat if they are not hungry? A foreigner came in later and offered to say that there are a bunch of stores that can earn points. This attitude change is ridiculous üòÑ"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnEyX3l3RRAB,Orders spicy pot for stir fried dry pot. But pretty sure mostly they are boiled and mixed with sauce and brought out.  Feel like the food quality not as good as before. Last few times were also not as satisfying.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHJLdHRBRRAB,Way too overpriced for what it is
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc29TeGtnRRAB,good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3NtT2FREAE,Friendly and polite customer service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDV5T013EAE,Service attitude is very bad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc19hY1NnEAE,Very good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2VtSnFBRRAB,Stir-fried pork loin is fishy and hard. Stir-fried heart tube is also not good. It tastes like bean paste. Stir-fried fat intestines and cauliflower are slightly better.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnMyUHJBRRAB,Food was quite nice and portion was huge. I don't find it very cheap tho
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDktX2p3RRAB,"I bought a takeaway on the delivery platform and picked it up at the store. The app showed that I would pick it up at 4:30, and I waited for 20 minutes at the store before they started making the meal I ordered at 3 o'clock. The pick-up time on the mobile platform is inaccurate. Allow at least half an hour for the time difference."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGNudS13RRAB,a bit salty...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGVxZU5BEAE,Very authentic and delicious

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoenQyd2tnRRAB,"Things taste good, the price is a little expensive. The resident singer at night is very powerful, he can sing Dont Cry of Guns and Flowers. The restaurant has been created with a great atmosphere, not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoZ0pQRFZ3EAE,"I went there twice, and every time I went there, the waiter was ignorant, as if she owed her money, who would be in the mood to eat this kind of person even at the front desk! The second packaged meat is not as fresh as the first time, it is really badüëé"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcDZmeWZBEAE,"As soon as I came in, I greeted the front desk, but the front desk foreman came in for a long time and ignored the answer. Slowly said that I would sit inside and not lead, which would affect the mood of eating. If I don‚Äôt like to do it, I‚Äôll go home and show it to someone. The waiter‚Äôs attitude is very good, and the front desk will return it to her. Is it casual to put it on the front desk for a long time?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtamVLSlF3EAE,Mandatory scan code
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcnJuelF3EAE,"The taste is average, the portion is average, so be it. I feel that the Northeast restaurant opposite Clayton Harbor Supermarket is better than his."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcl9QczNnRRAB,"As a non-chinese person who has tried a handful of Chinese restaurants, I'd say the food was really good. I tried one of the cold dishes ( Sechwan style chicken in chilli sauce). Although the taste was nice, I reget it. If I had to order again I would pick one of the hot dishes. The service was not great. Seemed like there were only 2 people serving, waiting the tables, and taking care if the payments. Also we booked a table for 6 people who were coming from different countries, but they didn't let us pay one by one! That was hilarious as we weren't supposed to see each other any time soon after that night but they made one of use pay for all!!!! Then we had so much difficulty paying back to that person as that was the last night we were seeing each other! Another thing was that the photos in the menu were quite different from the ones served. We actually couldn't recognize our foods. The waitress seemed to be a shy girl who could hardly communicate with customers unless they were Chinese."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdzYzdm53RRAB,Order some proper food on the menu which is not cheap but supplied very quickly with pre-cooked FAST food. Do not go there for a proper food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbmMtU2pRRRAB,"The lady at the front desk is very nice, very nice"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd0pxZXhnRRAB,"Chef are you there? I ordered pot-wrapped pork, but I didn't know that I thought that the batter was wrapped in pot, and it was hard. The pork is so thinly sliced ‚Äã‚Äãthat the skin of the pot-wrapped pork after being fried for a year will be broken."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla1lMaXh3RRAB,"Terrible customer service.  I waited for my food for 30 mins and asked them about that, the staff said I should at least expect 40 mins waiting.  It used to be okay food but the people are rude. If you don‚Äôt want to ruin your mood, never go there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXI2WTRRRRAB,"I called the store last week and ordered 8 vegetarian dumplings and 1 sauce stick bone. When I went to pick up the goods on Tuesday, I said: I have not received any orders, I am very disappointed! But it should be the proprietress of the store, who is very nice! I sincerely apologize continuously! He also took out all the vegetarian dumplings in the hard cabinet, and gave us a copy. We will help you next time...their vegetarian dumplings and other things are delicious!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOElqZGpBRRAB,Hotpot was Nice. Highly recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlME51NlJREAE,cheap priceÔºåReal delicious China northeast flavor. you wont miss it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NzlIcTF3RRAB,"Nice good, great staff. Great place to get together"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bzlTNDdnRRAB,good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a3YzbjVnRRAB,Beef brisket soup for lunch not the best decision... Meat was too hard and not tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Xy1uWU9nEAE,Very good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M0lmMzd3RRAB,"Low quality food with intense flavours, low service and sticky tables. Maybe suitable for the poor undiscerning uni students?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlck1pZk1BEAE,"Quite impressed with the quality and quantity of the food. I ordered a volcano chicken ($11.90) today as the chef said it was the most spicy one on the menu and it was spicy and then some. I'm definitely going to try the other items as well!  #2: Bang J Pork Noodle ($11.90)  #3: Crispy Chicken Rendang ($11.90)  #4: Grilled Fish Rica-Rica ($11.90)  #5: Crazy Rice ($12.90)  #6: Sukiyaki Cabe Ijo ($12.90)  #7: Salted Egg Chicken ($14.90) It was fine, but I expected something different."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbzdDdGx3RRAB,no more bala-balaÔºåso sad ÔºàUpdatedÔºâ bala-bala coming backÔºågive you back 5star review
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDlycmd3RRAB,Very small tight restaurant and greasy messy environment. Food taste is good but portion is little for the price. Mee Goreng is like a glorified Ibumie instant mee goteng.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocnZLdzh3RRAB,Personally I didn‚Äôt like the noodle (Mie Ayam/Babi) that they offer. It taste bland with strongly-dominated of pepper. Maybe I will give another chance later for their rice bowl. Hopefully it will taste good! L
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocnVqWXVRRRAB,rice is not cooked yet
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHMycFpnEAE,"Yumm!! Tried the fried chicken today for the first time, wow!! Will be back :-)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLWNEbG9nRRAB,"I chose the 22üî™ set meal for myself! tasty! There are chicken, beef, fish, chicken skin and cheese!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMweGZMVzBRRRAB,Quality is different from 6 months ago. Yesterday bought 3 servings. All were given 'karak/dry' rice. I regret paying dearly to buy karak rice. Not recommended anymore.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlamQ2eVVREAE,"Very ‚Äòstreet‚Äô vibe lil shop, looks like it‚Äôs not about to last if I‚Äôll be honest, their soft serve machine was just a place holder for their cleaning materials‚Ä¶ Not flexible at all with their menu, and well you don‚Äôt go to a food truck type store for the service, our food was sitting there on the sill from the kitchen to counter for so long I wanted to go grab it myself, and the girl was scrolling through her phone, cutting up food, walking around, until she realized oh this is their food‚Ä¶. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Look food wise is not bad and $14 is fine, since the food was fresh, the migoreng noodles were handmade freshly cooked as I saw her put it in, not the dried ones but fresh noodles so it had extra bite, but everything else was just poor. We asked what was good and how the menu worked and the girl at the counter said to me ‚Äúyou just choose‚Äù"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjlTOXpBRRAB,"Good rendang taste even at Indonesian tounge of mine :) the steamed vegie though is really clean no salt lol. Rendang on rice was $ 10.5. The fish though is dominantly spicy so i wont recommend that. I believe the business model serves the students lifestyle, cheap and quick service and bonus is that it's tasty. This is Feb 2022.  Came back in Aug 2022, price hasn't changed much but the quality has been compromised, just comparing the pictures, vegies are gone, meat and sauce is not enough, even the presentation is messy, very disappointing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aWZXMmRBEAE,"The most delicious part of the crispy-skinned pig is its skin, but all the skin has disappeared and only the fat remains is still called the crispy-skinned pig? crispy pork?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOXJPeUpREAE,"I am ordering beef rendang this afternoon, I paid extra money for more meat but no rice.  The looks and taste are terrible.  This is the worst rendang I have in my life."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeS11SXlnRRAB,"1 star for the crazy rice‚Ä¶the one that has the hot dog in it....they put small pieces of hot dog in it, the worst dish I have try there, pork belly dish is ok, but please don‚Äôt get the dish that has hot dog in it you won‚Äôt be able to finish it, just taste so bad I had to thrown mine in the bin after 2 bites."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNjgyQkpREAE,Food poisoning and diarrhoea after eating here
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbHFTVjNRRRAB,Very disappointed with the quality of the food. Tasted like heated up 1 week old food. Will not be returning or recommending at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybl9QaGJ3EAE,Regular size meal is not enough for a man.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydllldDRnRRAB,"Very disappointed, used to be decent. Just had a Butter Chicken that was mostly this mushy thick mash potato textured thing, guessing it's either batter or chicken fat. (Was not the cheese) ü§¢ü§Æ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya2FpSVhREAE,"Charging for a new price with an old menu, then say the new menu hasn't arrived, but we are charging you the newly elevated fee anyways. Going large is a total scam; for $3.90, change the size of the bowl and call it ‚Äúlarge‚Äù. I mean, I wouldn't mind paying the money but be ethical if you want to run a restaurant or any business. What is the purpose of a restaurant when you can‚Äôt even feed your customer enough? I went large because I am hungry, not because I am rich. Also, Crazy rice has sausage with the skin on. Come on. This can't be Indonesian cuisine, right? Sorry, but I hope your stall remains small."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvaEt5R3pnRRAB,"Been coming here since 2018, I love this place! Personal favourite is Indonesian Butter Chicken and Crazy Rice, also love that they offer brown rice. Staff here are always friendly and nice!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdW9MYkdREAE,"This place used to be good during lockdown for its cheap price (when you have coupons), and I used to like the pork belly here.  But now the quality is very bad and unstable. The pork cracker on the pork belly is hard rather than crispy. The sukiyaki beef sticked together rather than thin slices, and has a smelly taste of old meat. The worst part: that evening after eating the meal, I got food poisoning. Reconsider before buying a discount voucher of this place"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa2Fpc2hRRRAB,Food was delicious and quick. Clean place and friendly staff. Surprisingly cheap!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScjV5VThBRRAB,"Damn, you can't say anything when you're closed down, and I'm running away in vain"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc0lfZE5BEAE,Place is closed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX2JYZlBnEAE,"The taste is alright, but the food is not fresh, I don't know what to put in it, I have eaten it three times, and every time the whole family has a stomachache and pulls hard, and I order takeaway barbecue meat, but the dog in the family will not eat it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbG9EVzRnRRAB,When we went there for dinner the restaurant wasn‚Äôt ready to serve. No menu and system was so disordered. We have been waiting for a long time to get our order even later than others came later than us.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dlkzWDhBRRAB,"Customers are able to dine for both hotpot and skewers. Heaps of selections to choose from for both skewers and hotpot, broths were tasty, highly recommend the gizzard and chicken wing skewers. Nice ambiance and affordable too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd0kyVl9nRRAB,"Great atmosphere, and amazing food. Nowhere else in Melbourne can you get bbq skewers AND hotpot in the same place. The skewers we're perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned. The hotpot selection was also excellent! Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldzdUaGFBEAE,Attended in June and was fantastic. Booked online and attended yesterday to find it closed by the landlords.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcGJiRUtBEAE,"They no longer do hotpot and have moved. Did not update their website and are still taking bookings. When we arrived at their restaurant, there was a landlord notice for breaching terms of lease. Please update your website and communicate more clearly on whether you are still doing hotpot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbVktcEdnEAE,Recommending to try on this place. üëç

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjlqdXVBRRAB,"The environment is very good, the taste is very good, and the service is also super good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcV9tS2lBRRAB,"Good food, good environment. Just that if you can't speak Chinese you're at your disadvantage. The waitress couldn't speak English. Asked if any soup base is vegetarian, one of the staffs suggested Beijing lamb and mushroom soup is vegetarian. However, mushroom soup tasted chicken in it."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOExDVjZBRRAB,Very recommended. Lamb skewers and special pork skewers are the best. Hotpot produce all fresh.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb0tlZ3NBRRAB,"So bad that we asked for our money back and left. NO service even after getting up from the table and requesting the waiters attend on several occasions and talking to the front desk. The table next to us stated that service was terrible and helped us order online. Almost an hour later our hot pot didn‚Äôt work and the food was not able to be cooked. No apologies, no retribution, no service. Fortunately no issue to get our money back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d01fT0tREAE,"My mate Stu was so impressed, he gave it an 11/10. Took pics and all. Will be back for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamNlakJnEAE,The best Thai restaurant in Melbourne in my humble opinion. All of their dishes in on point. Literally delicious I can‚Äôt wait to comeback and try more. The som tum was really good the only problem not enough üòÑ The mango sticky rice was perfectly sweet and creamy and the mango was ripe ideally. The price is good overall maybe the quantity can be a bit improved specially with the sticky rice and the fried rice. Very friendly staff this is a plus.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanZ6dVVnEAE,"The meals are tiny. After spending over $50 on food for myself.I had to go out and buy some more food as it came in infant size containers. So what is the point. The food was not very good either im afraid. They seem to charge more and give less. For clarification, I didn't want any food from your restaurant as I mentioned.  The food was not good. Why would I want something I thought was bad. That doesn't make any sense. I called to let you know why I was going to review your food and service. Now you have shown yourself to be even worse. I dont think you should get upset with the customer that tried to let you know, since it was your bad food. Good luck in the future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOW9tdmpnRRAB,Good food for a good price. Great place to meet friends regardless of group size. Service was quick and friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeU03Y1dREAE,taste good üëç
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTh5TmJnEAE,"Pad Thai and mango sticky rice were delicious, although the dessert was a bit expensive. My friends ordered red curry, tom yum noodle soup and fried rice, and they enjoyed their food too. The dishes were well-portioned and decently priced. Will definitely be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXJfV2FnEAE,Absolutely delicious - fresh and full of flavour. Service was exceptional with knowledgeable and passionate staff. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodzlycVRREAE,As a visitor from Sydney best Thai food I've eaten and excellent service. Definitely recommending.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURody1UMGNBEAE,"The food is good, the prices are a bit high, the service is very good. Large space There are cool tables outside. Five central locations, opposite Public Bath. From the restaurant location, walk along Swanton Road to Flinders Station.  Nearby Hotels: Ibis Melbourne, Mercure"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob0oteUN3EAE,Food was very tasty reasonably priced and also had a bit of variety
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMDdMX3pnRRAB,"Update: The service was amazing the other day, when I ordered a plate of fried noodles (pad kee mao) with chicken ($17.90), at level 5 spiciness! Really loved it.  The braised beef noodle ($16.90) from the chef's special menu was delicious, the quantity, optimal. With sufficient berf slices and beef balls it was very well made, and piping hot! The reason I'm deducting a ‚≠êÔ∏è is due to the very slow delivery (there were very few customers) and the table I was on was sticky (and so were the nearby ones). Although the staff were good, I wish they'd be more proactive in delivering the order and checking up on seated customers (I observed this with another couple). That being said, I'd still visit this place because of the food is worth it."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCa3N6cWJ3EAE,I love it! Definitely will come back ! Service very good too .. they have huge selections for the menu. You could choose a la carte options or Thai bbq .. Worth to give it ago  Came back for the second time and I tried the pad Thai and the calamari .. both very good ..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZy1QeUVREAE,"The waitresses were friendly but food took 20 minutes to come out. The mains were ok but the coconut icecream dessert was so overpriced, $10 for what was essentially a scoop of icecream and some pickled jackfruit. There are much better Thai so-called street food joints in the CBD."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN2JpZWl3RRAB,Very nice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2M2dklBEAE,"Delicious food, very good Thai taste.  Moo-kata at this restaurant also has. If you are Thai people, I recommend you to tell the taste of Thai people. Convenient to travel, located in the free tram zone, down to the tram stop RMIT"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2U3aVdnEAE,This is the Thai taste that I want.  I always miss home when eating here.  The quantity and price are reasonable.  The staff is very smiling. I love it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzZfdk5BEAE,"Food is not as good as they look but it was ok. I personally like the kingfish , prawn toast and the waguy char siu beef. But not the crab noodles. The oyster and the bao was fine."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLS0yUTFRRRAB,"Went there for my pre birthday dinner. Food was lovely, customer service was superburb. They even offered a glass of prosecco and small dessert free of charge!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE1LYnFRRRAB,"Had my wife's birthday dinner here. Wonderful service from the moment we stepped in. Complimentary birthday sparkling and a delish chocolate mousse for dessert. Very attentive team. Their cocktails and teas are sooo good üëçüëçüëç.  Ambience is 10/10 with a great playlist of songs, excellent layout and overall just a good time.  Only comment is we had (which is well within nitpicking territory ) is that the food could have been better. It's good food don't get me wrong but if they improved it abit, they'd be the talk of the town. Great work to the team üéâüéâüéâ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScF9mTndRRRAB,Food was excellent! We chose the banquet with wine pairing and the wine went very well with the courses. There was ample food without being over full. We felt the price was excellent for the quality. We will definitely return.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNTdDdmpnRRAB,"Walked in for dinner right before Easter. Was fortunate to be able to grab a table. Was slightly disappointed that we weren‚Äôt able to access the usual banquet menu. However, have to say that the food was good, all unique in its own way. Reasonable portion size. The service was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNS1EUVRnEAE,Delicately prepared dishes with exceptional balance in flavours. All the dishes are beautifully presented.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGZLM29nRRAB,"Enjoyed a fantastic meal with my partner. Everything was outstanding, especially Kingfish and the prawn toast. Highly recommend for a good night out (date night) in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWMtOXBBRRAB,"Had dinner at Laurus recently.  Was really happy with the quality of the dishes that were offered on the digustation menu.  Five of these dishes were of the highest quality and definitely worth going back for - the kingfish, boxing chicken, diving pickles, crab roll and prawn toast.  Equally cannot fault the wine selection from the Ma√Ætre d'."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGV2TjZRRRAB,"Amazing experience. Their take on modernising Chinese cuisine was flawless, prawn toast and beef ribs are a must. Cocktails were awesome as well along with their recommended local sweet wine for dessert. Staff were extremely knowledgeable and attentive - ambience on point too!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk9td2p3RRAB,Very good food and drinks! The atmosphere was lovely and the staff were really friendly I had the Green Forest Bruschetta which was delightfully savoury and salty
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE5hVUN3EAE,"Ordered Garden congee, many ingredients inside, good for winter time, somehow the pickles created a strong taste that clashed with other favor whereas it‚Äôs merely my personal preference. Chai is good, with honey on side without asking. Some tables left uncleaned for a long while after guests left perhaps due to understaffing. Overall, it‚Äôs good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2Z5RHR3RRAB,"Delicious brunch, coffee and matcha.‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmYyekJBEAE,Had a cup of coconut latte and garden congee. Great experience for coffee but the congee was too spicy and too peppery.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGI3S3l3RRAB,"It was my first time here. Unfortunately, the menu had little to entice me in the way of savoury food for lunch, so decided to try the Winter Hotcakes, which came with fresh pears and apricots and a whole lot of other things that, to my taste, didn't really add anything. It wasn't too sweet, yet too much carbs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWEyTnJBRRAB,We loved the food here. They were so pretty!!! and delicious too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVlqUFJnEAE,we liked the smash avo and the french toast that much that everyweek we were going there for breakfast but now they took it out of the menu‚Ä¶ so disappointed üòî ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa29laWJBEAE,Really like the winter menu
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTZUUGR3EAE,"Enjoyed brunch here with friends - we got the chicken waffles (delicious with a nice side of vinegary shaved cabbage to help cut through that juicy chicken fat and maple syrup), seafood soba (nice and light with a yum sauce) and classic eggs benny with a not so classic asian spinoff topped with kimchi plus pulled pork.  Presentation was great and service was fast. Would definitely recommend as a cute brunch spot!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTQtNmh3RRAB,Very nice Cafe and great and friendly service.  Food and drinks were so good too! Me and my friends have a lovely time here! Must visit üñ§
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTRfSWh3RRAB,"Very friendly staff, excellent service and yummy food üòÜ, definitely will come back again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScV9lZnZRRRAB,Very friendly service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScV9pUE13EAE,"They were busy during long weekend but fast service. We have the soft shell crab and the drink option are fantastic. Everything is delish, great atmosphere and coffee"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczdxVklnEAE,"Came to Soul Soul purely for the bottemless brunch and I had a few things to add  PROS  The cafe is beautiful with a quite and lovely ambience, the staff were helpful and attentive and their cocktails taste great!  CONS  They seem to have made a few adjustments, in my opinion. Everything was completely different from how it had been advertised on social media.  Arrived¬†at 2:30 p.m. and told I was there for the bottomless brunch. I was given a seat and the menu till the staff arrived and said they stop serving the bottomless brunch at 12 or 12.30 ish? This is no where to be found¬†on their website. Although the staffs said they would be pleased to serve me till the cafe closed, this did have an effect on the orders.  THE DRINKS  There were few alternatives for ordering drinks, especially cocktails. I had seen many people on TikTok come for the bottomless brunch and order margaritas or even pina coladas, but when I arrived, there were few options available.  There was little effort made into the beverages when they were served; there were no decorations; they were simply mixed and placed in glasses. I was unable to get the final cocktail on the menu as I was told that the drinks machine was shut off. Overall, it was confusing and disappointing.  THE FOOD  I order the cold noodles, and while the presentation is stunning, the flavour is very bland. I thought I was having a salad. Since it was Easter, I paid a total of $90 for one person (the holiday rate was $11). And, to be completely honest it was definitely not worth the price.  Overall, my experience wasn't terrible, but it didn't go as I had hoped. I'll give it another try next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMF9YV2FREAE,Great coffee and super friendly staff
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2RybDV3RRAB,"I‚Äôm always so unsure whether I get a savoury and be sensible or go crazy and get a sweet dish. When I saw the French Toast here, temptation took over and wow. As you can see from the photo it‚Äôs visually stunning. It had a lot of flavour and great texture so I was very pleased with my decision. I also got an iced matcha which was also very yummy. If you‚Äôre in the area, definitely give them a look."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHFxc2tBRRAB,Absolutely great. Love the atmosphere. The food is excellent.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNkthQ2xnRRAB,"Ordered French toast and a lactose free latte, came out relatively quick considering the amount of customers. They‚Äôve also quickly made a new cup of latte after I pointed out the latte was off, the new cup of latte tasted great. French toast was just okay. Really enjoyed the ambience and the playlist."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNEx2R2VREAE,Unfortunately the bread even after heating up for the second time was stone cold. Along with chilly chicken etc. We couldn‚Äôt eat it as the bread was too hard. They were kind enough to offer us a free dessert as we waited for over 30mins and we really wanted to like them but unfortunately this problem should be reflected so improvements can be made. Thank you nevertheless.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMy1IYmp3RRAB,"The food is expensive and service took forever to deliver scrambled eggs on toast with mushrooms - forty minutes after ordering when the rest of the table had finished their meal. A pot of tea is $6 with an extra $1 for milk. With so many great cafes in Melbourne, I wouldn't recommend this one."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoenBxRHlRRRAB,"The bottomless brunch at Soul Soul costs $79 and includes one main dish from the brunch menu, one serving of fries, and unlimited alcohol, including cocktails, red, white, sparkling, and ros√©. The bottomless brunch has five cocktail options. Cocktails are around $20 each, if ordered indiviudally, so it's recommended for those who can drink three or more cocktails choose the bottomless option. The coconut latte cocktail is delicious and tastes just like a coconut latte. The Baileys used in the drink balances well with the thick coconut milk, and the alcohol flavor is not too strong. The espresso martini has a very milky taste surprisingly, which is different from my understanding of an espresso martini, but it tastes good, just wishing that the alcohol flavor could be a little stronger. Pink Soul is a watermelon juice cocktail, and Cranberry Fizz is a cranberry-flavored cocktail. These two cocktails definitely have more alchohol in them as compared with the coconut latte and espresso martini, because you'll feel a bit tipsy after drinking them. Aperol spirit has a standard taste. The seafood soba is beautifully plated and includes shrimp, smoked salmon, and scallops. The buckwheat noodles paired with yuzu soy sauce are quite refreshing, and appetizing. The soft-shell crab sliders are very generous in portion size, my friend struggled to even finish one, it was very filling. The soft-shell crab is perfectly fried. The complimentary fries were tasty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNGZEd0dREAE,Great brunch options! Loved the fried mushrooms so ordered it twice and signature mocktail and smoothie was extremely refreshing for a hot summer day  We came back today after a year and loved the new Ago Veggie option served!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLUk2Qnh3RRAB,"Worst brunch place ever been! Food presentation in a mess, salad not fresh! BAD COFFEE!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOS1IT2RREAE,Nice food and nice service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaDVxT2FREAE,it's a pretty cafe
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LVBlQWdRRRAB,"I ordered the three-in-one, the noodles are soft and hard, and the taste is very fragrant!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScS0zWU1BEAE,"Definitely won't be coming back. reason  1 A chili üå∂Ô∏è sign, in fact, it is extremely spicy, so spicy that the scalp tingles. If the spiciness of Xin Lamen is 6/10, the spiciness of their noodles is 12/10.  2 customer service is very poor. Some people can eat first and pay later, we can't.  3 The design of the space is unreasonable, there are two of the 4 seats, but during the hour and a half of my meal, there were 2 and 2 people. Is it so difficult for you to change the 4-seater seat into a 2-seater?  4 The kitchen is unprofessional. I ordered two bowls of noodles, but only one was served. You are so careless and want us to pay first? Does it fit?  I don't know what the boss thinks, but I feel that he is a good cook but has no management ability at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2RuclFREAE,Servings are huge
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenZha3BRRRAB,"The spicy beef noodles was pungent, without a doubt. The spice was numbing, Sichuan style. If you enjoy this then go for broke and order this.  The noodle with tomato, pork, egg, veggies and chilli was the tastier dish. The flavours were more balanced with the right amount of spice. The noodles were bouncy and had a good texture.  The seating process was not the best  given the restaurant itself is quite small. Expect a wait during busy times."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2NqVURnEAE,"This should be the kind of place you can go for an efficient and tasty feed when you're hungry and don't want to spend over $20 for a meal, right? This was my (I think fair!) assumption given their vibe and reviews. I like service to be quick and to the point but this was blunt, rude, and quite petty honestly. At first, they promptly came to my table and demanded payment immediately after I ordered via the QR code. I didn't think too much of this at the time despite how abrupt it was, but in hindsight it speaks to how money-focused the owners are, and how little they care about the customer experience. Then they told me that I couldn't buy my dish by itself because it was under $20 and I was paying by card. Not even that I needed to add a 50c surcharge, that I straight up needed to buy something else or I couldn't have that dish because it was too cheap. Being really hungry, I added a $10 dish. When I asked for a takeaway container, considering all the food I now had, the waiter insisted on a 50c cost, and then a 50c surcharge for paying by card. Definitely won't be back here. Stingy owners and service, and absolutely ridiculous to not accept card."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd2N6U0RREAE,nice delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSekpfM01REAE,"so so underrated, 3-in-1 is a must-try"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeElxS1FnEAE,Amazing noodles!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDZ6R0hBEAE,The food was bland. they were rude as and tried to over-charge me for a can of coke (sneaky) They also have a picture of dictator Xi jinping in the wall üëé Would never come here again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa29qVWlRRRAB,"The attitude of the waiter was very bad. I waited for a seat for almost ten minutes, and ignored you. I asked if there were still seats. There were several seats vacant, but they told me that there were no seats. I asked how long I would have to wait, and said I didn‚Äôt know. Will not eat here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoakpLLUVREAE,"The food was amazing, the spices, the soupy-ness, everything was perfect. the portion size was massive but worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLU1tczBBRRAB,Horrible attitude when I attempt to pay by card they said you must pay by card when you spent above 20$‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbmJpQlZ3EAE,"A small restaurant that serves Uyghur dishes. We went here for dinner and ordered two of their noodle dishes. Both were large portions and really savoury and flavourful. The noodles were chewy and were well coated by the sauces. The only thing I would say is that while the portions were sizeable, there wasnt very much meat in either of the noodle dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcmRXSGNBEAE,Liangpi and Roujiamo are unpalatable
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaFBEVHB3RRAB,"The attitude is so bad that I came in and said that I want to eat, and I can't swipe my card. As long as the cash is at the door, I won't let people eat! ! !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbjlpS3dRRRAB,"Their menu is out of date. It shows wide hand ripped biang biang noodles with the traditional hot oil and chili, but they served factory made noodle and said their menu is out of date. They refused to address this is in any way when I asked if they wanted to fix this somehow."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM2JUa0pnEAE,"Not sure if the handpulled noodle was pulled by hand, given the even texture and lack of chew. Nice sauce. Okay service. Priced on the higher side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOFllVmVBEAE,"One of the Chinese girls (waitress) are extremely rude and bad-mannered. We never get treated like that as the girl‚Äôs attitude towards us was terribly bad, might because we‚Äôre Chinese as well, so she treated us differently. Never go to this place!!!!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNGFlTGVBEAE,"Terrible service, cash only"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbmNzORAB,"I don't know how to do business, many people than me have finished eating and left, and my package has not arrived for a long time. While saying that they are all served in order and serving the next dine-in first, it is really speechless, and I will never go again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLU4tcVlBEAE,"I went during the store celebration and experienced a ceiling of poor service reviews. At the time of checkout, three people ate 299.99, and two coupons were given for more than 300. The little brother at the checkout resolutely refuses to give it. You have to buy extra things to make up more than 300. I said what is the difference between 299.99 and 300? Can you find the boss? He resolutely refused to find a manager on the grounds that finding a boss would affect his performance, so he froze. It's really a gem, and every penny depends on the face of the waiter. The worst one I have eaten in Australia so far, the only gimmick is the face-changing show.  Thanks for the reply, I hope it‚Äôs best to find out before replying, I was 290 or 299.99 that day. If you spend 290, you will not ask or post. I think it's outrageous to be short of a penny, and that's not how business is done. I didn‚Äôt give a lottery for a penny, and then I ordered another bottle of coconut water for the lottery, and told me that I couldn‚Äôt swipe my credit card if I spent less than 10 yuan, and then I couldn‚Äôt buy any more because I had already paid the bill at the beginning, so I still kept it. Looking at the 299.99 ticket, I bought three bottles of coconut juice before I got the ticket for the second lottery draw. I just complained that your business idea is really outrageous, and your reply was even more outrageous. If 299.99 does not give me a second chance to draw a lottery, I should be informed a moment before I pay, and let me choose whether to buy something to make up 300. Instead of asking me to swipe the card in a hurry, and then spread my hands and tell me that this is not OK, that is not OK. By the way, go and see your posters and promotions yourself, that day was the second lottery draw for 300, not 350, can you even make it up? Open your eyes and talk nonsense"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4clBHd0dBEAE,Nice asian atmosphere with delicious food. Very hot and spicy soup. The beef is very recommended.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4akl1TGFBEAE,"Panda Hotpot in Melbourne is a must-visit restaurant for a unique dining experience. The Sichuan Mala hot pot is delicious, and the world-class design creates an incredible atmosphere reminiscent of a Chinese period movie.  There are combo set for 2,3 and 4 person , reasonable price , meal are included soft serve ice cream.  Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aklyb2l3RRAB,"I don't like to leave a bad review but we ordered the most mild signature soup and it was INEDIBLY SPICY. There was a 5mm layer of red chilli oil on top and we counted 25 VERY HOT dried chillies. The service, sauce range, menu items etc were all good, but our meal was COMPLETELY ruined because all items had to be cooked in the soup that was inedible. (I have reasonable tolerance to chilli, having traveled all through north and south Asia, India etc and never found anything as spicy as this ""very mild"" hot pot)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MVA2d2x3RRAB,My partner and I where throwing mix thoughts for hot pot in general. All we‚Äôll say is glad we chose hot pot did not disappoint
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEtfQWJREAE,"Went there for lunch today with a group of friends. the special lunch set is a real bargain. We had a group of 5 plus an one year old baby - we ordered the $139 set for 4 people and added additional dishes. The bill was at $43 per head for quality food and drinks, and we all ended up extremely full!  We really enjoyed the good hypes there - used to come here quite often pre COVID, will def be back again.  NB: - their ‚Äúextra mild‚Äù is quite spicy already as this is authentic Sichuan hotpot - it‚Äôs equivalent to Medium spicy in the other restaurants! - Got to try their new ‚ÄúSquashed juice‚Äù, which you can smash it by yourself, or ask the waiter to do it for you. It‚Äôs quite fun to watch, and the juice is amazing to ease the spiciness (life saver for hotpot!)  And thanks for the amazing food, keep it on :)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE5xN0h3EAE,I lived in Yangsuo County for a few years and Luosifen was a daily must and I was very excited to know that I could try it where I live now.  The flavour is not exactly authentic in the sense the soul of Luosifen was not 100% captured. That unique snail broth really is everything. But I can totally understand the challenge to recreate it and I am content with what I had.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNzdHaE9REAE,"It's delicious, but the price is really not cheap"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeUpTeWN3EAE,Truly the best guilin rice noodles. Very authentic.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob3RMRE5BEAE,"The old friend powder soup that I ate twice in a row was filled with water, and the taste was very light, neither salty nor spicy, far worse than before. Hope to restore the previous quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc0pUY0VREAE,"The snail noodles and beef noodles are generally not recommended, and the old friend noodles have limited strengths compared to the previous two. The beef noodles clerk said it was not spicy, but the child still couldn't eat it. It can't be evaluated if it is dried and eaten.  The highest level of Melbourne snail powder so far is still convenient packaging powder"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOTVETDBBRRAB,"Went to this place out of curiosity and wasn't disappointed. I ordered a bowl of beef rice noodles ($13.80). It was, for lack of a better word, interesting. Mildly spicy, wuth occasional stiff chunks of beef, the noodles were surprisingly tasty. The smaller bowl of soup was bland in taste, didn't feel like soup material, and I'm not entirely sure what that was for. Overall, nice staff and decent beef noodles."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjhTSkJREAE,"Delicious as always! The waitress is super nice and patient, and she even helped my friend mix the noodles herself."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtN0tDQk9nEAE,Very bad customer service. The lady was very rude. The lady in black at the front desk who went to work on October 29 had a very poor attitude and was very rude.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aTYtS0NnEAE,"I'm a gambling man so I like a rustic looking place that offers no written description of what exactly is in the dish. At least on menulog, it only says crispy pork rice noodles. So I get it. There's really no pork meat just the crispy fat but that's fine, it's great. It came with a separate broth not spicy or fishy, just a general savoury flavour, possibly meaty. Very thick noodles, not your normal rice noodles. A dark egg, if you've never had one don't worry they taste like normal egg pretty much. Some minor garish vegetable matter, one very interesting, I think it's deep fried peas. The texture is crunchy with a unique flavour. Overall it's pretty good."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlM3M2WE53EAE,"Obsessed with this place! I get the signature noodles with added tofu every time and it‚Äôs always delicious. I find ‚Äúless spicy‚Äù to be enough for spice level. The place is very low-key but great service and quality. It‚Äôs very good value, you get heaps of noodles in one serving. Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeG96SUFREAE,I tried everywhere but in here‚Äô you can try the best noodles on Earth :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNnFDbnd3RRAB,I was happy to discover this place by accident! I ordered the Signature CQ noodles with beef ($18.63) and it was very good. The pork soup base was simply delicious. The beef was juicy and along with that a good portion of noodles. If only this place was more known to people and on the streets... I'm a fan of this place. Great staff to recommend you as well!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbk0yeV93RRAB,"This small family run joint with a husband and wife team have battled through the pandemic and continued to serve us great quality Chong Qing style noodles.  I've tried all their dishes and I rate them all.  The broths are quite unique here.  Beef and tendons are always really tender.  Pork mince has a bit of wok hei on it.  It just depends what dish you order.  All the flavours are pretty different.  The restaurant is small, but it can be busy when the students are around.  They aren't back till March, so I'd say make the most of the quiet time and grab a bowl of noodles with your buddies.  Prices are reasonable, food is great.  Make their day and go and say hi."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb0tHMW1nRRAB,Very delicious food. Very reasonably priced.  Will definitely be back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb0lIblVBEAE,"Excellent food. Owner went out of his way to explain food, dietary and spice options. Definitely on the regular list when in Melbourne!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM1BfaFp3EAE,Not sure what the hype is about. This place is way overrated. The noodles tastes ok. That's pretty much about it. It's not authentic Chongqing noodles. I didn't taste the spiciness and numbingness. It's not good value either. I got 4 tiny pieces of beef. You get much better value for more than $18 somewhere else.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcktUOERREAE,Amazing noodles at this tiny shop. The original CQ spice level was thoroughly enjoyed. Happy to have found a gem.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOU5xdUJREAE,a bit plain noodles but still delicious
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCc0tPSG9BRRAB,One of the best noodle places in Melbourne! The less spice option is just right. The soup is so tasty. The beef is so tender.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEthMTFRRRAB,"This is one of my favourite fried chicken joints, I eat here way more often than I should. Great service, vibe and the food is so good! ü§§ ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVlEYlpnEAE,Loved it. Highlights were the Sonny's Burger and fried chicken.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNmUtZU1nEAE,Love love love it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWFLTExBEAE,"This place has been on my list for a while, as I heard it's famous for its fried chicken, so I decided to bring my sister here for a quick lunch.  We ordered the Sonny's Fried Chicken Burger - a spicy deep-fried chicken burger w/ zesty slaw and whole egg mayo. ($14.50), and the Crispy Chicken Burger - a crispy deep-fried chicken burger w/ lettuce, American cheese, whole egg mayo, and pickles. ($14.50). You can add fries for $1.50, but we ordered the Sweet Potato Fries ($8).  We couldn't resist ordering the 6 pieces of genuine Buffalo Wings w/ blue cheese dressing & celery ($12) as well, because, why not!  The burgers were just PERFECT, and the wings were out of this world. They have a decent selection of tap beers.  The place is a bit dark on the inside, so you should sit outside and enjoy the weather. Definitely coming back again for more fried chicken :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmVxRXh3RRAB,Someone forgot to update Google and Online. Made a booking for 1pm 8/4/23 online and got a confirmation. Drove 40mins to find it's closed. A couple of other people also rocked up having the same thing happened.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDlTaElREAE,"For some reason I assumed this would be open 12pm for lunch but it‚Äôs actually 1pm and not a minute earlier so be conscious of that but the service is certainly speedy. Easy parking of a Sunday and the rumours are true, phenomenal chicken burgers. I have to say I enjoyed the guacamole fries just as much. Absolutely delicious"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN1pyZzB3RRAB,"We had chicken, burgers, fries and mac n cheese. What a burger! Quite possibly the most tasty cheeseburger I‚Äôve ever had. Soft bun ‚úÖ Tasty meat ‚úÖ Adequate sauce and salad ‚úÖ These guys know what they are doing. I recommend visiting to try them out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3EyMUtREAE,Popped in for a quick bite and thoroughly enjoyed the vegan loaded fries. Staff super friendly and nice chill atmosphere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMU5qUkFnEAE,"DO NOT ORDER ONLINE  they charge you BEFORE they accept the order, so when they fail to do so you're stuck waiting days for the refund to be issued.  Would be incredibly unfortunate if you didn't just have 70 dollars floating around to place a new order at a more reputable business."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXIyN09nEAE,Went in for a quick dinner and we weren‚Äôt overly impressed. Sonny‚Äôs Fried chicken burger üí•üí•üí• could have done with a little more sauce and slightly bigger piece of chicken.  The juicy Lucy was just one big lump of meat instead of 2 patties. Meat was super dry but the sauce was good.üí•üí•üí•  Best thing here were the fries. Crunchy as. üí•üí•üí•üí•
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCME96cndBRRAB,"Awesome chicken, cooked fresh. A little bit of a wait at times but friendly service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtXzhmT2lBRRAB,The chicken was very moist and juicy when you bit into. It spit right back at you with the juices. Mac and cheese proportion was pretty good all in all for the price not bad.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdHJxVVlnEAE,Had the Double up beef burger with fries. All together $16.50 a bargain. Chicken was good too  Would be happy to eat here again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteUpMd2p3RRAB,"Great burger, low key chill place to have a beer"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdDZESktBEAE,"Got the ‚ÄúJuicy Lucy‚Äù burger with chips and mac n cheese. Burger patty was meant to be stuffed with cheese but there was absolutely none, no hint of seasoning or anything that added any flavour. The Mac and Cheese was also such a poor effort and even our soft drinks were flat. Most flavourful thing about it all was the chips with the bbq sauce. Pretty disappointed ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ3I2eGFREAE,"My partner ordered the spicy chicken burger in which he inhaled a chunk of hot chilli powder and began to choke. After 5 minutes of struggling to breathe, he took the burger back and explained to the staff that he inhaled the powder, and asked if he could get the crispy chicken burger instead. Reluctantly, the server sent the order off to the kitchen. About 10 mins later, the server brought out a grilled chicken burger with avocado- clearly not what my partner asked for. Only giving two stars as the service was below average and the fries were nice. Will not be returning"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNjZyUUNREAE,Best chips in. the. world. And the Sonnys burger is OOTW üçîüçüüöÄ The tofu burger is also an excellent choice üëå
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbWFLSm1nRRAB,"This place is the bomb! Excellent fried chicken and all the southern style sides you could want. We had the 8-piece along with mash, biscuits, mac 'n' cheese, and collard greens. Lots of cool beers on tap and bottle. Only wish they had a few more bourbons and ryes behind the bar as that's what I'm always looking to have for dessert after this kind of meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWNtaC13RRAB,This is one of those places where if you judged it by appearances you‚Äôd miss out on some amazing food. Feels like a humble corner pub. Seriously underrated chicken and burgers. I love the sides too especially the chips and potato and gravy‚Ä¶.. this is going to be my cheat meal regular
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla2V1WTlRRRAB,The fried chicken sandwiches are dope. The cheese burger is fire. The chips are crispy and fresh. Sonny‚Äôs is awesome and it‚Äôs always great dropping in here when I‚Äôm in the city. Will always be a regular.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX3RTa09REAE,Goated
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnVhZXJBRRAB,Pathetic cheese burger! I felt like I am having McDonald‚Äôs cheese burger. The patty was so thin and not cooked properly .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MUp1U21nRRAB,"Unfortunately, the quality of the chicken burger changes every time I come, sometimes very tasty and other times the chicken was burnt or had a thin size.  But in general good staff and good food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDVqSS1BRRAB,We dined in and the food was absolutely amazing. Service nice and quick even during peak hour! Would definitely come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzVta2FREAE,We looked after.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3JDb3FRRRAB,"The restaurant provided a disappointing experience. We ordered take away for two main dishes and a drink, but after waiting for 30 minutes, we only received one item due to staff error. One of us had to leave hungry for work, which was unacceptable. The level of service and disregard for customers' time was disappointing. We won't be returning to this restaurant and don't recommend it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM0w3X2NnEAE,When we online delivery to our place the soup got spill because they pack horrible and they didn‚Äôt pack my drink
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzVmY1lnEAE,One of the most tasty Vietnamese places we have stumbled upon in ages! And super reasonable prices too.. just wow. Will definitely be back for more delicious meals. üòåüëå

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNXFlTFNREAE,"Great value for money. Staff are helpful and the food is great. Unusual tasting pho, but it‚Äôs from a different region. Lovely."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHNuajdRRRAB,Nice fresh pho near Melb city. Cosy restaurant. Don‚Äôt feel thirsty after drinking the soup. Reasonable price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOElxWVB3EAE,üëé ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOE5TQlZREAE,"Nice little place..food was excellent..we had the Curry Laksa, Combination fried rice, Spring rolls, Grilled chicken with rice and Satay chicken.."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWU2TzNnRRAB,Amazing pho and rice paper rolls. My go to place for Pho!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoM05maUZREAE,"This place needs to do better. Some of the food is decent (emphasis on some), but the service is dreadful. Inattentive staff, poor customer service, regularly confusion with orders going to  wrong tables, staff asking customers to repeat and clarify their orders long after they've paid and waited - all of these things have happened without fail on every occasion if have dined in over the last few years.  Recently I had lunch with my partner, she ordered the Bun Bo Hue (BBH) and it was honestly putrid. I remember not enjoying it myself last year but this was something else. Feedback was immediately provided quietly and without causing a scene.  No more than 2-3 spoons of broth were consumed.  While settling the bill the manager refused to take any responsibility, pinning the blame on our palates (my partner is Caucasian - little did she know that I am of Vietnamese heritage and an avid BBH lover - as is my partner who also lived in VN for 3+ years. No apology, remedy, replacement, or refund was offered.  If your food is so bad it is outright rejected and barely touched, AND you are notified immediately... the wrong thing to do as a business is to do nothing at all. Simply not good enough.  Pains me to pin a negative review on a small business but I've been an infrequent customer for a few years and they need the criticism - especially after in person feedback was outright rejected."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoekoyZ193RRAB,NEVER AGAIN!  Worst Bun bo hue I ever had and very poor customer service .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzhLWmVnEAE,Yummy curry laksa and Pho!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaWJ5SFJBEAE,I love their special tea served. Pho beef tasted good too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocHVmOURBEAE,"It's almost the same as the rice noodles I ate in Vietnam, and the taste is good. Great place to eat after going to Queen Victoria Market (The fried wontons are also delicious)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa3J5UDNRRRAB,Best pho in North Melbourne!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoak8yT0dBEAE,"Very nice Vietnamese restaurant. We had beef combination pho, some vegetarian spring rolls and grilled chicken noodle and it was really good. I like the chilli oil the most, it‚Äôs just so good. Service was friendly and price was reasonable too.  Definitely recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMElDQTZRRRAB,"The first meal I ate because I was hungry for soup as soon as I arrived in Melbourne. The rice noodles were very soft and it was really delicious! And I highly recommend the stir-fried rice noodles. It tastes like scorched rice (?), but it was so delicious. The only thing is that the beef in the rice noodles smells a little like meat! I ate deliciously, but my friend ate it once and didn't eat it. It would be nice to refer to it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNjdIamRnEAE,"I rate their Bun Cha,   And the beef in vine is crack!    Cute place and nice staff :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdzRXUmhBRRAB,Duck rice paper rolls are amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbllULXB3RRAB,It was one of the best Pho...

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNTh5b3RBRRAB,Great feed for a reasonable price! Would definitely come back again :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmVhM25RRRAB,All you can you eat Korean BBQ. Order all the meats and they bring it out slowly to allow you to cook and eat. Food tasty and staff friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWJqNHVRRRAB,"Cute restaurant, the food was great and the staff was lovely and very attentive. Worth the money by far, I recommend you get everything."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWRXMndRRRAB,"I love this place! It's nice going to a Korean BBQ restaurant and knowing what you'll be paying before you get there with their all you can eat option, so you dont have to stress when you see the menu. The quality and quantity is amazing, I cannot fault the food, but my favourite things about this place is the service. It's so easy to book a table and they even sent me a thank you message the day after, not because they were asking for reviews or something, they are just so polite! üåü The staff are also just lovely while you're there, they come and check on you often without being too much, and they always smile and chat with you if you want, they don't seem too stressed by their work like other places. This kind of service is rare nowadays"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2F2SUJnEAE,"The best Melbourne Kbbqs. Affordable price and good quality meats. Best corn cheese, fried chicken, pork belly. Friendly staff."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXVubVJ3EAE,"Came to this place because all the other kbbq places was booked out in the area. The customer service was extremely rude and this not how you should be treating paying customers. Went to their bathroom and it was a size of a shoe box, the restaurant was filthy and highly will not be returning to this place. Thank you next."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODVXZC13RRAB,"It's too expensive, and I couldn't judge the menu because the price wasn't written."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN2ZiSi1BRRAB,"The Bulgogi Beef and Spicy Pork tastes amazing above all meats! The staff were very nice. Above all, two people having 3 marinated meats and 1 non-marinated meat, plus soft drinks for just $80 is beyond awesome!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX09hVlFBEAE,So delicious and great quality meat I feel like this one is better than the Ssam Korean bbq the workers are friendly food feels like heaven the BEST
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoekxQaHBnRRAB,"How good is Korean bbq. This restaurant is located near Queen Victoria Market.  We ordered a mix of plain and marinated meats, chicken wings, kimchi, broth and vegetables. Every flavour was delicious and to was enjoyable to cook everything on the hot plate while also enjoy the fresh ingredients.  Shoutout to the corn cheese dish which I could stop eating haha! I loved how it‚Äôs was slightly sweet and a nice relief from the other spicy flavours.  Definitely keen to return to this restaurant soon!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTVUa1VREAE,"Little Africa Restaurant in Melbourne is a hidden gem for anyone seeking a truly authentic Eritrean culinary experience. The daily platter for two is a fantastic introduction to the cuisine, offering a variety of dishes that are bursting with flavor and texture. Each bite is a journey into the rich cultural heritage of Eritrea, from the tender and juicy lamb to the aromatic and delicately spiced lentils.  Arguably one of the best things that I've had the pleasure of shoving into my mouth orifices, the platter comes with injera, a traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean sourdough flatbread that is soft and spongy, perfect for soaking up the delicious stews and sauces. While deceiving at first glance, portions are extremely generous, we had the daily platter for three people but it could easily feed four, making it an excellent value for money.  The restaurant itself exudes warmth and hospitality, with the friendly and attentive staff adding to the overall experience. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, creating a sense of comfort that makes you feel right at home. Overall, Little Africa Restaurant is a must-visit for anyone looking for an authentic and delicious Eritrean dining experience."

The injera is really good and is a nice contrast with the other dishes. My personal favorites were the ful and the fish curry. Would definitely recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMThQSmNBEAE,"I learned about this place by complete accident back in 2020 because of an incorrect food delivery. It was the best ""mistake"" to ever happen.  This is now my go to place for korean fried chicken and I crave it every week. Their wings are to die for, I always get soy garlic and sweet chilli half&half. The soy garlic flavour is so good and I haven't found anywhere else that can beat this place.  The kimchi fries, pork kimchi stew and tteokbokki are also great!  The store is cosy with a great homey atmosphere and the owners are extremely adorable and kind. Do support them!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3RHaHB3RRAB,"Been to many Korean fried chicken places in Melbourne, but Chickilia is still my favourite. The hot soy garlic chicken and kimchi fries are always great. My comfort food. Although food can take a while because there's not many staff, it is well worth the wait. The shop is small and generally pretty quiet, but makes for a cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOXVpOUp3EAE,"The BEST CHICKEN WINGS in Melbourne guys !!! My friend suggested me Chickilia few days ago and I decided to give it a try. It‚Äôs a cozy and welcoming restaurant to be honest. The owner was super friendly and nice to me. Waiting time is a bit long but I promise, it will absolutely worth the time. I ordered 20 pcs of chicken wings, 1 kimchi pork belly soup (included the rice) for take away. The aroma from chicken wings was seriously divine, along with the garlicky flavour. But what actually amazed me the most was the crunchiness of it. The chicken wings still crunchy after an hour (cause I had to grab some stuff from supermarket). If you haven‚Äôt tried Chickilia, please do and support them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobFBTeDR3RRAB,This is the ultimate fried chicken. Highly recommend
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobDZXWW93RRAB,The best Korean style fried chicken in Melbourne!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOWFUM2hBRRAB,"Even though it is my first time eating authentic and original Korean Fried Chicken,  do not overlook this store for another plain Korean store. I have overlooked this store more times than how many fingers I have in both hands. The Chicken is made with love and care for us normal people but made by hard-working Korean people behind the counter. Each bite you take from that Chicken that you order, you will never forget the feeling of getting the same Chicken from other chicken stores."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMWRMbmtnRRAB,"Is your boss really like this? I really need to make money. why don't you guys I really wanted to eat delicious chicken that day. The chicken I ate the most when I came to Australia was the chicken I made.. Everything was expensive and there were only dry chickens or chickens that were the size of a snot.. But on this day, I really wanted to eat what others were doing. The reviews were so good that I remembered that I should try it next time, so I ordered it half-heartedly... At that time, I asked for it to be delicious in my order. I made a pathetic request because I wanted to eat chicken so much... I don't know if you confirmed and replied to Yorocom. When I received it, I just laughed. The second taste makes me laugh again It was really delicious. Please don't change it „Ö†„Ö† I think it will become my favorite place...‚ù§Ô∏è Please prosper for a long time Please stay...‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OUtmRjlBRRAB,I have been ordering from here for 4+ years and it is consistently amazing and are my favourite wings. Chicken is incredibly crispy but moist inside and the garlic soy is the best I‚Äôve had. Always order extra. Thank you!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldThIZEJBEAE,Best Korean Fried Chicken in Melbourne. Would love to see more stores open up as I'm barely in the city so can't get these often. Great flavours of chicken wings

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOWVmZzdBRRAB,"I've been to multiple korean fried chicken joints. Nene, gami, bon chicken and beer and a few others. None of them compare remotely to this one. Chickilia is hands down the best and most underrated korean fried chicken in Melbourne."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNWZyY1FBEAE,It was really yummy and the lady was really nice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOW9hUzJ3RRAB,"This is actually the best chicken place in Melbourne. Forget the rest, come here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPekpua0d3EAE,"We rounded it up, it was 4.5. We waited for a long time because they were severely understaffed, but the food was great and staff was friendly.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPek42MmxBRRAB,One of best place for Korean food!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeU1LWl9nRRAB,"Absolutely love the family atmosphere here, just like walking into a restaurant in Korea.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdU1PbUlBEAE,"Without a doubt the best HSP in the city. Ended up going two nights in a row.  Serving sizes are reasonable and generous. The large is a large (2x burger box), none of this round container of sadness BS, they‚Äôll even wrap it in foil for you, a surprising benefit as the cheese properly melts by the time you get it home.  Meat to chips ratio is exactly what you want. The chips are correctly salted and crispy and the meat is similar to what you get at other places but they actually cook it properly and it comes out juicy and tender. Oh, and they don‚Äôt charge extra for cheese, because that would be sociopathic.  The star is absolutely the garlic sauce though. It‚Äôs obvious they make it themselves and it‚Äôs a damn good recipe, light, refreshing and tangy, cuts through the heft perfectly.  If I were to sum it up, it‚Äôs all the ingredients you know and love, but it‚Äôs prepared and arranged perfectly which makes it the best. If it were up to me, his would be the HSP specimen I would choose to put in the royal archives."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0l6MFRREAE,"Confessions of a Takeaway Addict: Late-Night Scrolling Only Leads Me Back to This Kebab Shop  As a takeaway addict, I have spent more time than I'd like to admit exploring the world of fast-food options. In the wee hours of the night, I often find myself scrolling through UberEats, searching for the perfect late-night snack. But in the end, I always come back to this unbeatable kebab shop.  Believe it or not, there's another kebab shop just a minute's walk away from where I live. But when it comes to quality and consistency, this place has them beat, hands down. I've ordered the mixed kebab combo more times than I can count, and the quality has never wavered.  Oh and the chippies! These babies are crispy, golden nuggets of potato goodness that have the competition beat. Perfectly seasoned and made from fresh potatoes, their chips always arrive hot and crispy, which is more than I can say for the other kebab shop's chips that are sometimes not so fresh, dampening the overall eating experience. In the great chip showdown, this kebab joint's chips come out on top almost every time.  The service is truly outstanding. The staff have even left notes expressing their gratitude for our support, recognising us as regulars. Their attention to detail is evident in the way the food is packaged ‚Äì the chip box is not sealed shut, ensuring the chips stay hot and crispy without getting soggy, and the drinks are placed on the side to avoid contact with the rest of the food, keeping everything as warm as possible.  Whatever your reason may be, if you ever need some late-night sustenance, do yourselves a favour and give this place a try ‚Äì even if there's another option closer to home ;)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODdHRkRnEAE,Such a wonderful experience!!! From the moment we arrive the staff were lovely. Food delicious üòã Definitely I will come back again! ‚Ä¶

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDdQVmlBRRAB,The best Kebab place in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTZTblRBEAE,"The Halal Snack Pack (HSP) was truly a masterpiece, and arguably one of the best things that I've had the pleasure of shoving into my mouth orifices. For those unfamiliar, a Halal Snack Pack is a popular Australian dish that consists of hot chips (fries) topped with marinated meat, usually chicken or lamb, and covered in a variety of sauces. I recommend getting BBQ, chili and garlic. Never skip the garlic.  $20 for a large size which is a lil pricey, but its a ton of food.  The staff were friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The prices were also reasonable for the quality and quantity of food provided.  Overall, I would highly recommend Kebab Connection to anyone in the mood for some fantastic Turkish food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXb3ZUQnBRRRAB,Great food and polite service in a small space.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobzdUXzhBRRAB,The food is very good.  Juicy chicken and excellent Thai fried noodles.  The price of food is very reasonable and everything is superb.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZ2YtZUR3EAE,"Such a lovely little place. Beautiful ambience, great customer service, friendly staff. Probably a family owned and run restaurant. Dined twice here this month and it was amazing. Will come here again and again:)"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcVB2Q2lnRRAB,"The wok charred skills from the chef in Nahm Tao is the top 3 for me not just in Melbourne but in many cities I visited.  Me and my wife had been here for more than 10 visits and the chef never failed once.  We had these 3 on each visit: 1. Pad See Ew with beef The flat rice noodles are perfectly executed, the veggies are crunchy, and full of wok charred aroma and heat.  2. Chilli Basil stir fry with chicken As above without the noodles  3. Thai fried rice with prawns The Thai fried rice we had last night (Sat night) was 10 out of 10.  My wife is a very picky foodie and she never went back to any chinese restaurants that are supposed to have this wok charred as their basic skill set, thus most of their dishes are too oily, once again, it's not limited to Melbourne.  This is just our observations but I think it's worthwhile to share."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdnRmVEJREAE,"Worst Thai food I‚Äôve ever eaten. The pad Thai wasn‚Äôt even pad Thai noodle, and it tasted like they mixed it with tomatoe ketchup. There was hardly any chicken in it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtanRQN25BRRAB,"Amazing food, excellent service!! Will be back for sure‚Ä¶ Pm Frappe a must try! We are, Pad Thai, chicken chilli jam, clear broth with chicken, and a roti with peanut sauce dip‚Ä¶ mouth watering deliciousness!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ3NhRHN3RRAB,"Phenomenal food, so good I was sad when my body wouldn't let me eat any more. Will definitely be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaFByTl9nRRAB,"What a lovely Thai restaurant. Not many seating inside but they have seating outside too. We wanted to try pad thai,pad si ew and curry puff and the taste was slightly different from what we had tried so far but in a good way. The food was amazing. Service was friendly. So many items in menu. Definitely will go back to try the rest."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXBMajVBRRAB,Fantastic and most authentic thai food in melbourne. They even accommodated us just before closing and still served us great quality food with a smile. Thank you.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMUlPTDR3RRAB,"Best burger alongside Mt Burger in Melbourne.  The Wagyu Burger was an absolute winner for quality, flavour and texture. It really is the quintessential burger in my opinion if you are after a great all round - no frills - burger.  The fried chicken with the parmesan and herb coating was also far better than KFC and any other fried chicken that I have had in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bmZfYS1BRRAB,Happened to walk pass and decided to give this burger joint a try. The southern fried chicken was super juicy and full of flavour. Amazing customer service. Will definitely come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aUpUVUN3EAE,Huge chips. Good burguers
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejRmQUtREAE,My fav place for chips+burgers! I tried both the thick cut and shoe string and it‚Äôs so nice and crispy and fluffy with the right amount of salt. I‚Äôm kind of picky with my burgers because I like a lot of sauce on them and they put the perfect amount here for me!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX2RualdnEAE,"Basic buns, (that it is)  The burger was simple, and wasn't assembled all that great.  Basic buns, basic meat patty also. There's no way it was made in store. Also very oily.  Chicken tenders were ok, and it was nice to see them made fresh. Ordered 10 but after 4 of them it was same thing basic flavour and sauces.  Standard shake.  Jonny J's comment of the night, ""how dose a burger with the lot have no bacon"""
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbXZ1aUlnEAE,"Ordered a caramel super shake, was not good...very salty and not much caramel taste, it was practically whipped cream not much like a shake at all. Loaded fries were good, good portion and lots of toppings. Classic beef burger wasn't very good, slathered in ketchup, not terrible though. I personally have had many better burgers than this so a let down for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeDY3LWlBRRAB,Best burgers in North Melbourne

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaXNUNTNRRRAB,Felt like a simple burger and got that and more. Ordered the chicken burger which was exactly what I needed and a great serve size of tater tots. So glad that I went.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybFAyQkhBEAE,Just a little bit hungry so ordered a mango smoothie. He served it to us waiting outside„ÄÅ so nice. Best part though was that the smoothie was amazing. Good size„ÄÅfresh mango„ÄÅnot too much sugar (if any)„ÄÅgood tasting yoghurt. We're local so we'll definitely be back soon to try the burgers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX19tVnd3RRAB,There was a mouse in the dining area! Told the guy behind the counter and he did not react....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLVlqTWNREAE,"Unfortunately the burger was bland, no sauce evident anywhere. Buns are sub par, burger is oily to the point that you can‚Äôt taste much else, and leaves you feeling like you just ate a tub of lard. I couldn‚Äôt finish the burger, couldn‚Äôt stomach any more fatty/oily, coronary blandness. Such a shame given the good reviews that I read prior to paying Basic Buns a visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdi1fc1l3EAE,"Waygu beef with the lot is where it's at, juicy and balanced"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUpmRzRRRRAB,"Mixed feelings abt this place.. Firstly burger is not cooked fresh - in which I mean they cook to order but beef pattie, chips, chicken etc are all pre cooked and its just heated.. I can't say its how they normally serve but definitely both my burgers and chips were barely warm. (Chips were super dry).  Taste was just ok but very bland for my liking. Bun was very dry too i felt so thirsty all the way to the end, which didnt happen as i didnt finish the food.  The service was super nice but thats about it.. hence 3 stars"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaUptNHRnRRAB,"Ordered a meal through uber eats yesterday, $4.50 for a soft drink got me a 600ml bottle along with my meal. Decided to order through them again today and for the same price they sent cans of soft drink instead. I called up to ask what was going on and they apparently charge the same price for cans of soft drink that they do for a full 600ml bottle and apparently just randomly give out different sized items for the same price.  What a rip off, won't eat from here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbDhta09REAE,"Fresh juice made to order, goes well with the wagyu burger üíØ ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c082S0JnEAE,This is a beautiful little restaurant that has a really cozy and welcoming feeling. My partner and I are not experienced with Korean BBQ and the waiter was so sweet and patient in showing us how to cook everything that we had ordered. The food was beyond delicious and the portion sizes were excellent for the price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXF1cWt3RRAB,We went there for lunch without booking hoping to get a table but luckily during the day it's not as busy. The staff was lovely and food was amazing. Though a little expensive but we enjoyed it. They have halal and vegetarian option wich is a plus. I loved the cosy atmosphere. üòç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHFENm53RRAB,The food was amazing! Ken‚Äôs service definitely made the experience very enjoyable. Worthy of 5 star.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnEzZkVREAE,"Favourite Korean BBQ in Melbourne. We eat here whenever we venture down from Sydney, it‚Äôs our must visit restaurant. The japchae is to die for as is the cheese corn and Bulgolgi. Icecream is so yummy with chocolate sauce, sprinkles and chocolate drops. Too fun! Service staff also wonderfully attentive. Great music too"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXZ6d0tBEAE,Great service and amazing food. Must try the soy bean paste soup and kimchi pancakes as they were delicious. I usually find it difficult to dine at Kbbq because of the intense smell but I was completely fine here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHRHNFJREAE,"I go here every time I go to Melbourne. I love the cheese corn, and the bulgolgi beef is wonderful, and the ice cream is so cute and comes in green tea, black sesame or red bean flavours. Service is always great!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHZqVUZBEAE,"Very mediocore experience, underwhelming quality for all the meat variety. Customer service is rather poor, as everything was a rush, as if there was a time limit. Would never come again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2VqYlB3EAE,Kimchi pancake was the highlight very average bibambap bowl.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXRqQkVREAE,Amazing place for date nights and dinner with friends. Ken always goes above and beyond on educating us on Korean etiquette‚Äôs and culture which we is why we always come back here. He also educated us on some Korean drinking games which was amazing with friends
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeExqN2dRRRAB,"This was such a fun thing to do, I reckon the menu is a bit hard to understand, and maybe could have a better, bigger side menu, but overall it was niceüòä ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmRtaG5BRRAB,"Put my expectation too high. we ordered beef premium as scotch fillet, short ribs and tongue, totally disappointed! spent $150 and we got scotch fillet which not fresh, we can judge from the color.. tongue which supposed to be tender and juicy, it was thin and very chewy üôÅ after had dinner I feel bloated.  sorry guys but only thing we love was just the lady staff that made me added another star. Won't be back to this place anymore"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNGNUMFRnEAE,"Rarely visit this KBBQ restaurant as I tend to visit the other 2 next door. Must admit, the food is fantastic, service is top notch and is actually cheaper than the other slightly across the road. Atmosphere is amazing and the restaurant layout is not as cramped. Might be my new go to."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOF9uWEd3EAE,New experience having Korean BBQ. Great place to enjoy with friends and family. Helpful staff who explained the process and helped with the cooking. Great range of food to try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob0xUeXBBRRAB,Had a lovely dining experience tonight. The waiter was great making sure we were well fed and he gave us an excellent service. Would definitely recommend going there! Thank you :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNzdyTml3RRAB,Good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCajdhdTVBRRAB,One of the best Korean BBQ in Melbourne. We got 3x sets of Set B. Super tasty food especially the pancakes and bulgogi tofu soup. Looking forward to coming back to try out the other sets. Seating time is only limited to 1.5hrs which  is a bit of shame but enough to go through all the food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdGJHTEJREAE,I have had much better Korean BBQ than this place. Tables were too small and seats were too close to enjoy anything with friends. Our server was amazing but another dude was angry for no reason. Food could have been good but I was too distracted by the elbow in my stomach. Wouldn't go there and wouldn't recommend for any party larger than 2 people.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNW96THNBRRAB,Amazing first korean bbq experience. Loved it! A little expensive but worth the food and service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMDlhQ1lREAE,"No longer recommended as the quality plummeted.  Seafood and kimchi pancakes not cut properly and have such poor structure that they disintegrate when picked up. They've also skimped on the seafood mix variety for the pancake.  Pork belly quality has also fallen. Meat is no longer marinated but more just splashed with marinade right before serving.  Their sides are now so bad that we didn't touch them at all, e.g: the kimchi was off, the pasta salad was bland and dry.  Poor service as well, I don't mind grilling things myself but they did not change the grill or turn the vent on until prompted.  Their only decent item was the fried chicken."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlc1BYU0ZREAE,Must try
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCakx1THBRRRAB,"the restaurant was small but had such a cosy feel and I couldn't fault the service, staff, food and price value at all. we were a booking of 8 and tables were all filled up. definitely need to book in advance for big groups. we were fortunate enough to stay until closing which was very nice of them to let us, and luckily we didn't have any other bookings after us. we ordered sets for 2 and the serving sizes and quality of food was perfect. parking was easy to find as we parked along the side streets but again depending on the time of day on availability."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd0wya3ZRRRAB,They take extremely long to take orders! They forget their customers are sitting on the table waiting to get served!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcF9udExnEAE,Amazing food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdzRmUlJnEAE,"Consistently great food and service. Ken, Alex, and the rest of the team are always really attentive through the night and ensure we always have a great time. Keep up the great work :)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUl5MElREAE,Great atmosphere and service. Delicious food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbEtyUkhnEAE,"Yeonga is a Melbourne institution that has been running strong for several years. I've had mixed feelings over the years, but fortunately experiencing more pleasant visits recently. The service has improved dramatically ‚Äî everyone is attentive and lovely. Service is üíØ üíØ üíØ  Between four adults, we ordered: -  ""A Yeonga Odyssey"" set which had LA Galbi (ribs), pork belly x 2, wagyu chuck eye steak, and scallop x 4. It also came with a full size budae jjigae (army stew). - Seafood pancake - Yukke (Korean beef tartare) - Extra rice - Soju x 2  Meat was super fresh and marinade was fragrant when cooked on the charcoal grill. Upstairs was well ventilated. Highly recommend making a booking before you visit as it can get really busy. Cash discount."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzdtampRRRAB,Service was fantastic and very fast. Food was delicious
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjctTGdnRRAB,"Incredible, couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDRQdE5nEAE,"Amazing food, amazing customer service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWVXbUhBEAE,Great food great table service!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa1pyTkpREAE,"Amazing food!! And amazing service, especially from roger who is always on the top floor.  He always made sure everything was okay and made us laugh quiet a few times.  Will definitely be back, food was incredible!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnNYYUFREAE,"I live nearby and go there all the time! Very tasty, good service and highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnNHWnR3RRAB,"We went for the option of $169 for 4-5 people and only 1 plate of meat come out so we were left quite hungry even though we order extra on a side. Paid total of $217 but we didnt feel full (me personally haf 3-4 bites of meats‚Ä¶) If only the staff let us know the portion of the BBQ is quite small then we would have ordered more, and it was not like we have enough time to order more at the end. when we ask for the birthday cake we brought in, the staff was: we have booking in 10‚Äô - instead of being helpful, so practically saying please leave instead of having a birthday cake. -restaurant was quite noisy so it wasn‚Äôt easy to have good conversation -meat quality was good, but I wish the portion was bigger and more condiments included. -OVERALL we were not happy with the service we received (staffs weren‚Äôt friendly and not a single smile from any of them from beginning to an end, we felt like we bother the staff when we request for something), plus not the best for value. SO not coming back for us unfortunately."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHByNUFnEAE,"Every time we‚Äôve dined at Yeonga, the service has always been unmatched. The staff are always friendly and very accomodating. They offered to cook the bbq meat and changed the grill when it was needed. Overall the food and service is good value."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEtYR2lnRRAB,It's not an original korean bbq haha I won't come back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSME5lU1F3EAE,"I have been to many Korean BBQ restaurants during my travels & I must say Yeonga is one of the better one, in fact, the best so far in Melbourne. It has a nice cozy atmosphere. The food is good with the meat well marinated, the pancake with the right crunch & taste & the army stew is perfect on a cold rainy night. The service from the staff is excellent, which started with the reception even helping me with a parking spot & helping us cook our meal. Top top class. We'll definitely be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0stbUN3EAE,"Nice service, yummy food and great atmosphere. Had a great time there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0xlUXV3RRAB,One of the best kbbq in town
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNzltXzJ3RRAB,good
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSel9ZMBAB,"Delicious! The flavour of the meat was absolutely beautiful and the portions of meat and hot pot of the set menu was perfect for our group of 6. The only issue I might have is that I felt the tables were a bit small for all the plates and cups we had, though they have extra shelves to store foods we ordered and staff are ready to help with cooking the meat and changing the grill. The seating was quite spacious too. Overall excellent experience and I‚Äôll love to be back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOWViZTZBRRAB,"Great service with attentive staff. The food was good, the meat were marinated well, juicy and tender. The attendants help you with the grill and they actively change the hot plate after each grill. Very unique as the meat is grilled over charcoal instead of gas. It adds a nice flavour to the grilled meat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWEtdElREAE,"Had my birthday here with friends and the restaurant was great, staff was incredible and food was so good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbVpLU1N3EAE,"4th time been here, everything is so yumüòã love their wagyu!! Mango rice wine is another highly recommend ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdHRpOFhnEAE,"First - If I could allocate stars to their soju flavour selection, it would be a 0. Only had peach, yoghurt and original.  Admittedly I have not been Yeonga for quite sometime, but always recommended them as they were one of the better restaurants to have BBQ in Melbourne. Meat quality remains very good, and their add ons of corn cheese, rice cake and I believe it was fish cake is well welcomed.  What lacked was the quality of service. They had a 2hr maximum seating but found that the staff were very slow in cooking the meat and often if not taken care of by the guests on table, would be left burnt.  This has definitely diminished the overall relaxed BBQ experience expected in most Melbourne places.  Lastly back to the drinks. I would recommend them offering a tap beer and adding more flavours to their soju.  This place is busy, but honestly there are alot of other great BBQ places around stepping up. 3 star."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXJtMjV3RRAB,"amazing, beautiful food! lovely owners"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbG83bFhREAE,Aunty at the counter is the best and they have literally EVERYTHING you would need at an Indian grocery store
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZzVHdW1nRRAB,Best
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLVBIQVh3EAE,A good store to walk inüè¨üè™. It always reminds me of India. It would be much better if it can make Assam milk tea available to the customers. ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmViSzB3RRAB,Nostalgic veg and mutton samosas are available. Fresh curry leaves and green chillies are also available along with other indian groceries. We went there to buy ashirvad atta which we can't find anywhere else in CBD. The staff doesn't seem friendly and not very helpful. The store is located near the Queen Victoria market.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtLXFtZ2JREAE,Amazing experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbnFxeV9nRRAB,"I ordered samosas, curry and some chapati for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and they were the best. Sweety made sure that what I ordered will still be of good quality before they arrive to the venue. I highly recommend them!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2RMSFJnEAE,"I used to work next door to this place and oh my goodness the food was incredible!! But moreover, the owners are the most wonderful people ever and the service was incredible. Sometimes at the end of the night we got a little curry delivery! I miss working in the area and having the opportunity to have this food! Will have to visit soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaHR6RlJBEAE,Best food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybE5LUGFBEAE,Bit expensive compared to other stores in city
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybjRpRnF3RRAB,We recently got Curry Corner to cater for a party and they were terrific! Loved the helpful advice about what to serve. The portions were extremely generous and the lovely person who cooked our food also gave the birthday girl a sweet gift. Food was delicious and everyone loved it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybC1iNU1REAE,Great place but it‚Äôs not even on the corner
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydnB6dDJBRRAB,"All Indian groceries available, literally everything. Reasonably priced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeklpTVdREAE,"I buy most of my pantry items(rice, dal, pulses, atta, etc.) from here as it fits into my student budget. Items are of really good quality. Really nice store."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdDl2MHRRRRAB,A one stop shop for most of the Indian items.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaWN1M1JnEAE,They got one of the best Indian chicken samosas and chicken rolls in Melbourne. I would highly recommend this place for food even though it is a grocery store.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcGZiNHNnRRAB,Great place for Indian & Pakistani spices & produce.  Friendly service as well. Staff help if you are not sure about what to buy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhck5LVUt3EAE,Great Indian grocery shop to have in the neighbourhood. Always lovely service. The takeaway food is great too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScklTaC13RRAB,Food was average and a little on the expensive side though the service there is amazing! Great staff friendly and very attentive
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemVqTktBEAE,I live nearby and have tried all of the Korean restaurants around but this one is my local favorite. Their pancakes are the best. I also love the samgyeopsal and beef galbi. Their octopus stir fry is also good. They are my go-to order. Don't really like their jigae though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc2JHTkZnEAE,"Easy to order from menu, happy accompanying staff and my new favourite drink is the pear soft drink!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobFo2REtBEAE,Used to be good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaHZIaUV3EAE,"Good price, great food and the best service. Almost always have tables available!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc3RPWXJBRRAB,"Rhe ambience made you feel like youre in korea, food and service was good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdDU3V1JREAE,"The quality of the meat is always best of best!! So fresh and juicy ü§§üëçüèªüëçüèª The taste of all food is closest to the taste of real Korean restaurant. I highly recommend. ‚ú®‚ú®  It's the number one place to hang and kill in Melbourne! The chilli sauce and soy sauce that comes with it are also very tasty. Be sure to add mushrooms, too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZzl1a2FBEAE,"Amazing food and service. Really friendly staff, thank you so much for taking care of us. Well be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbGNIaEZ3EAE,Best authentic and tastiest Korean bbq I have ever had. I tried all the Korean bbq places in north Melb plus a few in cbd.  There‚Äôs a lot of k bbq options in this area but I choose to go to Toodouri - every week. Number 1.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbklyNlJ3EAE,Best Korean Barbecue so far! So good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdE9UNThRRRAB,Excellent place to go for Korean barbecue with a wide range of choice when it comes to cuts and sides all at a very reasonable price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbVBxSWtBRRAB,"Great that they cooked the meat at the table, and fresh sides"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbU4tTTlnRRAB,They gave us expired rice wine
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbzZ1NGd3RRAB,Loved the food and service here!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajduMjFBRRAB,Great place for KBBQ! Good value and meat is nice! Will definitely be back again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjRTWHhRRRAB,Still best valuable K BBQ Friendly staff‚Äôs excellent hospitality Thanks
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dzVPcllBEAE,"We ordered a two-ppl set (beef, pork belly and a soup) and a seafood pancake. The food is on average standard.  What we didn't appreciate was the service  provided by the waitress and her ignorance of hygiene. The youngest waitress always put the thongs directly on the table after using it for us. I just wonder how difficult it is to put on the stove or a plate.  What surprised me the most was she even used the thongs to flip the cooked meat right after touching the raw pork. Horrific!  She was always in a rush cooking the food for us even though there was still an hour to go before the restaurant was closed (Maybe because we are the last table of customer?)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1blAtN05nEAE,"Very fresh food, better quality meats than other Korean BBQ I‚Äôve had! We‚Äôll be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzdpNnFBRRAB,Super friendly service very professional. Very clean amazing menu can't wait to come back and try the rest of the mouth ordering food ü§§ sooooo good!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDZMYWJBEAE,Brilliant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWQ2bDhBRRAB,"By far the BEST K BBQ restaurant and Asian cuisine in Melbourne CBD. Great value for the amount of food you get. The owners and workers are so beautiful and we honestly love coming here, they remember all their customers and are so warm and welcoming each and every time. Every time we have come it has been such a good experience. The meat is good value and fresh, as well as the complimentary side dishes. I couldn‚Äôt fault this place. Definitely worth visiting!! I have been coming here with my partner for 5 years and they have honestly improved their food and service each and every time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWJQQVdnEAE,Donwoori you will be happy with this amazing restaurant! I felt like a home cooked meal on a rainy Friday night and felt right at home eating some delicious Korean bbq meat! The staff was extremely friendly and the food came out straight away! The staff was attentive turning our meat on the bbq. Thank you so so SO much. My fianc√© and I will be back! DELICIOUS!!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHN1RklBEAE,"We ordered the beef set for 2 and it was excellent. The meats were so juicy and delicious, particularly the scotch fillet. The corn cheese which came with the set was really good too. We also ordered a japchae which was so flavourful and its noodles were nice and bouncy. Super kind and friendly service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU9XMk1BEAE,Have been going here since 2013 and is still one of our favourite KBBQ places. Great value and quality with really friendly staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUk3YjlnRRAB,"I liked the restaurant, l'd definitely come back. For the price, the portions are good and the staff were friendly and attentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNFBqN3Z3RRAB,"No unlimited bunchan, which caught me off guard. Decently priced for the beef/pork belly bundle with tofu stew(~$35AUD/person) authentic tasting tteokbokki. Quick and friendly service. Good location near Queen Victoria Market"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeWZ6ajFnRRAB,"Went for a family 21st, didn't warn them or anything. Friendly and super-efficient. Licensed (did the beer with soju shots). You may have had better Korean-style BBQ somewhere else but this won't disappoint. Well done people, will be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdDl1X0F3EAE,Unfortunately had food poisoning here on Saturday. Pretty certain it was because of the fermented vegetables. Was rushed to emergency hospital for two days and had the worst pain I‚Äôd ever endured throwing up with sharp stomach pains. Tried to call them to discuss but no one has picked up. Please call me back ASAP.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOUp5RlpREAE,What can I say tasty Korean! Try the seafood kimchi pancake and enjoy great marinated BBQ.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMzRla2l3RRAB,yummy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ3FXUzFBRRAB,"Incredible! I can‚Äôt comment on the bbq, although it looked nice on others‚Äô tables. We had the pork bulgogi, japchae and tteokbokki, and all were incredibly delicious. The sides were also fantastic - best kimchi I‚Äôve ever had! Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z1pySXNRRRAB,It's tasty & duper B service ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M2ZfU1F3EAE,Great price for a beef set for two at $52. It only had 3 side dishes but they were very good with refilling them.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OVltaVRBEAE,A very polite and helpful staff. Fast and prominent service. A great value for money. However I feel that eating and drinking in plastics not very environmentally polite. This owner need to think about moving to metal utensils and proper drinking cups. My partner orders a Korean beer but we wonder why he wasn‚Äôt serve with a glass to pour his beer into it? Is it an Asian believe that beer should be drunk straight from the bottle ??? Please explain.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWRpY1ZBEAE,"My go-to KBBQ, using proper charcoal is a must for me. Great value for money. Friendly staff, nicer and cozy place. Highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPXy0yd1NREAE,Excellent bbq
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb002em13RRAB,good kbbq with good kimchi
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoME5pYzBBRRAB,Hi when are you going to stop using so much single use plastic utensils and plates at the Queen Vic market???
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNXFlY0tBEAE,"Showing as open, but when arrived it's closed due to the renovations at the queen Vic markets"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX3FmZDZBRRAB,Fantastic
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNnBEZDVRRRAB,"Delicious tapas, try the sardines!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMHZubHpBRRAB,Really authentic Spanish food. Tasted like home!!! Nice staff. Highly recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOUpLd3lnRRAB,Beautiful food that makes you feel like you're in Spain. Great service and lovely atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaDZ2VzhBRRAB,"Great experience at El Rincon tonight. Excellent Sangria on tap, croqueta and paella. Shout out to the waitress who served us tonight; there is a genuine quality to the restaurant that shines in its food and atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLS1fTW9BRRAB,Authentic Spanish food with friendly staff.!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNjZ1Wkl3EAE,Delicious food and friendly service. Will definitely be back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdmUtLXBRRRAB,"This is easily the most authentic Spanish restaurant I have been to in Australia (I have lived in Spain and come from a Spanish family) Visiting from Sydney we had to try this place and were not disappointed. Every tapa we ordered was perfect, and they're also the only place I've seen in Australia that gives you a tapa with the drinks you order too (like like do in Spain).  The decor is great and authentic as well, and the service is excellent as well.  The ultimate compliment I can give is that I'm now determined to bring my Spanish grandmother down from Sydney just to try this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMVl1RHdnRRAB,Very lovely food and drinks menu! The service is great. Location is a bit of a let down. The restaurant is quite small and placed near a busy intersection.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNWZpUElREAE,Lovely food and service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdWRhVTNBRRAB,Loved the outdoor pavement seating on a warm Melbourne day. Also indoors. Great service throughout and helpful suggestions. A moderate wine selection and good value. Next time must try their Sangria. Casual and enjoyable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMlllX0xnEAE,"The service was good, friendly and accommodating.  Good guidance was provided by the waiter and his suggestions really assisted us. The wait was a bit too long, but once that paella arrived and we tasted it, all the wait seemed worthwhile.  This is probably one of the best paella we have ever had. Sitting outside is not as great as we thought though,  too much traffic noise so I would recommend sitting inside ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbHRPMjBRRRAB,"A place where they discriminate against you, the waiters treat you badly and take advantage of it to charge you for things you didn't buy. I will never come back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbHRPQ3lBRRAB,Very rude in attention. We ordered cheese and embutidos like apetizer and one paella to share and after pay we realized that they charge double (We clearly asked for only one). Food is too expensive and the service is really bad.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbHJtUi13RRAB,Amazing food! I highly recommend you try the mussels with Cruzcampo.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLXRpZnB3RRAB,Authentic Spanish homestyle food and hospitality. Outstanding value. The flan is a must!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHekxLMUF3EAE,"Great Food and Atmosphere, Spanish cuisine at its finest"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNzhyYXJ3RRAB,"Restaurant started off saying they didn't have space for us inside despite us having a booking. Nonetheless, wanted to try the calamari and paella as walked past numerous times. Was not disappointed! Calamari could have been crispier but the flavour was good.  Ordered the squid ink paella and only criticism could be the prawns, if they were bigger better - for what you pay, 55 for 2 pax.  Overall will return, but recommend booking ahead so you get a seat inside.  Not the friendliest bunch, but not the worst either..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdy1tQml3RRAB,"This place is amazing, you can get an original Spain food. I love  food, service and the the place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdmFUTXBBRRAB,Really good Spanish food. Excellent sea food paella!! Amazing croquet! And really delicious garlic & chili prawns!! Quite recommended. I'll come back for sure. Thanks for serving us so well!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNFl6NjlBRRAB,"""Best laksa in Melbourne"" i was told by the staff - far from it and it was my first since moving here. Chicken laksa had far, far too many bones, i had to spit out so much and therefore did not enjoy it at all. Please consider using chicken strips."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcklQenZBRRAB,Ordered their fried noodles with beef rendang and vegetables. Everything is very salty. Cannot imagine the other dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLTh1LWl3RRAB,"Lots of choices, reasonable prices, friendly staff. However did not enjoy our nasi lemak and char koay teow. Needs improvement to the taste"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NDlDUVdREAE,Misleading to call this MALAY food because it really is not!! The only idea pilfered from Malay cuisine is Laksa.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cUxxRGd3RRAB,Good Malaysian style food...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN011XzVRRRAB,"I love their Penang Char Kueh Teow, Crispy Fried Chicken, Vegetarian Curry Puffs and Laksa.  Absolutely delicious! The price is reasonable and the portion is big.  Definitely will go again when I shop at Queen Vic Market."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxb2N1a0tBEAE,Been my regular go when I'm after some Chinese for lunch whenever I'm down at Vic Market to do a bit of grocery shopping.  Have tried a bit of everything off their menu but the ones that I keep coming back for are the chicken curry or their satay chicken.   I think it's obvious to see I have a thing for chicken.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcnI3ckp3EAE,If I could give it 10 stars I would. Excellent food and great variety to choose from. It's so fresh and delicious. Also wonderful service. Also they make the Best Char Koay Teow in Melbourne hands down.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxX0t2RUJ3EAE,Consistent delicious food and generous serving sizes! Always My go to at Vic market.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxX0p6cC1nRRAB,Amazing food and awesome service.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdks3cWVBEAE,If you visit VIC market avoid this place as the food is not good. Two tiny pieces of beef and a piece of chicken and a heap of noodles. Bad value. Very disappointing.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNX0xucW9BRRAB,"Horrible chinese food with very stingy service. I bought two bowls of noodle.  I cannot even ask for extra bowl to scoop out hot noodle for young kid. Any extra bowl, they asked to buy a plastic container. The man behind the counter has an attitude that needs to be checked.  I could easily gotten a bowl from next shop even though I bought something small.  Pathetic service."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHF5NFBBEAE,What amazing coffee. The food is great and service is prompt. Vic markets provides the hustle bustle and character.  Well worth the caffeinating top up.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHVHU0ZBEAE,Cafe dirty
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGN6V0t3EAE,"Great cafe at QVM. Very reasonable pricing not increased in two years, however some servings may be on the small side, but still great value"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHFiMHlBRRAB,I found the non-lactose iced coffee literally undrinkable. Banana bread was fine. Was forced to sit outside as closing time was approaching. When a staff member was tidying outside I told her my drink was awful. She did not respond to me at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4X01DYmJBEAE,"We were looking for a nice restaurant around the market and found this indian restaurant. The food was really good. If you are nearby the narket, it is worth having a try."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aElDMVVREAE,"the food was so good but not only that the service was also amazing. One of the owners (lady) was so sweet. She recommended us the right amount of food (so that no food goes to waste, but the right amount that we could actually enjoy). I could actually vouch that this was one of the best Indian restaurants i have tried in Melbourne. 1. Food was actually good 2. Service was Best 3. Matched our Indian taste buds (not sweet like usual Indian restaurants, in fact perfect taste) 4. Very good presentation 5. Although we sat outside the heater helped us avoid the cold weather. Overall an amazing night at the restaurant and will be coming back whenever we come back to city for visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUpPc1dREAE,Great food and really friendly customer service. In a great location as well.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOThleWZnEAE,"The hardest thing was choosing what we wanted... everything else was brilliant.  The waiter was delightfully personable and the flavour was unreal. The yellow lentil curry was probably the best lentils I've had, packed with flavour and a nicely spiced.  A bit pricey, but you pay for what you get and more :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjVEYUx3EAE,"This was my 3rd visit in the last 2 months and every time the taste , quality and service is amazing.  A must visit place for indian food cravings."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMFlySTVRRRAB,"Have been coming here on weekdays, I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôve changed from Meet Sando (Proud Mary) and now serving Market Lane Beans. Coffee taste great, and even better don‚Äôt have wait inside QVM to get same quality coffee.!!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWF5WFVREAE,Great food üëç Nasi Rendang was spicy than I expected but still great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWUtZEJREAE,"The Iga Bakar Kecap (Angus Prime Ribs) was one of the most delicious Indo grilled dishes we've had and the Ayam Bakar Kecap (Grilled Chicken with Sweet & Savoury sauce) was also very good. Topped off with a solid choice of sambal, will definitely be back to sample more from the menu. It's not surprising this joint is always busy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWZhbGRBEAE,The staff are very courteous and excellent food. There is value for money.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWJtTDJ3RRAB,"Amazing experience! Ordered the Rendang, which came with a fried egg and sambal. The meat was very tender, well seasoned and the portion was super generous (especially stands out in this current era where several restaurants are cutting corners on quality to stay afloat).  The people near me ordered the grilled chicken leg which looked delicious....would love to order this next time.  Nice vibe in the space also."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeVp6d1NBEAE,"A great place for rich and tasty Indonesian fare. Greeted with a smile and didn‚Äôt have to wait long for the food! It‚Äôs also easily accessible - right in front of the tram stop, right next to Queen Victoria Market."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnZHT1BnEAE,Best Indonesian food so far in Melb! The satay & coffe gula aren is my fav. Glad found this resto ü•≥ü•≥
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXRmYXJRRRAB,Best Indonesian cuisine i've had so far. Authentic taste and with such cheap prices. Serve really fast and the staff are very friendly. Highly recommend this restaurant ü´∂ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnFqU3lBRRAB,"The best and most authentic Indonesian food in Melbourne. The ayam bakar kecap (grilled chicken) and Iga goreng kremes (Angus prime ribs) is amazingly delicious, the meat just falls off the bone, every mouthful is a flavor bomb. The service is fantastic and the food arrives quick!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdk1uci1RRRAB,"They have a really good Soto Ayam and young coconut juice. Their food taste authentic and similar with Soto that I eat in Bali, Indonesia. I really happy to eat there and I will comeback there soon!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSektDam1nRRAB,"Popular Indonesian with big servings and reasonable prices.  I have only tried a few dishes. The servings size is generous but I find the meat, whether in the Rendang or the Iga Groeng (Angus Prime Ribs) to be somewhat dry-ish (it does not leave a luscious mouth-feel). The sambal (chili condiments) are great - but not enough to ""wet"" the rice or meat. The tempeh (fermented soy beans) has a good nutty flavour and taste great with the spicy sambal.  You order and pay at the counter, and the meals are delivered to your table."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdU9IX2xBRRAB,"Delicious, authentic Indonesian food! The customer service is fantastic too, the staff always go above and beyond. Highly recommend!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEszQjhBRRAB,"The portion is large, and the pepper chicken rice noodles I ordered are light and suitable. When I went there, it was just meal time, and there were many people, but the meal was delivered quickly. The staff is also very friendly. Rice noodles are too soft, others are fine"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWJUd2NREAE,First time trying rice in tomato soup. Liked it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZDUWpBRRAB,"Taste really bad. The bowl looks big but food portion was tiny. Very impatient service. Don‚Äôt go there, it‚Äôs a complete waste of money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocU5idE1REAE,"Disgusting, really unpalatable, smells like oil"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdmR2MlF3EAE,"Whether it is pao rice or rice noodles, it is very oily and salty. I almost vomited to death after eating paofan and came home for a whileü•≤ My roommate was also very uncomfortable after eating rice noodlesü•≤ This quality should not be like this. It was still delicious before. . ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM2NyMHpRRRAB,Shop of conscience! The soup is super delicious and has a lot of ingredients!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZy1yMk1BEAE,"Lost in Yunan is a hidden gem of a Chinese restaurant that serves up some of the most exceptional soup dishes I have ever tasted.  My personal favorite is the Fish Mawin & Chicken Rice Soup - it's full of rich, hearty flavors, with just the right amount of spice to keep things interesting.  The bbq meat dishes are also a standout, with tender, succulent cuts of meat that are perfectly cooked and packed with flavor. The restaurant itself has a cozy, welcoming atmosphere, and the staff are always friendly and attentive.  Overall, I cannot recommend Lost in Yunan enough - it's a must-visit for anyone who loves delicious, authentic Chinese food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLUxmb2JBEAE,"I ordered the sour bamboo shoots and fatty beef rice noodles. The soup is very thick, and the yogurt and berries are delicious, but the most pleasing thing is the service! The waiter on duty at around 6:30 pm on November 18th, two girls and one brother, super super nice, can be regarded as a clear stream in the current Chinese restaurants in Melbourne üëç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdDd5T0xnEAE,Had the pork and tofu soup. Massive serves and tasty broth.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd0txSzJ3RRAB,"The service of the front desk waitress is so bad that she doesn't want to take business at all. She has an extremely world-weary attitude, and she always presses the phone to order food at work, and she looks very impatient. No wonder there are no customers in this store. This is the moment I am in Melbourne. I have never written a google review for such a bad store. Currently the only one that can force me to write a google review"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd0lLTWlRRRAB,"Very bad experience, the front desk clerk just owes him money, his mistakes are still impatientüòÖ he was speechless"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2azl5RFJ3EAE,"40 minute wait for food. The food was already done but just sitting on the table. No one did anything about it, no numbers were called. Even the waiter that took the order saw me waiting outside the door but didn't give the food. Only got the food because I wanted to tell them to hurry up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aU5XUmpRRRAB,The waiters in this store are like I owe them money. especially the guy with the glasses
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNheVktMHl3RRAB,I want hot pot crispy meat and gave me a tomato
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdjRidF9BRRAB,Doesn't accept card payment under $40

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDV2RHNnRRAB,No joke the best pork belly in Melbourne.  the budda jjigae looks white on the menu but is legit. Great amount of spam
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eU9MTDN3RRAB,Visited for the first time and I must say that their service was incredible! Side dishes were served pretty much the moment we sat down.  Staff were very efficient and also cooked the meats for us which was great! Loved that they have booths which were pretty private and an ipad to order from. Definitely one of my fav kbbq places in melbourne now.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjdiTDV3RRAB,"Very wonderful staff. We didn't know what to do, and they helped us understand the customs and what to do. Timely service, and very worth it"

We went there yesterday and just couldn't get around to go there again tonight before we have to head back to qld! If we could we would take Kim...the restaurant and the whole team with us just to make sure we could go there many more times! All diffrent meats...just melt in ur mouth...the noodles...the kimchi pancakes and kimchi stew and all the other things we got to try just to die for! üôÉ If u wanna have a dinner to remember...pls guys go there and check it out it is an absolute hidden gem!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWVEYUtnEAE,"How can I describe food heaven in one word? HWADAM Lovely Korean BBQ place, after we explained that we have never had Korean BBQ the chef himself took time to explain everything in detail and grill for us. He explained traditions and gave further guidance on other food that we can try, everything tasted wonderful and we had a great experience! We will soon come again, thank you üôè"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbFp1OVNREAE,"Best first time Korean BBQ experience, my first dry off  Korean BBQ and it was a blast.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3F6X3BRRRAB,"Great Korean BBQ place with amazing customer service attention to replenish the sides.  We got the sliced bbq set, wagyu oyster blades and marinated pork belly and it was all fantastic. The sides providing were sweet onion and pickles, bean shoots, fish cakes, cheese and corn pasta, and kimchi. They have some of the best kimchi I‚Äôve ever had.  Expect to spend at least $40 per person, but $30 is doable if you split a bbq set amongst 3 people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeFBDenhRRRAB,Good food and good service. Nice atmosphere and interior.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUppSEVBEAE,"Vietnam just passed Found a good Korean restaurant upstairs.  The shop is a bit difficult to find, follow the map is correct, only go upstairs to see.  The restaurant is full of Korean style, delicious food, delicious beef.  Quick service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN0ptbUNnEAE,We had the rib finger which was cooked to perfection. Secondly the service was second to none. Very prompt service . Would 100% recommend
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUs3dG1BRRAB,"Hwadam is linked with Yeonga so you automatically know it‚Äôs good. The only thing that was different was Hwadam didn‚Äôt have a grill ring with corn cheese and potatoes etc. Food, meat quality, and service was 10/10.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodW9pcFRREAE,"You guys, don‚Äôt sleep on this spot! Sister to @yeongabbq is a new KBBQ restaurant called Hwadam Korean BBQ and grill. They‚Äôve been around for a year-ish, but they‚Äôre a little hidden - located on the end of Elizabeth St, on the 2nd level of an apartment complex.  The restaurant itself is very chic with cozy booths that resemble traditional Korean houses. It‚Äôs also super clean and modern where all the ordering is done on an iPad that‚Äôs attached to your table. The staff are incredibly attentive, proactively refilling our sides throughout the night and cooking all the meats for us. They were so friendly and speedy - legit felt like they were running to get our sides and water refills.  Between 3, we ordered: ü•© - Wagyu Combo Set [$119] - included wagyu chuck eye steak, oyster blade & bulgogi, sushi rice, halloumi cheese and mushrooms - good quality meats, and a generous amount for 3 üç≤ - Beef Soybean Stew [$17] - very beefy and hearty üêô - Seafood Pancake [$22] - their pancakes slaps! It‚Äôs one of the best seafood pancakes I‚Äôve had! Crispy and loaded with ingredients. It smelt soooo good when they brought it out ü¶ê - Soy Marinated Raw Prawns [$26] - the prawns were super fresh, buttery and marinated so well! üåΩ - Corn Cheese [$14] - cheesy with a slight crisp from the sizzling plate - so yum! üçö - Steamed Rice [3.8] - because the set came with sushi rice, you could probably share a bowl between 2  Definitely recommend checking it out the next time you're in the city for KBBQ! Follow me on Instagram @ EvelineEats for more food content and reviews x"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHFUbWlBRRAB,"Everything is ordered through a very easy to use touch screen.  Once ordered, the service is excellent, within a few minutes everything comes.  Staff regularly check and cook the meats selected and are very tentative to our every need.  Waygu Meat is excellent, boneless chicken equally as good, sauces provided top notch.  The restaurant setting itself is cosy, private as were all in booths which i love.  I've been to alot of Korean BBQs, well over 20 in Melbourne and this place makes my top 3. Absolutely amazing place and one of my new favourites."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoclAyc0RBEAE,The service was very prompt. One of the best Wagyu in melbourne.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck5EbEdnEAE,Very rude customer service. Cannot recommend to anyone.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmViTEhBEAE,We love the food here; reasonable prices and excellent customer service. We will be back next time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocThIeTl3RRAB,Very good and friendly restaurant.  6 stars recommended
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmFQSy13RRAB,"The taste is ordinary, the point is that it is too slow, waited for 50 minutes to serve, it is old and starving"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOFpPYjB3RRAB,"I had take away twice. The first was beef noodle , recommended by a friend. It turned out just allright to me it was cheap for a reason  there's not much meat in the bowl. The taste itself I prefer other shops. The second order was cumin stir fried pork, it's also just ok taste abd the meat is alittle dry, not much difference if I cook it myselfü§≠  Price is as at 13Feb2023"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoME1UOTlBRRAB,"It used to be really good, comparable standard to Bowltiful but has gone downhill. Also- if unable to provide an accurate english language menu just don‚Äôt provide one at all. The menu has options for ‚Äúextra chilli‚Äù and ‚Äúless chilli‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt want extra or less so I didn‚Äôt tick those boxes. when I didn‚Äôt get chilli I complained and apparently if you want chilli‚Ä¶well actually I have nfi what you are meant to do. Maybe you need to wish upon a star. It‚Äôs just stupid. Oh yeah, and the ‚Äúextra cabbage‚Äù‚Ä¶ that is not cabbage."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLV8yU25nRRAB,"Compared with Ganji, the price is much more reasonable, the taste is still good, and the quantity is relatively large. The package is relatively affordable, and the service may be due to frequent replacements, which is not very stable. Still looking forward to improving better!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtajdIMGhRRRAB,"Chinese noodle bar opposite Vic market serving beef broth noodle dishes, nothing fancy or extraordinary. Friendly staff, average waiting times was 5 mints. Menu is well priced, with average spending of $25 / Person. Good place for blow of noodles and Chinese snacks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZMHRfbDlRRRAB,Tasty and cheap beef noodle soup with many selection of side dishes. Their handmade noodle is very fresh and bouncy texture. Love it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtLXZxa2JREAE,the food is tasty and affordable. a quiet spot great for lunch. beef noodle soup was delicious and so were the vege fried noodles.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtc3BiTzh3RRAB,"Hate to give bad reviews but both my boyfriend and I had stomach aches after eating here. Mapo tofu $16.5- very bad straight from the sauce bottle, beef noodle soup ($12.9) which is very cheap but barely any meat, dumplings - average with no taste.  When I came in, nearly 90% of the tables weren't wiped down and cleared from dine in customers. Only one waiter working, need more staffs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbWZmeHhRRRAB,Warning. I ate here yesterday and myself and a friend both got food poisoning. We had the soup and within 4hrs were violently ill.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXNPWm5nRRAB,"Ordered a beef noodle soup with egg and extra beef combo. Only got the noodle soup, which wasn't very good in the first place. Very disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OTd1SnpRRRAB,"Good food, but the portions are quite small for the rice meals (not much meat), and I had to call double meat to keep me from being hungry.  There is only 1 staff taking orders, serving and cleaning, so sometimes you have to wait if you need anything. Floor is very slippery in the rain, if you have latex shoes, beware or you may fall."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcUl1MUx3EAE,"Beef noodle soup can add extra noodles for free, but need to tell the staff at ordering.  I feel like they definitely need MORE staff working at the same shift. I can see my noodle soup had been ready for a while but the waiter was still making the order for others and not able to deliver it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c2FpQXB3RRAB,"On the afternoon of August 23rd, I ordered a take away. I used to come here often. This time, there was a thin male waiter wearing glasses. I was standing at the cashier and he walked over slowly. Then it‚Äôs like a log and you don‚Äôt talk, how about I come to order for you? During the ordering period, I said a word and packed it? It‚Äôs awesome. Then the food is ready and packed, so I don‚Äôt say I waited in vain It took me more than ten minutes to ask myself to find out that the food is ready. Excuse me? Then I don‚Äôt ask him. Did I not know until your store closed? Wash up and sleep. Is it me serving you or you serving me? If you can‚Äôt do it, go to work in a factory. There are many fruit factories in Australia. Don‚Äôt be a waiter. What a shame!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M2VlYlR3EAE,Great taste and reasonable price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eGNLRnVRRRAB,"the taste is so ordinary There is also dine-in, because the mobile phone network is not good, I repeated two orders, and the clerk said that it will automatically refund, TMD! It's been over a week now and I still haven't seen a refund"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1anNpVU5nEAE,"Order the twice cooked pork on rice was very delicious, great customer service, will be back to try some new dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bXEzeDd3RRAB,the best i‚Äôve had in melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbGNXQ0xnEAE,Delicious ramen shop.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNVlIWnN3RRAB,Surely it's illegal to run a restaurant with no bathroom or toilet? Staff directed me to use McDonald's bathroom across the intersection.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dlAyVEl3EAE,"Their service was terrible and unreliable!!  My friend and I came during lunch hour, and the service was awful SLOW! Upon arrival, there was no one to assist us, either it be to be seated or how/where to order. They also did not provide a receipt (except when you request for it firmly) , and it‚Äôs very easy to confuse yourself with what you ordered since the names of their dishes are difficult to remember. When they serve the food, they placed one dish in front of us and we had to wait for another 30mins before the next dish is served, and this was after repeatedly asking them for our food. There was no proper sequence in delivering the food as the customer got ALL of their dishes before us (and finished it) despite ordering later than us. Imagine you have a 1h lunch break and 40mins was wasted waiting for the food, it‚Äôs frustrating.  Extremely unhappy with this restaurant and I will never come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTZYcWxBRRAB,"Great atmosphere, and to be honest, great food. However, second time here and second time disappointed with a couple of things. Whilst I know this is supposed to be cafe concept, the price for a normal plate of nasi or pan mee is alot higher than your conventional malaysian restaurant. That wasn't the problem, my problem is the amount of sambal they gave for the nasi lemak. It is probably 1 tablespoon at most and any Malaysian would have agreed this is wayyyyy too little. We asked for more sambal but they charged us 3aud extra for another tablespoonful (on a little saucer) of it. $3?? Really?? I don't think I am being too brutal but if you were to get this amount of sambal in Malaysia or even Melbourne, would you even go back to that stall?? Another issue I have is the lack of vegetarian options. Needless to say, we weren't that happy and will probably not return. I usually don't write any reviews but this really left us reeling and I have to put it out there and hopefully the owner sees this and be a little bit more generous with their sambal for their future customers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbl9hN2p3RRAB,"I had an absolutely fantastic experience dining at this Malaysian restaurant located between Melbourne University and Victoria Market. The spacious seating and beautiful decor provided the perfect atmosphere for enjoying the delicious food.  I ordered their specials-only dish- Hakka noodles which was mixed with pork mince pieces, and it did not disappoint. The noodles had the right amount of springiness and their crispy fried chicken also had a unique vinegar taste that made it stand out. This dish also reminded me of Sarawak style kolok mee. I also ordered a simple sunny side up egg on toast with a side of bacon, and it was a simple breakfast dish cooked to perfection. The edges of the egg were crispy and the bacon was nicely fried and charred. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for authentic and tasty Malaysian cuisine. If you're around the area, it's definitely worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDZETHVnRRAB,"Food is delicious, service is ok, ambience is quite nice. Malaysian fusion food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGRQdFVBEAE,"Nice food. Very nicely plated. Everything looks so pretty. The cook on the meat is very on point, it is tender, it is not dry. The curry is fragrant but not over spicy. The chili on the side is for people who want to take the heat up a notch. The side salad is also really fresh. Hope this little gem garners more attention."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM3FmOWpRRRAB,Superb for morning coffee and friendly smiles!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3FuNjlRRRAB,Great food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocThyaTRnRRAB,The food is amazing. The Laksa is really light and fresh - nyonya style - and they also have delicious Pan Mee. The coffee is also one of the best you'll get in the area. Very personal and friendly service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmIzajVnRRAB,"The proprietress is super nice! Moreover, the dishes I have ordered so far are delicious no matter whether they are eaten or drunk, and I don‚Äôt think they are average or bad at all! ! Because the proprietress who comes here often will also chat with us recently and invite us to drink coffee~ The rose-flavored latte that he invites us to drink is also super delicious, looking forward to it on the shelves soon!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmUybGJ3EAE,sooooo good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoanYtN3Z3RRAB,Great food and coffee. Cool vibe.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek9LWEpREAE,"Excellent service and great food! The staff was so kind, bringing us soda water with ice when she saw my partner sweating for spicy food. Will definitely recommend this one!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod0t1dTdRRRAB,Dined at Manja recently. Excellent coffee. Family owned cafe with a friendly vibe and meticulously prepared food. Highly recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNHVIOXNRRRAB,"I had the laksa for lunch on Tuesday and it was so yummy ü§§, will be back to try out other dishes"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNUs2dGRBEAE,"This cafe is situated within the same building as what seems to be a student accommodation. The menu is primarily Malaysian dishes with a couple of standard western style breakfast dishes. The nasi istimewa was decent, the fried chicken was crispy but missing some herbs/spices that would elevate the dish more. The pan mee had this great broth that hits the spot especially if you have it for breakfast. Service was slow to come out although it wasn't busy which is okay for us but if you are in a rush keep that in mind. Food - 7 Service - 6 Vibe - 7 Price - $$"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbjVEOWxRRRAB,"We tried this cafe and didn‚Äôt know it is a Malaysian. It is also family owned and run. All the dishes looks great from the menu.  I tried the Nasi Istimewa with curry chicken and the burger. Both were really nice. The dishes tasted homemade, gave me homey feeling. Everything was well-balanced in flavours. I just wish that they give extra curry / sambal in the Nasi dish.  Overall, the food was good but imo it is quite pricey for the portion (comparing it to other Malaysian cafes). I will come back next time to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZy1lM2xnRRAB,"Came across this cafe when trying to find one open in early January. Really friendly staff and tasty coffee with a ever so subtle sweet aftertaste. No bitterness to the coffee as I‚Äôm not a fan of a really bitter flavour as some people are, so highly recommend this place"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCb29tbTVnRRAB,Food is amazing! We‚Äôve tried so many dishes there over repeated visits and it‚Äôs on point every time. We wish it‚Äôs also open for dinner! Derrick (the owner) is a warm and friendly host and his wife is the talented chef behind the authentic Malaysian recipes with her own twists. Support this family run restaurant - we thoroughly enjoyed our experiences there.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcmJhMVNnEAE,Great coffee!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla2NmalhBEAE,"A caf√© that offers a select number of Malaysian dishes at prices that are above the norm.  Nasi Istimewa is just Nasi Lemak with a fancier name (Istimewa means special). I ordered the beef rendang version ($22) - the platter also has rice, crackers, bean sprouts, cucumbers, egg and sambal (chili & spice paste). For me, what makes a really good Nasi Lemak is the sambal. It has to be said that the sambal is really good - well spiced, with enough chilli heat to excite the palate but does not overwhelm. The rendang is good - thick nutty sauce with meltingly tender meat. I missed having anchovies with my nasi lemak (which costs $2 extra).  The Hakka noodle ($19) is plainer looking. Mince pork with noodles and a lonesome stuffed beancurd on the side. Hakka is a ethnic group in China that has its own distinct dialect, culture and cuisine. If you have eaten -""chow mien"", then you have eaten Hakka noodles, except that the version here is served in a broth. The noodles is really good - smooth and ""slurp-able"",  goes really well with the pickled green chilli.  Beancurd stuffed with pork/fish is a common Hakka dish. My mum used to get pork meat and ""pound"" it with the back of a Chinese cleaver until it is ""sticky"". She also includes the Hakka's secret ingredient - salted fish. The taste when steamed or pan fried is smooth, bouncy, sweet and salty. The version here - the meat taste rough and too salty for me.  I went on a Saturday - so everything costs 10% extra."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXFXRUdREAE,"Orange juice is nice and fresh! I had the vegetarian pesto pasta really aesthetic experience! I wanted to study there but could not concentrate cause the music was a little bit loud, but still is a nice place to have brunch or lunch with friends!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN0plRi1BRRAB,Good Nasi Istimewa (nasi lemak) and good Nyonya Laksa.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NmZ5cFpnEAE,"Nyonya Laksa, yum"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z2FFRBAB,Best Hakka Noodles in Melbourne. We are so impressed with the quality of food and the hospitality of Mandy and Derek. Will come back very soon and bring friends and family.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbU91NWFnEAE,Waiting for a very long time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjd6N1dREAE,tastyÔºÅ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbThydzd3RRAB,"I cannot recommend this place enough if you're in the mood for some delicious and affordable hot pot. They have incredible variety of fresh ingredients available. Whether you're a fan of seafood, meat, or vegetables, there is something for everyone. I particularly love the range of options for soup base or flavour - you can customise your hot pot to suit your taste preferences perfectly. My favourites are the spicy soup, Curry and Malaban.  And let's not forget about the skewers - they are out of this world! The meat is incredibly tender and flavourful, and they are the perfect accompaniment to your hot pot meal.  The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, always making sure that your needs are met and your experience is as enjoyable as possible.  Overall, I would highly recommend this hot pot restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious hot pot and exceptional service. It is absolutely one of my favourite spots to dine."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNm9UWXFnRRAB,Cheapest mala tang in Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodkx6aTdBRRAB,very unhygienic
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNmJQNkd3EAE,"I had the spicy hotpot ($16.97) the other day here and it was surprisingly good! The dish was piping hot, and the soup had a creamy yet spicy flavour and was very flavourful. I took the flat noodles, and they had a lovely taste of their own! The ptotein was fine, so were the veggies. I'll definitely visit this place again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa2VLbzlBRRAB,"The first time I came here, it fit my taste. It was delicious. The soup almost made me drink up. The only fly in the ointment is that the crab meat sticks are not tasty. It is recommended to change the brand of crab meat sticks!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdC11Y01BEAE,The best hotpot around
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcU1IYmJ3EAE,"busy restaurant - choose your hotpot fillings and they take it out the back and cook it in a broth for you. Delicious, but DO NOT come here if you cant handle spice !!! Even if you think you like very spicy things, prepare to have your socks blown off and your ear drums burst from the sheer spiciness of your meal. They will promise it will be 'mild', however, do not trust them lol Dry Curry was the HOTTEST thing i have experienced in my life."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMzlhUGZ3EAE,"Why is it not delicious recently, improve it quickly. It‚Äôs not like the Northeast Mala Tang anymore. I don‚Äôt make my favorite powdered mice and potato powder, and the dried tofu has become silky. My heart hurts üíî"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb2VlWllnEAE,The casserole Mala Tang is really too hot...Two bites will fill me up.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMmJPd2FnEAE,expensive and poor quality
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcktmeUd3EAE,"Malatang tastes average. The attitude of the service staff is very bad, especially the girls with short black hair. She ignored us and put the takeaway receipt directly in the dish, which is very unhygienic! ! !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1djRta0tREAE,Highly recommend the spicy bone broth. Good value and tastes amazing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjlqUkhREAE,"This restaurant has eaten a lot, this time it really disgusted me! Before I went today, I called the little brother in the store and asked if I could pick it up and change it to dine-in. The little brother said that I can just come and eat, and then I have already arrived at the store. What do you mean by giving me a boxed Malatang? Is it difficult or expensive to change the casserole? Are we underpaying or what? There are only two green vegetables in it, and the amount is less than half of the usual self-promotion. The new girl with short black hair has never seen it before. I asked her why we can‚Äôt put it in the casserole. She said that we just ordered self-promotion before. Yes, just ask what we want to do? ? ? With a bad attitude, I thought you were the proprietress, please educate your employees! At least speak with a little brain"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aVBPdXVBRRAB,"Really enjoyed my lunch here last weekend. I ordered the tomato base and my friend ordered the mixed one. The flavour was beyond my expectations and I put a lot of veggies in. Which made it look healthy and not too heavy. They also have the curry option, highly recommend to try it out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPal9iSUpBEAE,"The attitude of the service staff is good üëçüèº The food in the store looks clean and the lighting is bright But the fee for swiping a card is really high (about 3.1%) Mala Tang or Mala Mix $3.8 per 100 grams (price on 17/07/2022) The taste is normal üòÖ The sauce mixed with sesame seeds is very strong A normal bowl is about $30 But I ordered a little spicy here, but it was not spicy at all üòÖ Not even a little bit spicy (maybe I forgot to add it?) instant loss of appetite One more thing to add: there is not much space in the store, and there are about 20 seats"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMy1hQV9BRRAB,Super friendly staff Love the crunchy chickpeas
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNTZYdE1nEAE,"What a piece of crap, I ordered 60! That's all! The store sees contact me! Do you do business like this? To die for! ! Whoever goes is a big injustice! !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOWF1eGhRRRAB,Original taste in soup and quite affordable pricing very satisfying
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4X01xMFFnEAE,"Pretty pastel haven! Stopped in on a whim, and had the Insta-famous matcha dessert that comes with a little hammer so you can smash the heck out of the waffle cone. Quirky and fun, just like the Wes Andersen movies that inspired the cafe."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aU9XYmN3EAE,smash avo was disgusting ü§Æ horrible taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE1DdVh3EAE,"Super aesthetic place to dine in. Service was good, staff were very friendly and accommodating. Their Matcha Latte was good, not particularly too strong or too sweet. The Spicy Carbonara Pasta although on the smaller side of a portion, tasted amazing! The ‚ÄúEscape the Forest‚Äù was very appealing to the eyes and a great mix of flavours! Would come back for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXV5azlRRRAB,"A hyped Asian-fusion cafe that I can get behind. Definitely recommend the Mentaiko Udon! So creamy and they cooked the udon to perfection. (I‚Äôm quite picky with how my udons are cooked ahhaah)  Although it is quite pricey, it‚Äôs worth checking out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbl9iTkx3EAE,That's a lovely coffee shop ‚òï Very friendly staffs and beautiful space üòç

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUxMVGNnEAE,"Visit this cute little cafe this afternoon, me and my partner ordered a dutch baby and beef bourguinion. Although we waited for about 15 minutes for our food to arrive, it was well worth the wait. The dishes were absolutely delicious and expertly prepared, and we could taste the quality and care that went into each one.Overall, the wait was a minor inconvenience that was quickly forgotten once we tasted beef, it was really soft and tender. Was wondering whats the leafs on the beef."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbE8zTFJBEAE,"27 dollars for this ""seasonal"" beef brisket was an absolute waste of money. The portion is tiny, flavor was bland and hell the beef brisket definitely did not taste like it was braised for 7 hours. The mashed potatoes was not creamy smooth buttery but instead was rough and did not blend harmoniously with the already terrible flavorless beef. Please remove this item from the menu. Chocolate tiramisu dessert was great, lol. In general for the other order, portions are tiny, but the plates are big. Definitely not worth the price you're paying for here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoazRfbmVBEAE,Great food and coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3VTcnNBRRAB,The cr√®me toast is sooo nice Must come back for other dishes
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaGZyeC13RRAB,"If you're after a satisfying breakfast or brunch, I wouldn't recommend this place. This is more of an Instagram caf√© in the sense that everything tries to look Instegramable but lacks real soul and content. The food was ok but the portions small and pricey. I was looking at other tables and their portions looked even smaller than the ones we ordered.  Desserts looked nice but we didn't stay to try as we were disappointed with our food. No vegan options. If you want to take an item off the dish they won't replace it unless you pay and even then, they don't have any vegetarian replacement. Coffee comes in one size - small. It was ok, Nothing much. If I had to go back I'd only get a coffee and cake. Would have food elsewhere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXBlVDVnRRAB,Friendly staff with exceptional customer service! Beautiful interior design.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXNYWDZRRRAB,"Mentaiko Creamy Udon is my favorite. The combination of side dishes and udon is refreshing and not greasy, and the taste is superb.  Agatha is refreshing and fruity."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXI3Vi1nRRAB,Such a beautiful cafe
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX0k3UXh3RRAB,"Been here a couple of times and they have all been a slow service so it was expected. However, after taking our order, we spent more than an hour wait. Reason? They never inputted our order through. Thought we never ordered and pretty much neglected. Food ordered also sold out and was told last minute about it.  Was not really impressed with today especially since it was not cheap. It could totally be avoided."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN082N2pRRRAB,Manager was really clueless to fix or help our order. Overall service was alright..??
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN0s3WnpRRRAB,"So me and my friend came here and ordered the toast and udon. Firstly, they either took our order wrong or made the wrong dish but we instead got the carbonara noodles. The noodles were undercooked and very hard but also, my friend cannot eat ham due to her religion and we specifically did not get the carbonara because it HAD BACON. The way they handled the situation was horrible, it was either we wait 20 minutes extra for our udon and pay full price or refund the udon and pay for the toast only. My friend luckily only ate the noodles, however it is still considered bad as the bacon was cooked along with it. What kind of service is this??? Also not to mention we waited extremely long for our food so it would be ridiculous to wait an extra 20 minutes... we were short on time so it was inconvinient. please offer some kind of compensation for YOUR MISTAKE?? the cafe wasnt even busy, theyre just unprofessional"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoem96UVp3EAE,"Staff was very friendly! The udon was very nice. If you are not very hungry, the portion is just right for youüëçüèª"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNXRtSXV3RRAB,Avocado on the avo toast wasn't fresh - it tasted like it was out of a jar unfortunately
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNXZqcXBnRRAB,"Took 40‚Äô for my meal to be served. Then the bread was not toasted enough, still cold and chewy. Look likes i got an old bread from them. Really disappointed, this is not first time i come here but think I won‚Äôt be back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2VTclBBEAE,"Reserve only, we spent 30 min walking there and there are 4 tables at least empty and they told us is full because they only accept reservations. If you want to make us reserve, at least provide a reservation link, there were no info at any place, and refuse us in such a rude way is just bizzare"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeElxWTl3RRAB,"The taste is ok. The food was served too slowly, there were no dishes and there was no timely notification. The waiter said to help return it, but the cashier said at the checkout that there was no refund, and it has already been served? ? Don't have a small ticket and don't know at all.. We didn't complain during the whole process of waiting and eating. On the contrary, the cashier was very impatient and kept saying that we didn't return the dishes, and the communication was not timely. I ate it four or five times, the first time this happened, and it won‚Äôt happen again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMF9MRzh3RRAB,Diarrhea after eating
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWJ1TFFnEAE,The attitude is very bad. I called to ask about the available time to make an appointment. I was hung up on the phone before I finished asking. I was also very impatient when answering the phone. Can you take a break in the service industry?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMUp5RVVnEAE,"9:15pm I just told me to close at 10:00, if I can‚Äôt pick up customers, then the network will change to 10:00, then you won‚Äôt make money, just don‚Äôt open it, there are still seats inside  It‚Äôs clearly 11:00 on the Internet. If you don‚Äôt want to make money, don‚Äôt make it. This kind of attitude is really disgusting"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocmFtSEdREAE,"Excellent service and delicious skewers, they tend to be the same flavour and can take a while to make, there‚Äôs also different varieties that you rarely find in other restaurants such as testicles and tongues, definitely come here with friends who can speak and read Chinese as some items on the menu are not in English but the friendly staff can help as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWFtUUl3EAE,"The food are alright. It took some time for waiting the food. It‚Äôs quite expensive for the bbq items. Not recommended the soup thoüç≤ the customer service is not that good. Since I waved üëãthem to order more stuffs, the waiter took a long time to give me the response."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeWJfbW13RRAB,"Went there twice in one week and it was really delicious! Roasted pig's trotters YYSD is the taste of domestic barbecue. Tin foil duck blood and sixty-year-old fans are also very good. Although the waiting time is a little longer, the taste is really worth it. BBQ with beer, every time you eat it, you can eat it on the wall! The seafood cauldron needs to be booked a day or two in advance, so you must try it next time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOVlXMThnRRAB,Always a great place to eat. Great food great service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcGF2S05BEAE,"As always, the food is delicious and full of flavour"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMlkycUVREAE,Excellent service and delicious food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOGNmaFdREAE,"Delicious food, great service, comfortable environment. all good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUlPUXdRRRAB,"Dinner for 40 guests last night at Epocha, faultless service and divine food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0ptRmRBEAE,Continually and always the very best - a very special place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWN5S3VRRRAB,"The Flavours, the Ambience, the Hospitality, all play a role in transporting you on a journey and make this venue a memorable dining experience that stays with you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWZtdUJREAE,"Good but not great cuisine quite over priced.  Food was over seasoned, particularly with salt.  Service was very good - professional and engaged.  Disappointing overall."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWUtTV93RRAB,"We had our dinner before the wedding in the Maybelle room. We had 31 guests. The general ambience and elegance of the venue and the space is hard to describe. Honestly it was a dream! The food was equally amazing. It was just the best night, the balcony and adjoining bar are added bonuses that really elevate the space. The team was helpful and kind - would recommend to anyone looking for a small function space."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWVxRm1BRRAB,We had the most delightful experience at Epocha. Our server was so knowledgeable about everything food and wine and made us feel special. We had the four course option and left feeling so full we could barely walk to the car.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaElINGVnEAE,"Epocha hosted my family for a dinner and we were all very impressed with the service and experience. Before the event, they were very willing to work with my needs which I really appreciated. The service was wonderful - you know from the first moment that the team know and love the food and wine they prepare and serve. The staff took familiar flavours and elevated them to an impressive standard. Everyone had a different favourite dish and the atmosphere was comfortable and beautiful. I felt like I could relax and let them take care of everything. I will definitely be coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk5HNnFnRRAB,"We have dined here many times and yesterday I had my Birthday lunch - 9‚Äôof us and everyone was so delighted with the food, wine and services.  LOVE it all. Thank you team ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèº"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUlha1hREAE,Small family business. Staff greet you like your their family. Fantastic food. Fresh food and some of the best wines
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1lyV25RRRAB,"Great food, great service. Thanks for acknowledging our birthdays, made our night extra special!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNXY3NEV3EAE,"After a day at the Melbourne Flower Show we decided to have a last minute late lunch and visited Epocha, due to it's close proximity.  What a pleasant surprise this restaurant was with not only delicious food beautifully presented, but the service was superior with a super friendly, knowledgeable and professional team.  Love this restaurant and will definitely be back - a lucky find for us!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNW83cVRnEAE,"Great service, food and all round dining experience."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTdDY3h3RRAB,"Excellent service provided by all staff members! We had the pleasure of meeting the Chef, who enthusiastically shared context regarding a particular dish.  And dessert was delicious. Our waiter provided a tailored service. The atmosphere was relaxing and inviting. Thank you! Will be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaF92Y3FRRRAB,Amazing food and amazing staff. We were there for a birthday party. The whole event was beautiful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocThpZU93EAE,"Amazing night at Epocha. Beautiful venue, awesome food and the service was top notch. Definitely worth it and good value. Well done guys.  Extra star for going over and above...‚≠ê"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoazhuWEZBEAE,"Had a fantastic experience at Epocha restaurant. The staff were very friendly and personable, the food was phenomenal, and staff made sure to accommodate for dietary requirements with absolute ease. All in all a great experience, highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobGZYT0hBEAE,"Wonderful venue, fantastic food and attentive staff.  I would give 10 stars if I could!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWR5ZV93RRAB,"Food, service atmosphere always great"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMUptWEZ3EAE,Europe at Melbourne's doorstep! Super tasty food in an elegant setting. Everything on the menu is finger lickingly tasty. We were 3 adults and ordered the 4 course menu. The amount of food was more than enough and we could not finish everything.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNE5xNkRnEAE,"The venue is so pretty and overlooks the park, the service/staff were lovely and we had a laugh with them. The wine was great and the Sunday Roast was so good - especially the bread and duck fat potatoes!! I‚Äôll definitely go back for it. Only complaint is the website mentions the Sunday roast comes with pasta but it doesn‚Äôt - might want to update it :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleDVEdlhnEAE,"Great food, excellent service and good wines. Thanks for making us feel ‚Äúspecial‚Äù."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOS1YZzhBRRAB,"Fabulous food, service & setting!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtd3BPbFJ3EAE,"Wonderful experience dining under the trees yesterday, generous and creative food and wonderful service as always. So glad Epocha is in our lives."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4clBHUFlnEAE,7 eleven meat pie better
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c092blVnEAE,"Nice staff, pretty decent food and a good atmosphere. Overall nice experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b00ya21RRRAB,"Great place, love coming here. Sparrows is delicious, and the beers at catfish are always a great selection."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnA2eXBBRRAB,I had the Buffalo Wings and the regular Cheesestake. The wings were too soure to eat all. The Cheesesteak was very small and it only tasted like old cheese. Dont go there when you want to eat a good Cheesestake and good wings
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaG9fSGNBEAE,Went in on a Friday night. The place felt more like a nightclub than an actual place to eat. Ordered a Philly cheese steak with peppers it was honestly not bad. The prices for the cheese steaks not so much. Very busy had to wait a while. Definitely not my scene too many hipsters.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeF9HR0F3EAE,Although it isn‚Äôt always consistent when it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmREcjhRRRAB,"Really good flavor, as the Philly ones. Fast service, not to friendly but is understandable considering they are super focused delivering a prompt order. Chips r massive so are great to share. The down side its the price but these days everything is expensive. Super recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGJ2bGVREAE,Best American cheesesteak I have found in Australia. Almost like you get in Philly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnBLNXpRRRAB,From welcome to thornbury food truck. Disgusting processed tasteless. Not only that the amount of salt on the thin fries were enough to kill a small child and not edible. The workers didn‚Äôt care less either.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXF6VzdBRRAB,Very VERY salty cheesesteak and quite expensive as well
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdklYNTJnRRAB,Amazing American food. The pumpkin pie was home made and delicious. Great food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdExXcG13RRAB,The food is great!! Had the best chicken wings of my life here!! Chese curds and the Cheesesteaks are a must try!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX2RtV2l3RRAB,"Amazing place, look no further if you require high quality philly cheesesteaks that's cooked fresh to order. The special fries are also amazing and crunchy. Top place üëå"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmJUaF93RRAB,"Great staff, nice place. Comedy on Tuesdays is great but do not get the vegan tofu cheese steak"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3JMMDl3RRAB,Poor service and no warning of extremely long wait time for food from food truck at ‚Äòwelcome to thornbury‚Äô. 1 hour+ and counting. Staff said it‚Äôll be 2 minutes on two occasions. Will not be eating from this food truck again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTZ2SUZREAE,"would be pretty nice but the lack of fillings in the philly steak sandwiches was pretty poor, just all bread and no meat"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLU9YMGh3RRAB,One of the few spots in Melbourne that makes cheesesteaks.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcHNtcTJnRRAB,Everything was so good here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMk8yalFREAE,Amazing service and tasty food  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4akpyZ3pnRRAB,"The focaccia bread is amazing, and so is the Wagyu tartare.  Excellent service and drinks.  A little bit pricey, but still worth it for a special occasion."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTRuYXNBRRAB,Excellent food and service. We were seated at the bar in the kitchen. Chefs were friendly. Food amazing. Order the lentils and mushrooms! I‚Äôd recommend here for dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2NmQzV3RRAB,Perfect
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHVyQ2RnEAE,"The food was delicious but unfortunately the service was lacking which made the dining experience not as enjoyable as I had heard. I had asked for something and yet it wasn‚Äôt conveyed to staff and I had to go and ask myself. Very slow during the night leaving plates there for a while but when it came to the bill and getting us to leave they were very fast, did not feel the hospitality at all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0lIQTVBRRAB,Cannot wait to go back. LOVE.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDl2LW53RRAB,Stumbled across this little gem by a wonderful accident. Authentic Italian menu that tastes as good as it sounds. Unpretentious food done really well with great quality ingredients. The team are lovely and the service is fantastic! Will definitely be back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemUtRkxBEAE,"Staff went out of their way to accommodate us, awesome food!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXJpNU5nEAE,"This is a true gem in Fitzroy! With authentic Italian food, and the fun European flair, you are transported to a trattoria in Italy, whilst in the heart of Melbourne. From delicious pastas to mouth watering meatball subs with fresh ingredients, and served by friendly staff, you'll leave satisfied and looked after! And be sure to get the soft serve icecream to end on a sweet note, you won't be disappointed! Grazie Rocco's!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUxqQWJBEAE,Ooft that was one hell of a meatball sub!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ09feXBBRRAB,I really enjoyed our lunch here. Had the meatball sub and it was quite superb. The bread roll was soft and fluffy whilst the meatballs were tender and flavoursome.  Really nice venue with very comfortable upholstered booth seating.  Come hungry because the sub is very filling!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1lTUTB3RRAB,Wouldn‚Äôt go back. Size of meal was like an entree. Very expensive. Was very disappointed in the red wine pulled from a tap. Latte was almost cold.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoel9tSDBnRRAB,Came for the Rocco's Meatball Sub and stayed for dinner. Cool venue in the heart of Fitzroy!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaS1mMW1BRRAB,"After seeing photos of their meatball sandwich for months I finally visited Rocco‚Äôs with my friend, and we weren‚Äôt disappointed!! It‚Äôs the best meatball sandwich I‚Äôve had! There was a slightly smoky flavour that really made it. The fries had really tasty seasoning. The staff were friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeFlmM3h3RRAB,"After dining here a couple of times, I chose to host my 30th birthday in their event space, Vince‚Äôs Bar. The coordination and service that I received from Jody was exemplary and all of my friends said so as well on the night. More to that, the space, food and vibe was perfect. It was everything I wanted my birthday to be so thank you so much!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbzlia3l3RRAB,If you a looking for the best that Italian cuisine has to offer this is the place to go. Great staff and good vibe.üëç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbzdTeTRBRRAB,One of the single-most greatest Italian food experiences that I have had the pleasure in indulging in the past 5 years. Thank you Rocco's Bologna Discoteca.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCby1UdEdREAE,It was a pleasant experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCby1TRlZ3EAE,"Now this was something unexpected but like next level, this place is so awesome"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbzdpSkRREAE,I felt in Italy. Very pleasant atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbzVpNDd3RRAB,Simply the best
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbzlDT2JBEAE,"Great experience, I loved the italian feel"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU5MS2x3RRAB,Went for lunch at Victoria‚Äôs market and the food court is under renovation. Found this restaurant near by and it‚Äôs a truly Italian place run by Italia. Maria is the chef.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eEp6N29BRRAB,"We had a delicious, freshly made meal. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, even though it was our first visit it felt like we were regulars. Highly recommend this venue for an enjoyable, tasty meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2YtMFhREAE,A beautiful and authentic experience. Delicious food and great portions.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGMzbDZnRRAB,An accidental find whilst on a work trip to Melbourne. Nothing pretentious about this place. Authentic Italian - I had the Risotto with Italian Sausage and it was fabulous.  Servings were very generous along with friendly service. Unfortunately did not get to meet Maria but did see her working in the back. My new favourite Italian!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScjl6QVVREAE,"Good spot for a big group Waiters were really friendly Beef ravioli was delicious, would recommend The tiramisu was very strong! Still tasty Overall great experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdDYtaGFREAE,Authentic and quaint
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNTVTeFVREAE,"maria, i just ate a meal at mariasssss."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMU56alFBEAE,"Great family run restaurant,  classic Italian fare"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUthRk1nEAE,"On a night where my partner was out of town I took myself out to dinner to Maria‚Äôs Trattoria. It was special! Warm & lovely staff with smiles on their faces, vintage decor that makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a corner restaurant in a small Italian town, and even friendly fellow diners who I chatted with while I ate my meal.  As other reviews have said, get the smaller portion size! I got small and had enough leftovers for lunch the next day!  I‚Äôll be back for sure, loved it :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOTc2OVJnEAE,Amazing authentic Italian food. Highly recommend it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLVlITTRnRRAB,"Very generous and very good food !! And very friendly people, one lady in particular is so warm and nice, felt like home, I loved it !! Grazie mille"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMTVxMGpnRRAB,Great food and service. Huge serves. Simple but great food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3JpWlBBEAE,"I can't believe I haven't been here in all the years it's been open. Excellent service, authentic food, and a room with such great energy - just what a real Italian trattoria should be like. I will definitely be back and recommending to others... gracie mille"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXZpa3VBRRAB,Love the pasta...keep up the great food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbDZfUDZBRRAB,Amazing place to have an excellent Italian experience. 1000% recommend it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb3FXQVV3EAE,The best place for pasta in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbFpDWm5RRRAB,A truly awesome restaurant. Pasta was divine and the staff were gracious and welcoming. Yummy desserts as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd0lyVVV3EAE,The best home made Italian food in Melbourne by far
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkotLUV3EAE,Without equal.  It's not the cheapest coffee in Melbourne but you will not find a better one.  And the owner's knowledge of coffee preparation - from cultivation to cup - is astonishingly vast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkk2YzZ3RRAB,"Lovely service, a great cafe."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0l2cVdnEAE,Great coffee both filter and white! Great services! Friendly staffs.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b09EeUFREAE,Great find nearby several other great cafes! Enjoyed my batch brew and friendly staff! Recommended to me by Ming from Ona Coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWQ3ZjZ3RRAB,Absolutely amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzk3U3J3RRAB,"a true hidden gem for coffee lover! if you love pour over, brewed coffee, this is the place for you. they also have light snacks, sandwiches if you want something light. Great atmosphere as well, perfect for a friend catch up or a weekend treat ü´∂üèª"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGJudldnEAE,Probably Melbourne's best coffee experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd0xYTXBnRRAB,Hands down one of the best coffees in Melbourne. They have a variety of filter coffee to choose from and the staff actually took the time to explain and recommend me which one I might like.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNXBDZmp3RRAB,"For the first time I saw that almost everyone in the coffee shop had varietal coffee on the tables It was amazing The assortment is varied, inside is stylish. There is a landing on the street Great coffee shop"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXRXQmVREAE,"Stumbled upon this hidden gem and was gobsmacked by how amazing their coffee was! Also to top it off, the customer service was an 11/10! It was just the perfect experience. Highly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNExMZjVRRRAB,"They do serve pretty specialty coffee. However, the coffee taste isn‚Äôt worth the extra cost. Just a small cup of coffee for 8 $. In my opinion, it is too expensive and on top of that, they will charge you an extra 10% or even 20% at the weekends. I won't recommend it for coffee as a choice of the top 3."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMy11WkJnEAE,"Melbourne‚Äôs hidden gem. Friendly customer service. Great products. Very clean. You‚Äôre getting more for what you paid for. Omakase version of coffee service. Unique vibes than your regular vibes you get at other cafes.  Overall, this cafe is on a league of its own."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejk3aTVnRRAB,They do serve specialty coffee with great service n ambiance; but the coffee taste isn‚Äôt worth the hype & extra cost
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodTZLZlZ3EAE,"A really cool and unique experience. Really enjoyed the vibes of this place. Despite not being a coffee drinker myself I really enjoyed the visit. Both the drink and the gluten free cake I had were delicious. They are really knowledgeable about coffee and not at all pretentious about it, they're more than happy to answer any questions. My partner and friend loved their coffee."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodW8yRmxnRRAB,"For some reason, it can only be taken out, and the flavor is fully explained when it is delivered. When you come to Australia, it is necessary to drink good coffee and understand the difference between Batch Brew and Pour Over. My friend recommends Anaerobic"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ05ibURnEAE,Good experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbXNLRnhRRRAB,"Life is friendly, it is wide, it is delicious. I'm sorry The best cafe in Melbourne"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdW9ieFJBEAE,"Wow, we ‚ù§Ô∏è this place - the decor, food and of course the coffee - 2nd to none! Do try the Christmas cherry & cranberry pie if they have it - best pie we have EVER had!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNzVlWVVnEAE,One of the best speciality coffee in Melbourne. Nice staff who are very friendly and helpful in choosing your coffee. I loved it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNTlhbGRBEAE,"There are many new cafes opening in Melbourne. I like coffee with new interior and unique menu, but I love path that are faithful to the basics. Honest coffee, comfortable space and amazing oat ice latte. Also have friendly staff. everything is perfectüòå‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd192M1BREAE,"A pour over specialty coffee place that has a great, clean, and relaxed vibe. While some may consider the pricing to be a bit steep, I personally think that their pour over coffee is still worth trying. Staff are highly approachable, friendly and knowledgeable about their products which is a bonus. I had a glass of Jardines Del Eden with ice which I highly recommend, it almost had a taste of fruity wine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNTdmOUNnEAE,Great selections of single origin beans and minimalist atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMmRhWTZRRRAB,Beautiful coffee! Thank you.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OExMdy1BRRAB,Just loved the authentic dumplings üòã
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSam9lTFBREAE,Best place to try nepali cuisine . The place to be never missed in if you are in Melbourne ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanRYSm53RRAB,Oh my god what a fooddd. Authentic nepalese. Thank you for the beautiful food and drinks you guys are kings..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanRYZU5BEAE,Had jug of beer and badel ko choila very tasty and ethical taste ..... mostly recommended for my Nepalese brother and sister
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDlULTNBRRAB,"The waitress was warm and welcoming, and provided excellent service.  The whole time we were eating though, I felt like we were at Defqon festival. The music was extremely loud and overwhelming. The band was great, but a few decibals lower would have been perfect.  The chatpate, Momos and lassi were the saviours of the night, full of flavour and delicious.  However, the dhido, thali set and chicken curry were below par and underwhelming. Unfortunately we were unable to taste the authentic Nepalese flavour.  Dhanyawad üôè"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDZ5WHl3RRAB,"Not good customer service, too much waiting then they said and serve cold food after long waiting. Won't recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDdUMUFnEAE,"The momos, mango lassi and chatpate were the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately the thali set, Gulab Jamun and dhido set were below average and chicken curry was inedible as it was overpowered with salt and cumin. Live music was nice but very loud making it hard to hear across the table and we had  difficulty conversing with our friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGNqRmhBRRAB,Best in Melbourne brother!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWNHWV9BRRAB,We booked the venue for our wedding for 40ppl Nepali Food was so amazing and good to price And staff were so friendly and well organised ü•∞ü•∞

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdXZHSFR3EAE,Best Nepalese restaurant in melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdGUtV1J3EAE,Best and authentic jhol momo (soup dunplings) in Melbourne. Really good hospitality and warm vibes. Alcohol was cheap as well compared to other places.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb0lhSklREAE,"Large and filling banquet, beautiful food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScC15WjV3RRAB,worst service ever! Don‚Äôt get chips there‚Äôs no bother there cold!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa3FTNHlRRRAB,pretty good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbl9Ma0ZBEAE,"Paying in cash gets you a 5% Discount. For a $39 per person buffet, its a good price point with quality meats. However I wouldn't recommend ordering the steaks as they are difficult to cook well. The side dishes were alright, maybe a bit tasteless and not a large selection of korean side dishes. Otherwise for this cheap of a price for a buffet, its rather good quality."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ3ZmRnJBRRAB,"Service was great! Meat quality was below average for the beef, however the fresh pork belly was quite good alongside the marinated meats."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbExTbjJ3RRAB,lampblack too heavy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTc2SlJBEAE,Went home fat
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGVtVThRRRAB,"The menu says fresh meat tho when served they are frozen. The pork belly on the pic you can see frost. Taste okay, pricy if you go on weekends, and the 8pm session practically (kitchen close) finishes at 9:30 even the booking is till 10. Stuff are nice and corn cheese tastes good, tastes like yogurt corn cheese.  Also personally I don‚Äôt think anything on the menu is wagyu but maybe it‚Äôs old frozen wagyu so tastes different lol"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc01LbllnEAE,"I'm a korean bbq fan, and we love quality, unfortunately this particular restaurant was, just not up to the standard we expected.  Very run down, and very average in deco, run down and not welcoming at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNkkzZkpnEAE,Amazing portions and taste. Incredible service very accommodating even gor our vegan friend. Highly recommended AAA+++
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNlBXd01nEAE,The service here was phenomenal they served us more food than we could even handle. Iris served our table and she was an absolute legend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcWZ6ajJnRRAB,Staff need to explain what to do. Learn some English would help
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaXFUY2FBEAE,"Average to below average food, and was heavily overcharged for leftover bones and fat. Try BBQ King instead. Amazing place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCc05lWGFBEAE,"Great service Good selection of meats, veggies, and sides $40 all you can eat. No complaints! üòâ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDVuNVlBEAE,"Cheaper to dine in during weekdays and slughtly more expensive if on weekends. There is plenty of free parking on the side streets after 6.30 given that it is nesr Vic Market. Ehen you get seated they bring out some starters and side dishes such as tokbokki, fried chicken, kimchi jiggae, and vegetables while your meat is being prepared. They serve pork, beef, shrimp and chicken, all of which are unlimited refills. Their marinated meats and corn cheese are a must. Great value for food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMUxMNnBRRRAB,"Staff were friendly but that‚Äôs about it. Quality of the meats were not good, they were very bland and tough to chew. Staff had to change our hot plate 3 times due to meat continuously becoming stuck on the plate and burning. Table became too crowded with items that were randomly placed at our table that we did not order. Felt really ill when I came home. There are definitely better Korean BBQs around."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtamE3SzhnRRAB,"Recently stumbled across this place while looking for a korean bbq restaurant for my friend's birthday. It has a selection of meat (beef, pork, chicken and prawn), as well as side dishes (fried chicken, tteokbokki, corn cheese, salad, kimchi soup etc).  Food was good and worth it for the ayce price ($39.90 from mon to thurs or $42.50 from fri to sun for a limit of 2 hours). We had a good cooking + socialising experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMnNlNi1BRRAB,Delicious but wsot staff not very attentive
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcXJIVnhRRRAB,I have tried many bbq in Melbourne but this ones not bad for the price . Service was a bit slow but their marinated meats were tasty enough to leave the service aside . It's a busy place so recommend making a prior booking
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteXN5bVFREAE,This is our go-to Korean BBQ place! Staff is lovely and the food is always fresh! Great variety as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleGJ5QWhnRRAB,Pretty good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMXJtWGlBRRAB,Unique experience and accomodating for a large function. Food was great!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaU9qMkpnEAE,"Great experience and outstanding service by the staff would recommend. Lost a star due to meat selection BUT, the available meat was exceptional! Yum yum yum"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbG9pajVRRRAB,Great for students on a budget as it‚Äôs cheap that‚Äôs why I gave it the extra star. However the gas keeps going out on our bbq. The quality of the meat was low and the salad was not fresh and taste weird.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXFMUUx3EAE,"Food quality, service and decor is average. All you can eat 2hr session.  Could be better, needs improvements in the  side dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkpuWmNREAE,Great food and drink choices made for a very enjoyable experience. Can't wait to go back soon.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNExuT21nRRAB,Pound for pound the best pub in Melbourne. Fresh food made from scratch. Friendly staff and a wonderful ambience. Ideal for a sit down meal or a stop by relaxing drink.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTczZk9REAE,Went for Dinner with a group of 6.  The meals were all good.  I personally had the steak (cooked to the chefs recommendation) and it was spot on!  Staff were attentive and helpful. Great old pub with a lovely menu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnZla3dRRRAB,Great food at a reasonable price. Friendly staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLThTR3hnRRAB,"Great food, wine and staff!! Highly recommended this pub to all. Chef made up his own menu for us and the seafood was to die for! Loved everything about this pub, but the best part was the staff!!!! Well done to all and will definitely be back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMU43X1ZnEAE,"A beautiful place for evening drinks with snacks or a sit down meal. A huge wine list and any drink you like, they probably have it! Really friendly staff and a well designed dog friendly beer garden! üê∂ ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobzd6QnhRRRAB,Really delicious food. Also great atmosphere for casual drinks and lovely cosy outdoor area. We took our kids there and the kitchen were very happy to adjust things for picky eaters. I also have gluten issues and did not have any reactions to their gluten free items.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM2FUZWh3RRAB,"Pub environment with restaurant level food, wich might not be what everyone wants when walking into a pub. The food was good but expensive, so go for a special meal rather than just for food. Friendly staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXYzZTlnRRAB,"Beautiful food, great wine and amazing service. It was a great venue for my birthday with my mum, siblings, grandma and cousins."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcmRqaTBnRRAB,We had a fabulous night at Bobbie Peels. The staff are incredible‚Ä¶very welcoming &  friendly from the minute we arrived. Adam the chef even came to our table to chat with us about one of our guest‚Äôs food intolerances. He couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating & adapted our choices to suit. What a great guy he is! The food was absolutely delicious! I can‚Äôt fault this place at all & will definitely recommend to others & return to try everything else on the menu!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeGJXMmp3RRAB,"Just had dinner with a couple of friends and we were all blown away by the service . Adam the chef came out, introduced himself and offered to adapt anything on the menu to my dietary needs after hearing I was a bit limited at the moment. Wow! That‚Äôs never happened . What a delight he is and so are the rest of the team there. Friendly, down to earth and nothings a bother to them. Food was gorgeous. Already can‚Äôt wait to return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNmU3WlBnEAE,It is good for a beer
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNXBUVHhBRRAB,"An absolute beauty! Ordered a couple of small plates to share (calamari, prawn dish + a lamb dish) and *had* to go back for more! By that I mean the food was so perfectly cooked and delicious we needed more of it. Ordered the pappardelle and the ribbons of pasta were silky smooth, very moreish!  We will be returning!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOHJpRjZnRRAB,Stopped in here for a Friday work lunch and was super excited by the new menu. Excellent wine selection by the glass and very tasty food. Friendly service. Will be back for sure
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCakxUUmpRRRAB,Great food and really friendly service. Loved it and can't wait to go back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaUotdUpnEAE,"We were expecting pub grub. What we got was amazing. Stunning local mussels and home made bread, barramundi with celeriac and gorgeous rosemary potatoes matched by a stunning wine list. God if we were locals we would be here once a week. Forgot to mention the fabulous down to earth service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdWRtMEZREAE,Christmas function lunch photos as shown
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcXJQTW5nRRAB,"Upon entering Bobbie Peels, the first thing that struck me was the atmosphere. The venue is dark and moody, with great lighting that sets the perfect tone for a night out. The design of the bar is spot on, with a cozy and inviting vibe that immediately draws you in.  As for the food, I had the carbonara and it was pretty good. The menu is extensive and there's something for everyone. My friends also enjoyed their meals, and we all left satisfied.  One highlight of the night was the Victorian whiskey that I was recommended. It was peaty and complex, with a depth of flavor that really impressed me. I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you're a fan of whiskey.  All in all, Bobbie Peels is a great spot for a night out. The food is good, the drinks are even better, and the atmosphere is spot on. If you're in the mood for a cozy and laid-back evening, this is the place to be."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNk11UXpnRRAB,Awesome place thanks for the tour Susie
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMi03YUxnEAE,"Yummy food! There is a selection of pasta, meat and seafood. My kids loved the chips. I enjoyed the variety of beers on tap. We will be back Monday so I'll add pics then."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtamN2dG9nRRAB,"Great selection of drinks, excited to try the food next time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdWZyUHVRRRAB,great tunes. stumbled across this while walking. the staff were friendly and happy to give us a sample of the craft beer . before we decided . oh the food!! the fresh made pasta was fantastic. what a great choice of hangout for two hours ..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbXBIRUR3EAE,Don't make a reservation there. We have got ours approved. Show up there and they were closing and never called us.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE15VFVREAE,"Great place to taste authentic north-Indian flavors. They have a wide variety of veg and non-veg Indian curries to choose from. Their Kadhai paneer/palak paneer or the daal are must-try items if you're looking for veg options. For the meat items, butter chicken and lamb rogan josh are just yum!  But if you want to score a bang for the buck, I'd recommend the veg/meat-lovers thali, which will be served with three different curries with rice and a butter naan.  Owners are very friendly and welcoming.  Additionally, all the meat dishes are halal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mk5XSXJRRRAB,I am visiting this restaurant from a month and I must say their food is delicious üòã
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDkyaEVBEAE,"Honest, delicious Indian food that fills the tummy and heart. Butter chicken and chicken vindaloo is exceptional because they precook the chicken in the tandoor grill, giving it extra flavour. Food is fresh and the spices made me feel healthy eating it. They started using a touch screen device to order food but it was confusing to use. Thankfully there's an option to speak to the staff who takes the orders and answers our questions. For a small place like this, the device really isn't necessary in my humble opinion, as the friendly service complements the food well and brings people back.  Ordered the thali meals with a selection of curries(I wish they'd list which curries are available to choose from, and if I want the more expensive options then just say +$2 or whatever as an add on). The mango lassi is thick and yoghurty, delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbS1yd3R3RRAB,"Classic Curry Indian Restaurant is a great place to enjoy delicious and authentic Indian food. The butter chicken, thali and naan are amazing. The service and atmosphere are excellent. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTZxMkdREAE,"Classic Curry is a gem of a restaurant that offers authentic and delicious Indian cuisine. The service is friendly and prompt, and the prices are reasonable. The restaurant is clean and cozy, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. I highly recommend this restraunt for anyone who loves Indian food or wants to try something new."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNU51Nzd3RRAB,Tasty food. Friendly service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ19mcG1nRRAB,"Very delicious indian food, definitely recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2FhU2p3RRAB,Nice place to dine in for Indian Cuisine. The naans are very tasty and other dishes too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ1ptVGNnEAE,"I am giving 5 stars review just because the boss asked me to (joking). The butter chicken is nice, good choice for late night food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ1lyTmlBRRAB,"Food quality is good. Service is exceptional.  I informed it‚Äôs my first time in the restaurant and asked the staff to recommend me something as I couldn‚Äôt decide between the thali and Briyani. Recommended to try the Thali. She surprised me by giving a sample portion of lamb briyani to try. The staff also obliged me with Masala tea, which was not in the menu and a smaller portion of samosa, since I‚Äôm the only person eating. Note: I forgot to ask the name of the lady that served me‚Ä¶  All in all, great service and food portions are just nice‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3VDSnBnRRAB,"they make the Samosas fresh and you can really tell, it was bloody delicious. I eat a lot of Indian food too and this Samosa was up there. really nice authentic family run business, when I'm in the area again I'll definitely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXZmeDJBRRAB,Yummy food n great hospitality Must try restaurant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHRiWGtnRRAB,Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant in Melbourne. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. The food is absolutely amazing & everything we tasted melted in other mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had while in Melbourne. Highly recommend..!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnZqLUh3EAE,Fast delivery.  Delicious food. Friendly customer service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnJqUFNnEAE,Fast and friendly

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3Y2OGVnEAE,"Amazing food, we had Rogan Josh, butter chicken. Might have missed out something but taste was so authentic and mouthwatering. Highly recommended this place for food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ28tbzBnRRAB,The best Indian food in Melbourne City !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUttYlV3EAE,Everything is perfect üëç top class service we are very happy üòéüòé5 starrrrr ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUpieWlBRRAB,"A very dirty customer service. He served our food with dirty hands, dirty boot, dirty jeans, and very dirty apron. Think twice before eating here. I had to draw his attention to his dirty appearance. He had to apologise.  I thought it was very disrespectful to customers, to serve people in such dirty way. Taking customers for granted!!. I have never seen such behaviour /attitude in all my eating out in Melbourne. If there is one, i will give the restaurant a negative star ranking. Not up to 1 star.  The authority need to check/investigate the food handling practices of this restaurant behind the scene to ensure they are in accordance with Food hygiene practices under the law. I am not convinced! please watch out before eating here. terrible!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEpEV0xnEAE,"Good food, clean environment"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUtiRmhnRRAB,"Popped in for KBBQ - the food was tasty, the beer was cold, but had noisy kids in the restaurant.  If it wasn‚Äôt for the family sitting next to us, in a 25% full restaurant this place would‚Äôve been five stars. The food was delicious come out we got a mix of beef and pork set. There‚Äôs a lot of competition for Korean barbecue in the area and this place is probably as good as any other.  I have Kloud beer, which isn‚Äôt available in most Korean barbecue restaurants so that was a plus. I just would‚Äôve hoped that the staff or the parents would‚Äôve asked the kids to be a little quieter.  Probably a good place to go. If you‚Äôve got a family, maybe not the singles ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUxhbTlnRRAB,"Amazing! I personally love the presence of R....d and Lizzy. They make the place vibrant and joyful. Ask for them, and you will always get the best food!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUthUWxnRRAB,"All foods really fresh and delicious, staffs are really friendly and kindness, highly recommend!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDduNFVBEAE,"What a fantastic little Korean BBQ restaurant. We had so much amazing food with such high quality meats on offer and delicious accompaniments we left very satisfied. It was out of our way but a friend has really wanted to try it after living nearby, really glad they did."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1ktQ2t3RRAB,Staff were very friendly. Meat was fresh and portioned correctly
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2ZlbENBEAE,"Awesome staff, very friendly helpful and fun, and great food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHRHU2F3EAE,BBQ Brothers 10 is easily one of my top favourite k-bbq places. They have the kindest and most accommodating staff! Food quality is spot on and pretty affordable including the drinks. Been here twice now and the quality remains the same. Will definitely be back!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHB6THpBRRAB,Closes its doors for customers at 130pm; closing hours listed as 230pm.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd09XQ3BBRRAB,"A perfect meal for any occasion!  What particularly stood out here was the impeccable service. From the moment we walked in we were greeted to a vibrant, aesthetically pleasing atmosphere by friendly staff, then seated and given great insights to the menu.  We ordered the younger brother ($74). The meat was absolutely delicious, incredibly tender and each bite just melted in your mouth. The vast array of complimentary dishes ensured that we were exposed to as much of what the restaurant had to offer - not just mouth watering food but a complex culture as well! Throughout the dining experience staff were once again friendly, attentive and proactive - we didn't have to budge yet the meat turned out perfectly juicy and tender.  The condiments made by the restaurant were a cherry on top to the already delicious food, elevating the flavour greatly. There were options suited for all taste buds with sweet and spicy sauces.  Drinks were beautifully crafted and presented, creating a magical dining experience.  Highest compliments to all the staff for the work you do, and to the BBQ Brothers who have truly accomplished something amazing!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0pLUmdRRRAB,"Great food and service. But the air ventilation system are poor. After we finished dinner, our clothes and hair smell badly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd01LQTRBRRAB,"Undoubtedly one of the best Korean bbq experiences I‚Äôve ever had. The servers, chefs and workers there were so kind hearted, caring and were the ones who made the experience a complete dream! The food was absolutely delicious, so authentic, the quality was outstanding and incredibly filling - hats off to the chefs there and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more food enriching experience! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great food night out - this place is the one!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMi1EYVNnEAE,"Meat could have been cooked a bit more so the fat renders. Nothing good about eating medium rare with chewy fatty bits.  Disappointed with the gas stove. Was expecting charcoal, would have gone elsewhere if had known this prior.  No sesame oil or even salt. No soybean paste or red pepper paste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGZIc1ZREAE,"I'd give service more than 5*, if only I could! Excellent service mind staff, very accommodating. Food was delicious! Would go back again for sure"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWR1aXp3RRAB,We had Korean BBQ for two. The food was average. Service was good.  Would I go again? - No.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWZxQnRBRRAB,Delicious Korean BBQ. Clean and good atmosphere. Nice staff. I used an online booking service to book which was useful. I had a good time with my friends. Thank you.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXY2UC13RRAB,"It‚Äôs amazing food and the staff are friendly and nice üëç the galbi with bone was good. I love that the staff grill meat and explains the food, I literally need to just eat ü§£"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbElEdVJBEAE,"Came with a party of 16, was fantastic. Great food, amazing experience. 10/10"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaE9DWjJ3RRAB,"Very tasty Korean BBQ restaurant. In addition to the Wagy≈´ meat, there were many side dishes. The shrimp dumplings as a starter are also recommended. The friendly service is also happy to cook for you and cut the meat into smaller, juicy pieces. In terms of price, it's a little cheaper than a European steakhouse, but in my opinion it's much better üòã"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbUtTRjlRRRAB,"Some of the best customer service, and the food was A++. I would happily recommend anyone and everyone to bbq Bros,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodC1PeGNREAE,"What an amazing night! Visited for the first time with my wife and tried their new recommended wagyu meat Premium Short Rib Steak and Marinated pork Galbi.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazYyNHNnRRAB,"Delicious Vietnamese food, right taste, reasonable price, enthusiastic service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHNYYVNREAE,"banh mi is just about alright, not special though. many better places around and i only go there because it's the only place close to me. i do like the bread they use. they don't give anywhere near enough meat, barely any at all especially if pork belly, and no flavour much of pate. grilled pork or chicken is better choice. service isn't as good as other places. ice coffee is way too small and mediocre. pho isn't amazing. dim sims somehow manage to be entirely frozen solid after waiting to the point of eating a meal through, happened on numerous occasions to a friend who eats there often. not awful, not great"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNlAtNHN3RRAB,Excellent bahn mi! Will be coming back to try other items on the menu.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlLUxuQ3NnRRAB,Great friendly service and incredible banh mi. Highly recommend the tofu banh mi.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldGVUUld3EAE,Best Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef & Pork Noodle soup)! Really delicious and generous serving and not too spicy (you can add more chilies). They also do a great Special Beef Pho and have great combo deals with Banh mi for lunch. Highly recommend!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMGRyY0JnEAE,Fresh and tasty Vietnamese food. The banh mi bread was absolutely delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMU0yZGlnRRAB,"Great lunch spot. Incredible Banh mi, treat yourself to a good time"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aU9tOGtBRRAB,DECENT RANGE OF PHO NOODLES AND ROLLS I Wrap is on Elizabeth St and is a good option for a quick meal. Pho tastes authentic and the banh mi is tasty  :) there is a single step up into the cafe but otherwise people with mobility issues should be fine. Outdoor tables.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzRqR3J3RRAB,I had the crispy pork Bahn Mi and beef pho soup. One of the best lunch‚Äôs I‚Äôd ever had
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d2FldzF3RRAB,"There are so many Vietnamese bakeries in North Melbourne but this one is worth the visit.  The place has a great range of Vietnamese food but I generally stop by for a pork roll. The tiger bread is tasty and the chili packs a punch, delicious!!!  I enjoy sitting outside in the sun and enjoying my roll watching the world go by, worth a visit!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OE8tRnFBRRAB,Food is good. It would be better if the surface of table and floor can be cleaner. The floor is too slippery‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPam9DMXp3RRAB,"Lovely little place with wonderful staff. The noodle soup was excellent, the dim sims average. Appropriately priced, this place is must visit for Vietnamese cuisine lovers! They sell out b√°nh m√¨ very quickly though üòÖ ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd19hZGl3RRAB,"The food is no longer good for the increased price, increased so many times in 2 months. Pho Victoria is better"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM096Umt3RRAB,"Just had crispy pork banh mi and it was terrible.Burnt bread,barely 2-3pcs of pork and taste horrible...ate here couple of times before and was alright but this time it's worst and they charge $9.50 for this.Terrible"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNG83TE9nEAE,"The staff were so friendly, and the food was prepared quickly. They have a few combo deals which I found to have great value.  Great tasting pho and Banh Mi"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbFpQMk5nEAE,"The grilled chicken pho tasted strong and rich, the ice coffee tasted strong and rich too, highly recommended!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeV9lRDJRRRAB,"Unique take on nothern chinese bbq. Meats were tasty and marinated well. The sauce and spices went very well with the meat. We ordered the premium set (includes 4 types of meat, lettuce and soup), rice and ox tongue. What I particularly liked about this restaurant is that the ventilation was really good, we didn't come out smelling like cooked meat!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzRlSU5BEAE,The waitress was a little inexperienced or too shy but the food was good. Took my 2 Aussie friend to show them some different cultural food and they loved it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3REbEhREAE,I love the food and atmosphere! The service was amazing üëçüèª
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXY3akNBEAE,"Not so great, one portion of side dishes for two. The service was bad, need to ask for every single thing. We ordered a beer and water, only we got served the beer and keep waiting for the water. The restaurant was not busy at all, just a few tables that were already served."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dTRLcnlRRRAB,"have to give review to get discount, food was ok but not great there are better korean bbq around"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaktQVWlnRRAB,"Honestly. Charcoal Grill >>>>> super yummm! ü§§üî• Perfect for ‚Äòem family dinners.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmNmVDN3RRAB,"Why have I not tried KBBQ sooner? If you haven‚Äôt, I highly suggest you do and start off at @dancingflamemelbourne to kick off your KBBQ experience. @dancingflamemelbourne offers Chinese & Korean fusion cuisine which is Influenced by the restaurants of Northeast/Manchuria China and Korea.  What we ate:  ü•© Diced Mayura Wagyu M8 ü•© Seasoned Angus beef brisket ü•ì Pork Belly üåΩ Cheese & Corn üçú Cold Noodle w/Pork üçó Sweet & Spicy Chicken ü•ó North-Eastern Style Sweet & Spicy Salad üçö Steamed Rice  Our review:  Can‚Äôt beat melt-in-the-mouth, tender M8 Mayura Wagyu, but the Seasoned Angus Beef Brisket combined with the Korean style sauces, spices and fluffy steamed rice was also a highlight.  A Hibachi style grill made the experience so much more exciting and finishing the cooking of the meat infused a beautiful charcoal flavour.  The North-Eastern Style Sweet & Spicy Salad & the Cold Noodle w/Pork was a lovely refreshing addition to the meal, with the North Eastern salad being top tier. I did however find that the Corn Cheese would be best served on a grilled plate as being cooked on top of the grill didn‚Äôt give that satisfying melty bubbly cheese top. I also would have preferred the Pork Belly diced. The Sweet & Spicy Chicken was really tasty and moreish.  If you‚Äôre looking for a more interactive & intriguing dining experience, then I highly recommend checking out @dancingflamemelbourne  Thank you @dancingflamemelbourne for having us. üíì"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXBYTExnEAE,"I recently visited this restaurant and unfortunately had a very disappointing experience. Firstly, the quality of the meat was not up to standard as it was not fresh and seemed to be frozen. The meat also had a sour taste which made it difficult to enjoy.  In addition, the sauces provided were overly salty and did not enhance the flavor of the dishes. The service was also very slow, and it took a long time for our food to arrive.  The corn cheese was a major letdown as the cheese did not even melt properly and the overall quality was very poor. The taste was average and the cheese was hard to chew.  The stone pot rice had an excess amount of water and the egg was overcooked, which made it less appetizing. Overall, the experience was very disappointing, and I would not recommend this restaurant to others."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3VMRWhnRRAB,Korean Chinese charcoal BBQ place just stone throw north of Queen Vic Market. They have options of wagyu platters and Korean-inspired dishes such as seafood and kimchi soup. Good exhaust hood system too so we didn‚Äôt find ourselves and our clothes in smoky perfume. Kind staff.  Check out our reel on Instagram @melbournefoodtravel
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX0lqcC1RRRAB,It is excellent and delicious food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOEtiQkZnEAE,"I‚Äôve always  enjoyed AYCE BBQ. My partner and I have always eaten AYCE as we eat SO much. However you can definitely tell the quality difference.  What we ordered:  ‚≠êÔ∏è SUPER SET: Wagyu & beef plate, seafood plate, veggies, kimchi, corn cheese, lettuce and beef ‚≠êÔ∏è Pork belly ‚≠êÔ∏è Mixed veggies (zucchini, pineapple & Cabbage)  The seafood set comes with calamari, scallops, prawns & mussels. The wagyu and beef plate comes with Premium Mayura Wagyu (M8) + Hot & Spicy Diced Mayura Wagyu (M8) + Seasoned Angus Beef Brisket + Oyster Blade.  The wagyu is bloody amazing üëå it just melts in your mouth and taste so tender. The marinade is also delicious and sweet and the salt provided pairs so well with it. I cannot fault the feed just absolutely amazing.  The scallops were also the highlight. They took a while to cook evenly but other than that these were my favourites."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc09td1pREAE,we had a really lovely meal here having the best of both worlds - chinese & korean food üòç We recommend the wagyu beef plate. The calamari fried rice was also really flavorful ‚Ä¶

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeHVDd25BRRAB,Professional service and delicious food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHItUm5nRRAB,"Saw somebody unconscious from being intoxicated. The staff was laughing and talking about them in the back. No body helped her except for her friends. Only until one of them shouted for napkins and stuff, they then decide to help a bit.  Absolutely shocking how they treat their customers when it's their responsibility to help them. I hope the the staff learn really quick that without her friends being there, knowing first aid and actually helping her, she could have suffocated."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dko3cllnEAE,Boat noodle portion size is big. Taste is okay.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d083Y053EAE,Yummy food for a good price ü§§
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z0lHc0x3EAE,"The store itself is nice, and the staff were very pleasant. However, the food is extremely average, esp for the price tag it comes with. The fried rice was too sweet and texture was very wet (as you can see from the image). Tried the boat noodles, and though it wasn‚Äôt bad‚Ä¶ it was definitely not good. A very flat and linear flavour. Just to reiterate, I would consider this to be expensive for the quality of food. If it fetches a high price, I‚Äôd expect higher standards. However the staff were friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSal9yUVlnEAE,Food was excellent. We just came back from 2 months in Thailand so my expectations were high. We had a range of dishes and all were good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXBMa053EAE,"Been here twice, decent Thai Resto in Carlton. Great value with weekday lunchtime deal. Recommend their boat noodle"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzc2S3lnRRAB,Amazing Thai food in Carlton very close (2 min walk) to the city. Huge portion sidings and the girl serving me was so kind. I really appreciated the delicious and warm Beef Massaman on a cold Melbourne day. Thank you.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ1lDYkVREAE,"We tried the Osha curry fried rice (it's average), papaya salad (nice but a little too sweet), and Sukho Thai noodle soup (we tried medium spicy, quite nice)  Serving size was good and service was ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3JxWXdBRRAB,Thai Fish Cake - 3/5 BBQ Lemongrass Pork - 5/5

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoazhmLXR3RRAB,Foods so very good I went there every week it make me happy when I ate food and staffs service very good like I eat food in my home.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNnJqWmJ3EAE,"Amazing food, very friendly staff and good portion sizes. Ordered the garlic and pepper chicken stir fry with coconut rice. Blown away by the flavours honestly. Highly recommend ü§ù ‚Ä¶"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa1BMSExnEAE,"Omg , the food is so amazing here , didn‚Äôt expect that ! Will come back to explore other menu !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNEtuN0VBEAE,"Friendly service and a nice ambiance, however the chicken could be nicer. Without the dipping sauce, it tasted quite bland.  I like their reusable ordering method, and it‚Äôs convenient to indicate the spiciness level."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzVYWjFBRRAB,"Big portion for the food , it's worthy. Boat noodle and chicken are good , we love them. However , Kauy Jab is too sweet for me. Try to avoid peak hours since foods come out quite slow."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNnRuN0FnEAE,osha thai is the best Thai food in Melbourne for me  !!! I love the new fried chicken menu and $1 fried chicken with authentic Thai sauce ! Already planning to try coconut fried chicken . Tom yum fried chicken was really good .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMFAzcEt3EAE,Portions are big and very authentic Thai food .Really suitable for dinner gathering . They serve wine and beer!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!! And I have to mention their three crispy salad is reallyyyyy good . Full fill my Appetite ! Definitely will come back again !!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbmE2djB3RRAB,"A Thai gem in Carlton! Value for money is amazing and the flavours were phenomenal! For $14, you can get a solid bowl of noodles or a curry with rice. They‚Äôre also not skimpy with portions so you know you‚Äôre getting a bang for your buck.  I adore this place and will be back to explore the whole menu ü§§"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMWVqNEt3EAE,"You will not regret ordering blindly here, because everything on the menu is delicious..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLWE3cTRRRRAB,"Highly recommended, I love boat noodles so much, the milk tea in the store is only 2.5üî™ What kind of bicycle do you want."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDREUFhBEAE,Very authentic Japanese food & awesome location if your a university student whose keen to spend the extra money for good eel & beef.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDdXY21RRRAB,"The food is good, I won't say it is amazing but I love the bento variety. Service was definitely great. I wouldn't mind coming back again but it is a bit expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWJ6MS13RRAB,"Inedible dishes, meat unfit for consumption: it is only the fat and the bones. No possibility of taking a dish without a drink imposed by the establishment in the menu"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWZQRU5BEAE,"Delicious and affordable bento lunch set. The portion is big, you get appetizer, main dish, side dish, and dessert in one set. We ordered the pork katsu, it was moist and perfectly cooked. My son liked his teriyaki salmon set. All the dishes we had were delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWZianFBRRAB,"DOESN‚ÄôT WORTH even half of the price. I don‚Äôt usually write a review, even if the food is not that good. BUT this restaurant definitely DOES NOT worth 4.6stars.  The food was nicely displayed, and it‚Äôs the only good thing about the restaurant.  I ordered beef scotch fillet set, and the beef was no more 2mm thick (basically 1/4 of the very cheap $15 scotch fillet u can find in the market).  The sides was tiny, I would say the cost of all the side dishes is no more than $5. I have to grab a sandwich after fishing the whole set :))  The taste is, well, average.  Let‚Äôs be honest the food doesn‚Äôt worth $38 at all. There‚Äôs so many Japanese meal set places in the city witch offers better food at a more reasonable price. Don‚Äôt waste your money here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanZ2Yjl3RRAB,Great set menu item. Delicious. Went with family.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZpWF9nRRAB,Beyond Amazing Lunch! Super delicious and yummy. Its great for a causal lunch date and I‚Äôd love to come back at night to see what the atmosphere is like. The pork Katsu was so mouthwateringly good and our favorite between the beef scotch fillet and the pork Katsu
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHMtNXZRRRAB,"if you miss japanese home cooked meal, there's a place in Carlton üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEpxRWZnEAE,"Good food, albeit on the slightly more expensive side. The meal can be considered a light Japanese meal that fills one just right.  The atmosphere at lunch is like a cafe. Music can be hit or miss. Had Casiopedia (great Japanese funk band from the 70s) on my first visit. Generic Jrock on my second.  Still worth it for the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2ZqczV3RRAB,Food was very tasty. Great selection and variety of sides with good balance of flavours. Had to take 1 star off as service was lacking. I stood waiting to be seated for over 10 minutes. A number of staff noticed me but ignored me. My understanding was that the hostess was preoccupied but to be treated like I was invisible wasn't pleasant. A simple greeting to acknowledge my presence and to let me know to wait a little would've been enough.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdm9uMGxBRRAB,"Bad service. Went there waited for 20+ minutes and the waitress only just asked us to wait and did not give us an estimated wait time when asked by us. Also, she did not ask us to provide our names for walk in reservation while others who came after us get to be seated before us. She had only ask us for our names for walk-in reservations after we confronted her about the long wait time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXJHeHRnRRAB,"High quality food and service! The meal sets are absolutely delicious and come with a wonderful range of side dishes. A little dessert is also included in the set, which is a nice way to complete the meal. The staff are very kind and friendly too. My friends and I are all very satisfied with our dining experience  :-)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OXB6N0tBEAE,"One of my favourite places for teishoku. The food is delicious and the service is great.  It is always full so you should reserve through their website especially for bigger parties. They have a credit card deposit per person for reservations.  They have a huge variety of sides served with your chosen main and I always look forward to them.  As I have a dietary restriction, they always offer to swap one of the side dishes instead of just excluding it which I greatly appreciate. You have to bring it up when ordering though, just mentioning it in your booking is not enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3RYQmF3EAE,"Remember to book your table because they get soooo busy during lunch time and there can be a very long queue. Food is delicious and I love the variety in the teishokus. The price is higher than average bentos and combo meals, but I'll say it really worth the price. If you're the kind of person who likes having side dishes, soup, fresh seafood and dessert all-in-one go (or if you like fancy plating), you'll fall in love with this place! Just be aware as they are very busy, they could be rushing to collect the dishes when you're almost done, keep an eye on any unfinished food especially the dessert. üòÇüòÇ Will definitely come back for dinner next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ3ZxRGJREAE,"We love pork cutlet and it was thick and juicy. I forget to take a photo of thickness of cutlet, because it was too yummy üòãb. I can‚Äôt control myself üòÖüòÑI hope that they keep the quality of pork cutlet. ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN09mTW53RRAB,"One of the best Japanese restaurants I‚Äôve been to in Melbourne, booking is essential, but worth the wait if you haven‚Äôt booked.  Service is great and options were plentiful too, but we decided on the miso salmon, which was cooked to perfection.  Sides were good too with lots of choice, was very satisfied after finishing the meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamMydURBEAE,"Good variety of sides while you only have to pick your main. Bit pricey considering each side is not too hard to make (wife's words). Easy lunch though, despite not the best value."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGF5RGRnEAE,"One of our favourite places, amazing food and always a different mix so it‚Äôs never boring.  The side dishes are just as great as the main and it always is a perfect balance when put together  The Katsu, Teriyaki salmon and Cauliflower are standouts. If you‚Äôre lucky you might get there on a day they‚Äôre serving milk pudding for dessert!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodXNPY2tRRRAB,restaurant. It is clean
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZOHZUVllBEAE,Had the lunch Teishoku set and really enjoyed it. It was very well thought out and you can tell each item in the set was individually cooked from scratch - no shortcuts! Right down to the wasabi which was freshly grated and not the store bought type. The chef is very passionate about his food and the wait staff were very friendly. Will 100% be back again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocU96OFRREAE,"Not worth the fuss, was okay, expected more after reading reviews but had better tasty Japanese food, value for money, else where."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ektlZXhBRRAB,"I went there to try the Persian food, however when I arrived at the restaurant smelled like burnt oil. I left as it made me feel uncomfortable and unclean."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMGFuSWJBEAE,No wonder it‚Äôs got good rating. Amazing Sabz world !! I chose to have it with tortilla than in a bread. They were kind enough to make the change. Thank you. I‚Äôll come back again and try the hummus with bread and tiramisu. Tastes so good.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was excellent. The meat was cooked to perfection, and the spices were just right, giving the kebab a perfect balance of flavor.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, and I loved the decor. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, making us feel right at home.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy some delicious, authentic kebab in a warm and welcoming environment. I'll definitely be back soon!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMVpieVhnEAE,"One of the best Turkish kebabs in town.

Portion size is perfect and very friendly service. Highly recommended üëå."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2VHdUNBEAE,"I tasted the best taste of Iranian food in Australia in this restaurant, kebabs with fresh and tasty meat at a reasonable price, excellent rice and of course the good manners of the restaurant staff! I suggest you try it."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0lpVmxBRRAB,Outstanding pub. Friendly service. Excellent food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTllVGtRRRAB,"Friendly staff, good food. The pie crust was divine (buttery and flaky) and highly recommend the warm mulled cider (not pictured) that‚Äôs perfect for this weather."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWRmWnRRRRAB,"Awesome pub, in my top 3 anywhere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFlpdkFREAE,Totally surprised that a neighborhood pub would include a sophisticated menu with numerous impressive options.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3IzeDJBRRAB,"Top pub with friendly bar staff, always good to find a place that is open later ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUtDODhRRRAB,"Great sirloin/porterhouse steak! Well maintained, old school, cosy‚Äôish vibe/decorüëåüèº Good service. Pretty much ticks all the boxes. Does the job! üëçüèº"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTZ2Mzh3RRAB,"Ate incredible food in the dining room. Wish I'd taken a pic of the light, lemon-infused ricotta dumplings which were divine! Just one quibble: the boxes piled around the room spoke of a lack of storage space and detracted from the mood. I'll be back, though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzZxVTlBRRAB,"Easter Sunday dinner was disappointing. Blue grenadier fish with the fish & chips main meal was flavourless. Rabbit dish was dry,  and venison pie dish was withdrawn from the menu due to being sold out at only 5.45pm. Service was ok, but wait staff lacked basic knowledge about the menu. On top of all this the expectation of customers to pay 15% more because of the public holiday is a bit rich when the fundamentals are missed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmRlS0NnEAE,Good Vegan options
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGVxQmNBEAE,"I had the venison pie, it was excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHFibDRBRRAB,"Cool historic pub with period interior. Extensive selection of craft beer and drinks. Menu more gastropub with elevated pub staples. We had the beer battered fish and chips; fish was blue grenadier, and it was very good. Staff were friendly and attentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHVqc2h3RRAB,Delicious food Amazing team
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX3JYS3NRRRAB,"Had a good experience at the Lincoln since the first unfortunate one with the management on that Saturday night. I also appreciated the general management getting back to me.  Function food was very subpar. Management was rude, made false accusations and was very arrogant (especially for a very basic  little gentrified pub with a crummy little function room two doors down with no toilets)! The place could be good with better management. Professional management! One expects more from a highly rated hospitality business  in Melbourne where the standard for such venues were very high before the Pandemic and now most of these places are struggling to survive. Bad management makes no sense? Why the rudeness!?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ09EZzd3RRAB,"Yum! You don‚Äôt come across game (in this case rabbit and venison) everyday! And the Lincoln had both deliciously cooked with finesse üòª the atmosphere was buzzing (even on a Tuesday night), drinks flowing and food üëå the best pub/bistrot one could ever hoped for. ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjZEQ2VnEAE,"Solid bar, lovely internal decor, good service. We only had nibbles, they were high quality. Cheese platter felt a little stingy in size but the quality of the cheese made up for it"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOE5ULXF3RRAB,"Absolute garbage lamb isn't goat we know the difference and my order was so incomplete the chicken had no rice accompainment but swimming in oil. I don't like  posting negative reviews but  seriously, maybe it was doordashes fault, straight to the bin  40 dollars wasted"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeE9hczhnRRAB,The best Currie I have ever had in my life. Full stop. These guys make what they have themselves. Beautiful family restaurant. Support them as they are the real deal.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcGVIT3hRRRAB,"Came here tonight. It was fantastic. The food was tasty and delicious. The hostess was welcoming and helpful. Yes it may have been a little slower, but they were making everything fresh and it was worth the short wait. Would definitely recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZX09ER2VnEAE,Staff are nice.  Gluten free food is shit
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBLTRQUjZBRRAB,Very tasty food. Great service and they are serious about gluten free with a gf kitchen. Chicken was on point.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndzd1bC1BRRAB,Never again...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cHBleWh3RRAB,Restaurant was almost empty at 7 on a Friday night. We were told we we ordered that there would be a wait as everything is made fresh. Servings were rather small for the price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURneWZxSG1RRRAB,Absolutely worth the wait.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMEwyd1F3EAE,Over priced and everything tasted the same
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRM3U2NnJBRRAB,"Food was horrible, restaurant was empty and after what we were served it's easy to see why."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBNUt5Sm9BRRAB,"Bit too pricey for students. Taste wise nothing too special, can be termed as ""alright"""
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMS1PYjdBRRAB,The Turkish bread Kebab is the best in the inner city

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmZTY3ZBRRAB,"Very small kebab, like baby size and definitely overpriced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdFk3dUVREAE,All dishes were delicious. Especially the lamb kebab.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWZ1c0ZBEAE,Better than average

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGJYdDV3RRAB,Good HSP but fries could have been crispier and portion larger. Staff was friendly and welcoming :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWVhUVdBEAE,"Tastes not like original, prices high and staff look like bored"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWJDVUx3EAE,"I bought HSP chicken with garlic sauce, sweet chili and barbecue sauce. It was delicious! Recommended"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek0tN1ZnEAE,"I have been to a lot of kebab shops, but none have a tastier chicken kebab than here. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great quality kebab."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCXzhTRzNnRRAB,"My order was ready quickly and meat was well cooked. The quantity was significantly less than I thought it would be for a deluxe meal and the price, but can't fault the quality. A great option for authentic Turkish food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd2F2bHdRRRAB,"very tasty Turkish foods, we love the Deluxe lamb Plater, Gozleme and the Kebab. Located just at the corner of Lygon street. Highly recomend.  The owner and staff are very welcome.  A good food with a decent price"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNHBHX2JnEAE,"Nice premises and good average food. It was pretty late and the person serving looked pretty tired and wasn't really cheerful. I wouldn't say i had a great experience but im going to give this place another shot next time im in town because i have seen it pretty full earlier in the evening. The baklava and other sweets looked pretty inviting. Very clean and cosey decor. I ate takeaway falafels and a kebab. The falafels were deep fried with crispy outside and soft in, quite oily but great flavour. The kebab was on a turkish bread bun but it was more like western bread and a little dry and flakey. Will come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCak9ENVRREAE,We visited from Adelaide. Really friendly staff. Good food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdE5iUXdnRRAB,"Really delicious. The food is really clean, soft and fresh. It's really delicious. I'll go again. It's my current favorite Turkish restaurant."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzcWNYVGNREAE,Fair enough.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMXNuTVBBEAE,Good service but the pasta was by far below average. Wouldn't recommend it. Sauce was bland and no flavor. Added cheese and still didn't help then salt. Ehh.

I was there last night on my own had the spaghetti prawns n salad, owners funny as made me laugh by asking for I.d for a lemon lime bitters (I'm 40) ü§£ I actually thought he was serious lol. Made me laugh so much. Thankyou, I worked a very very hard weekend and I was beyond exausted. Just made my weekend. Think this place might b out new regular spot. üëç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXViNkV3EAE,"Was visiting Melbourne from the country and hadn't been to Lygon st in more than 10 years. This place definitely did not disappoint.  The food was amazing, the service was friendly and a great atmosphere  Will definitely return here for a meal when we visit Melbourne again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzaGRIdTR3RRAB,"Again...this place never ever..lets me down. Its been years now that we visit this place and the taste of their pizzas hasnt changed, same old good pizzas. Their pizzas are so good, you can taste the honesty, freshness, and authenticity. Service is awesome, the chef and the staff are lovely and happy. They even gave us a free chocolate pizza for the kids. Lots of  love and good wishes to them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSakt6T3ZnRRAB,The pizza is simply outstanding. The crust is crispy and fresh with just the right amount of char to give it that perfect smoky flavor. The service is outstanding and the  staff is very friendly..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNkktRV9RRRAB,"Our 2nd visit and we were even more impressed with the quality of the pizzas, pasta and service here than our first visit. Both times we were glad to watch the people queuing at the neighbouring restaurants knowing that we were enjoying a superior dinner and general dining experience. Well priced, excellent menu range, good service times and Carlos had each of our 3 children entertained all night, creating a memorable family experience. We‚Äôll be back again for sure!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSai1hcVJnEAE,Awesome food and great service.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGN5RjhnRRAB,BEST PIZZA IN Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWNEenNnRRAB,"I am thrilled to share with you my extremely positive experience at Mercadante restaurant. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm and friendly smiles by the staff who quickly seated me at a cozy table.  As I perused the menu, I couldn't resist ordering the spaghetti puttanesca, and I was absolutely blown away by how perfectly cooked it was. The sauce had just the right amount of spice and flavor to make each bite an explosion of taste in my mouth.  For dessert, I decided to try the tiramisu, which was absolutely delicious. The layers of creamy mascarpone cheese and perfectly soaked ladyfingers were expertly balanced, making each bite a true delight. And to top it off, the espresso was brewed to perfection, making for a perfect end to the meal.  But what really made my experience at Mercadante stand out was the exceptional service. The waitress was attentive and lovely, always making sure I had everything I needed to fully enjoy my meal.  Overall, I can confidently say that Mercadante is a must-visit restaurant for anyone looking for an exceptional Italian dining experience. The food, service, and atmosphere all exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to go back for another meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNFlEdFFREAE,Food and service absolutely amazing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3YydmxBRRAB,All a bit average!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoemMzanZRRRAB,We visited Mercadante the other night and were blown away by the wide range of pizza and pastas. The smoked salmon pizza was divine and a good size. We loved the carbonara as it was flavourful and not excessively creamy. Perfect spot for a catch up with friends or relaxed date night. Can‚Äôt wait to be back again to try their world famous chocolate pizza!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXVxNS1nRRAB,Loved this restaurant! Garlic bread was perfect side dish and great serving of the mains. Drinks were decorated well and overall loved everything. No issues and the restaurant was vibey with outside area to enjoy your trip:)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDhPeU9BEAE,Most rudest man in shop that I have ever incounted. Maybe he needs a holiday.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamFYQ1hREAE,"I‚Äôm not one to usually leave a review but the man behind the counter (assuming the owner) is extremely rude, dismissive and unprofessional. We ended up walking out without ordering because of his poor attitude. If you do not want to serve certain minority groups then kindly close your doors."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLXV6b0p3EAE,"The owner (i assumed it was the owner) really needs to change his attitude. I felt treated disrespectful from beginning to leaving.  You guys dont really have to read the whole text but for those who are interested ill describe the whole experience:  1. First things first: I came inside with a smile and said hello - i barely got one back, just a grumpy face from owner and his wife I assume.  2. I ordered a chicken kebab and the next customer a lamb kebab. He started cutting the lamb kebab first which is surely ok to me. He took most of them and got it ready for the other guys kebab. Since he hasnt started cutting the chicken kebab yet I asked if I could try a little bit of the lamb kebab to see if I would order a lamb kebab instead (again, he hasnt started working on my food yet so it definitely wasnt too late to ask). He just respomded with a short *no you cant* in a rude tone, not even looking at me.  3. I was slightely surprised and explained him briefly (i usually dont eat lamb, would order a lamb kebab if i like it, i would be happy to pay for the piece i try...). Again he said something like *we dont do that* and really just walked away. I finally ordered a chicken kebab.  4. The kebab itself was very tasty eventhough i had to eat it off the tissue because it fell apart several times and for 18 AUD I was also surprised to get such a small kebab. I didnt complain about the size because I was pretty sure what response I would have been given . Also I was surprized he just added all the vegetables without me asking, so I found myself picking out the onions which is not too bad (and yes i could have said something while he was adding the veggies but i didnt see him doing that since i dont stare at him working for minutes)  5. I was a bit upset but thought maybe its because i asked about a small lamb piece to try, so I pulled myself together, smiled, said thank you and goodbye, Im not even sure if he responded eventhough he clearly heared that while looking at me.  Honestly, this whole experience was questionable. I really dont get why Im the first person mentioning this bad service in the reviews. In case i did upset him with the lamb question im sorry about that but even before I asked about that his hospitality/service was not good. Whatever reasons it were, business owners nowadays need to keep professional. If he does that to other people as well, his business wont survive for long. What a bummer since the (small and expensive) kebab itself is tasty. Because of the good taste i cant give 1 star."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdGJMdndBRRAB,"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. DONT EAT HERE. The owners of this place are VERY selective with who they provide good customer service too. My friends and I went in to eat, we inquired about the menu and were quickly and rudely addressed with ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only lamb and chicken left, what else do you need to think about? What do you want?‚Äù whilst he rushed us. We felt very uncomfortable and confused as too where his aggression toward us was coming from because prior to our interaction, he was serving another customer who he had a completely different attitude towards. He was kind and patient with this customer. We decided to leave and said thanks, whilst walking out, the owner made unnecessary comments towards us suggesting he was happy to see us go, stating ‚Äúyeaaah I thought so‚Äù whilst shaking his head and looking at us up and down. The old owners are extremely rude and unwelcoming. This is the second time this has happened. The lack of customer service alone is enough to make you not eat here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd29iVG93RRAB,Amazing food and service! Quaint venue with beautiful older centry art! Accommodated a larger group on short notice late in the evening and not skipping a beat with hospitality.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzhMSUxREAE,"So disappointed,  they use to be so goooood! Meat was dry, price was quite dear $20 for a small size! man behind the counter was cranky! Last but not least they don't serve chips?! That's kinda odd!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdDhmZVdnEAE,"Used to be better. Meat is certainly less smokey and not as delicious as when I visited a year or so ago. Portions are small. Man who served was cranky and preoccupied, despite the fact we were the only people ordering. He forgot the sauce in the souvlaki. Chips were dry and too salty.  Last but not least, they have rats. Hard no and won't be coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODl5anlnRRAB,Best Souvalaki in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbWRTMVNBEAE,Correct energy and he used his hands on the lemon and I liked it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaktMV1NREAE,They have gotten smaller and more  expensive and some of my meat was dry. The old guy is mean.  They used to be sooo good and loved going there late at night not any more.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeFBxR3BnRRAB,"I was really looking forward to having a kebab after moving out of Melb , we went into lambs placed our order and the place is really run down , far from what I remembered , my lamb kebab was full of fat and grisle I couldn't eat , the pieces were so big and impossible to bite into , it was very unpleasant , my son and wife had chicken kebabs and said they were ok , but for the money I spent it wasnt worth it at all, the toilets out the back were putrid, and after many years eating lambs kebabs unfortunately I don't think we will be back ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDdpWmFBEAE,We have been to so many Greek restaurants and Greek takeaway shops and nothing's comes close to lambs. I know we haven't tried them all but you can't go past lambs on lygon. Yes it's a little outdated and could use a bit of a face lift but the service and food are great . Give it a go. Try the open lamb or chicken souvalaki. I'll definitely be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobV9fcWx3RRAB,"First time here, felt Godfather kinda vibe damn"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGJEWFVREAE,If I ever go back to Melbourne I will definitely stop by this place . The best I ever had in my life
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXMyemlRRRAB,"Been going there when everything else is closed, almost 25 years of patronage and the flavour is original. My son asked for a HSP and was pleased to hear they don't serve such a dish. Defs recommend it. A Melbourne icon in my eyes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ3Y3amZBEAE,Simply the best souvlaki around. Every element is perfect. Succulent meat. Great bread. Fresh tomatoes onion and lettuce. Dill tzatziki. Crispy moist meat. Quarter of a lemon squeezed on every one. Heaven.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX09XYldnEAE,Not a Kebab! It‚Äôs a Souva!!!! Best in town.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURock8zVGdRRRAB,Honestly the best lamb kabab I‚Äôve ever eaten. Fresh. Juicy and really good flavour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoay1qUDVnRRAB,Food was Yummie great atmosphere great prices friendly staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdXJDX0hnEAE,"Sadly, it's slipping away. Less meat in a  $20 gyro, restaurant is deteriorating rapidly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa1lxWjVRRRAB,Excellent costumer service very friendly yummy and healthy food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNnIyaVFnEAE,this place is alway closed when you want it. better off getting a door dash from somewhere else that‚Äôs OPEN üò° ‚Ä¶

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa01UM2pnRRAB,The guy who runs this place is a souvlaki Maestro.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMWRUT2d3RRAB,"great kebabs, was ok with pram outside eating ty"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE1xVS1RRRAB,"Out of $60 ,  the Spring Roll were OK. The Rest was darn ordinary, to say the least."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjdMSlhnEAE,"Ying Thai is honestly a shadow of its former self now. I rarely see it busy anymore, and the service continues to decline. During my recent visit, I had to ask for water, plates, and cutlery a few minutes after our food was served, even though the staff were standing around doing nothing. The prices keep going up, it's now $20 for a pad thai. The food still tastes good at least."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScC1XXzlnRRAB,Delicious taste of the food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnZ1R1R3EAE,"A representative place to eat in Thailand, but no maggo sticky rice, my favorite"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaHJ2cFFnEAE,"The food it's authentic Thai,"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXFxdzZBRRAB,"The food is delicious, but the customer service is not. If you're willing to be treated like nothing but still eat amazing Thai food, this is your place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkoyMWp3RRAB,tasty food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScklPbWl3RRAB,"The food is very average in Thai restaurant, and the man in counter is very rude. Not recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE9MZDBRRRAB,We didn‚Äôt get seated for a long time as the wait person was on the phone and no one else bothered to step in. No apologies or acknowledgement followed and the service continued to be absent. Food was average but our experience was ruined by lack of service. There are PLENTY of good restaurants nearby so I wont return.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2JxZjNnRRAB,"Lovely place! Fry rice and salad is really good, but the beef in Pad Thai is hard to chew."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScllhT25BRRAB,Had the lunch special on a Saturday. Bargain for $15 each and the penang curry was exceptional.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTg3X19RRRAB,"My long-term favourite restaurant for the best Thai food in Melbourne. Service is a bit more haphazard,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTRqdU9nEAE,This was highly regarded according to AGFG but I found it pretty average. The pad Thai desperately need a squeeze of citrus and it was quite spicy which is odd considering it‚Äôs usually on the sweeter side. Entrees were tasty but nothing particularly memorable
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGMzWklnEAE,The food just can eat. the waitress is so rude!! Please find somewhere else.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGZLQlhBEAE,"Very yummy food , good price"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNTl2MF9BRRAB,Nice small restaurant with traditional Vietnamese cuisine. Everything very tasty. The only thing I wish you to have it is a seafood Pho and no bogans
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaWJia0tREAE,The best Pho in town! Absolutely delicious!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbDQtN1dREAE,"Good portion sizes and tasty food. Rice noodles were a bit too thin, thicker noodles would have been better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN2VMcnpRRRAB,I had a pork rice noodle soup and custard apple smoothie. Was so delicious and the service was great!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdnJXdjdnRRAB,Good food and nice staff ‚ô°
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcnNMNFl3EAE,"This restaurant people behaves very rudely with delivery drivers even though they lie about waiting time. Even after waiting for more then 30 mins (first they told 6 mins) , they give negative review on Uber platform. They treat drivers like drivers are not human. Be aware about this poor unprofessional staff who may treat you badly. Don‚Äôt be a victim of anyone‚Äôs negative behaviour especially when you are not in fault."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdHFiSk13EAE,"Delicious Vietnamese from here tonight. I had grilled chicken b√∫n and my friend had tofu version. Both delicious. Service was a little slow at the start but the flavours in this place were delicious in an intimate setting. Unbelievably good Vietnamese food for only $16. I really wanted 3 colour drink but they didn‚Äôt have that and no reason given why not. Overall this was a nice place and cheap dinner for excellent food, will definitely be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMXFlNVZBEAE,"Super fresh, tasty food and lovely staff."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOEt5dTFnRRAB,Loved the grilled chicken pho and crispy chicken ribs
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb1B2c0ZBEAE,"We had a wonderful dining experience here! We ordered the beef and beef ball pho, and a side order of the deep fried chicken ribs. Both were wonderful, very flavoursome, especially the chicken, so tasty! Very crispy on the outside, juicy and well-marinated inside. The husband and wife team behind thw food and service were great. Had a great chat with both of them as it was off-peak time of day. The friendly husband's culinary skills are superb and wife is very friendly and kind too. Thank you for the wonderful experience and all the best!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb0w2X3VnRRAB,Food was ok but no split bills which is frankly not legal nor acceptable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb0piQ0JBEAE,"Very well priced Pho, very tasty too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbDlXdXh3RRAB,"The best pho I have ever had , it was phokin delicious . Its like they did a research on how to make the best ever pho , with the best ingredients and the best veggies and the best everything , whilst at the restaurant I realized that ppl from the 1800s had come to savour the dishes here as well which speaks volumes about the place . Highly recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeG9uS0NBEAE,Where are you??????
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoODd5M2ZBEAE,"RACISTS!! WON'T GIVE SEATS TO ASIANS! Don't go there unless you are a racist yourself  EDITED: THIS was their response! """""" ÎπÑÏ¶àÎãàÏä§ Ï∏° ÎãµÎ≥Ä You are a sick person, and have been reported """""" THEY TRIED TO REPORT ME FOR CALLING THEM OUT! Note that they didn't object to the fact that they denied seats to Asians!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocTY3bHlBRRAB,"We went with another couple for dinner.  Our booked outdoor table was nicely prepared for us when we arrived, complete with a crisp white tablecloth.  Pleasant environment (NOT far too noisy like other restaurants).  Courteous, helpful staff.  Our Chevapchichi Sausages, Scotch Fillet, Eye Fillet, Lamb Chops and Grilled Capsicum with Feta Cheese were ALL a culinary delight.  Highly recommended for an expertly grilled gourmet meat meal.  We will definitely return !!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNF9teWN3EAE,Great quality steak but staff were so rude.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMWQ3WXBRRRAB,Was recommended to eat here by a colleague and so glad we listened! Fabulous food and great service. Will definitely be back when next in Melbourne.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaF9tYnFnRRAB,Foods so delish. I couldnt eat it all. Its a massive servings
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcC1MQ1ZREAE,"Incredibly disappointed in this dining experience. 18$ Garden salad consists of nothing but Lettuce and a few tomatoes. Asked for Cucumber to be added, but paid 4$ for it. Dressing was awful. Waitress boasted how nice it was when ordering, described there being quite a mix of Lettuce, but it was more like 2 of the cheapest type. When she followed up how we enjoyed it, I politely said I was disappointed. She rudely said others all quite like it, completely dismissing your opinion or feelings. Saw her roll her eyes as she walked away. Would never come back here, and will be sharing this message to other social media platforms. Go to Coles, buy a bag of mixed green for 5$ instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLTVxODZBRRAB,The host is super ok
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ1ltQUpBEAE,"My fave restaurant in Melbourne. I come week here weekly. The atmosphere is so welcoming and the staff are so hospitable. Especially Ang, love her! she is the best. The owner Dom aka Andrew Tate is so nice to my friends and I despite me always being late (sorry Dom) I come for the service but I stay for chicken schnitzel. Would recommend 11/10."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaF9pS0ZBEAE,Rib eye steak at ü•©ü•îü•ï Good drinks here and nice pan fried chicken livers too. Got the pepper sauce with the steak ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNVpHLTVnRRAB,Food was fantastic but would have preferred smaller steak size/cut options. Meals were very large. Service was fantastic.

Came in for dinner with my husband last night and we could not fault anything our steaks were cooked to perfection and the pepper sauce was one of the best we‚Äôve had.The grilled peppers were delicious and you can‚Äôt go past the warm bread to go with it all, we will definetely be back ."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaWFiTWhRRRAB,This is the second time we‚Äôve showed up to the restaurant for dinner and it‚Äôs been closed despite saying open 7 days a week on google. No sign to state why they are closed or when they will be open again. We came to eat on a Thursday at 7pm which should definitely be a day restaurants operate
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaUl6WGdnRRAB,"Very nice steaks ü•© & salads, cold beer üç∫ & nice desserts. Will come back for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaC1LV0pBEAE,"Stumbled across this place on Lygon st with my family. We‚Äôre holidaying in Melbourne and it‚Äôs the best meal we‚Äôve had the whole trip. Beautiful homey flavourful food. The steaks truly are the best we‚Äôve ever had, delicious salads, chicken noodle soup (soup of the day), lamb chops, and chicken & mushrooms. You can‚Äôt go wrong with anything you order. The staff are lovely and accommodating. We will certainly be recommending this place to all Melbourne goers and will be returning next time we visit the city.  The easiest 5 star review ever ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOE03QmN3EAE,"An absolutely delightful meal. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, not only with their service, but also giving helpful advice for plants to go in the city.  We ordered some curry puffs for starters, then a chicken yellow curry and a chicken cashew nut stir fry, split between four of us, for our mains.  It fed us perfectly well, leaving us full and happy. The food was beautifully cooked and was some of the best we've ever had.  By splitting the meals and only ordering one drink, we kept the bill under $80 (<$20pp) without remotely feeling like we were skimping.  There was a lovely atmosphere, both decor and music, and both indoor and outdoor seating options.  We will absolutely be back when we're next in Melbourne.  Thank you so much for a lovely evening."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteHBydnpRRRAB,"Great restaurant right in the heart of Lygon street. Came here for an easy dinner and got pad Thai and steamed vegetables, both dishes were delicious and very reasonably priced. Good portions in a friendly atmosphere, we sat inside but decor inside also looked very nice. Friendly service and quick delivery of meals too which was good since we were hungry! Also open on a Monday unlike many places so it‚Äôs always a good place to go."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1djZxWHBBRRAB,"Food was authentic, and it had great flavour in it. The staff was so accomodating as well, due to cold weather had requested if any possibility to get warm water which they were happy to help. The portion size was satisfactory as well. I am so content that I was able to try so many varieties in the restaurant"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3VhWUpREAE,"Quick service, freebies added to order on pickup. Delicious food, authentic flavours. We had pad Thai, bbq pork/tofu, chicken fried rice, tamarind prawns. Would recommend this restaurant"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmZISFZnEAE,"Probably my favourite little place to eat in Melbourne. Great atmosphere, always good service and the food is excellent.  Really good menu of simple dishes like noodles to more complex seafood dishes. Always have a good time here and the food in every dish has been great.  If you like spice, also a good place to visit as they have different spice levels. Green chili level is a mild/medium with red being the highest (and best!).  Highly recommended"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnBlR0xBEAE,"The BEST in Melbourne so far! Love the grilled beef ribs (iga bakar), the tahu telor,, ayam taliwang! üòçüòç  Fully recommended!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHRENDNBRRAB,It's delicious according to expectations when you miss Indo cuisine
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3RtRlZREAE,"One of Indonesian restaurants in Melbourne.  Their tofu egg, oxtail soup, grilled fish and crispy prawns are some of our family favs. Definitely should go here if you miss or wanna try Indonesian cuisine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkpfY2RREAE,"Always enjoyed my smashed chicken. Came here several times and I would recommend people to experience quite authentic Indonesian cuisine here! However, I find their fried food a little greasy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk1YS01REAE,Delicious! The portion and price are reasonably good. Some of the menus are worth it to try for fans of spices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2azhfbkJnEAE,"15/4/23 After my excellent experiences with this cafe in 2021, brought a group of 10 there for dinner. Sadly, although the food is still excellent, the customer service has deteoriated to abysmal. The lovely proprietor Julie wasn't there and the staff were very reluctant to inform me when I can speak to her. I had booked a table for 10 on 11/4. I spoke to Yenny and told her specifically that we want to sit outdoors. I made sure she understood my request by making her repeat back to me my request for an outdoor table. When we arrived a table was reserved for us indoors. I proceeded to speak to a middle aged woman staff who kept insisting we sit inside which to me is terrible customer service. I demanded to speak to Yenny who then agreed that we had a booking for 10 for an outside table and set it up there and then. Customers shouldn't be forced to sit indoors when they had specifically requested to sit outdoors.We then ordered our dishes together. However, the dishes came out very slowly with some at the table being served before others. I also noticed that those who came later than us got their meals served before us. That is so unacceptable. I had to confront Yenny again to request for our meals. I have eaten at many cafes and this is about one of the worst experience of being served in this manner. I asked when I  could speak to the lovely proprietor Julie but was told she will not be available on Sunday as she is at church and is not around on weekdays. I am shocked at the almost non existent customer service and the deterioration of this cafe like this. Thankfully the food is still nice or I would have downgraded this cafe's rating to 1 star.  6/2021Excellent chendol, excellent satay and rice cakes at D'Penyetz & D'Chendol. Reminiscent of my great grandmother's home cooking.Absolutely love this place. Very friendly and good service. Nothing is too hard for them. The proprietor has a smile and remembers the customer's names. This place is a gem."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0txTFVREAE,Good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdl9UZkN3EAE,"Smashed chicken wiht green chillis was great! The chicken satay sticks were god. Fried fish with chillis was a dissapointment, fish was not crispy, was very soggy and the sauce lacked punch. Service was not the best from the elderly lady."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOVpQMTRRRRAB,"I had lunch here today, and I ordered the Iga Bakar Kecap (lit. soy sauce grilled (beef) ribs) which came with sambal and little salad and 2 pieces of fried tofu with plain white rice (Nasi Putih) ($19.60). The place was bustling with people but the receptionist was kind enough to suggest me dishes and so I chose this one. I've to say, it was just so good! The sauce and seasoning was on point, the meat grilled just right and the portions were much more than I was expecting! The food didn't take long to arrive. My seat was a tad smelly, maybe because I was close to the kitchen area or the place was small with many people dunno which, but once the food arrived everything else disappearedüòÅ. I'm definitely going to visit this place again, hopefully with my friends and try out the other dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemZ2aFhBEAE,"Authentic Indonesian Ayam Penyet! Best one I've had in Melbourne. The beef ribs (Iga Bakar) was amazing as well. Be sure to get in early or call to book a seat, they fill up very quickly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMFlxbThRRRAB,"Excellent Indonesian food but management please employ at least 1 more person in fronthouse. The girl serving us is unfriendly, not even acknowledging us when walking in. This is possibly due to overwork, with only two front house staffs looking after the entire indoor and outdoor dining area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodkl5aUZ3EAE,"My favourite Indonesian restaurant outside of Indonesia. I've had it so many times through delivery, then I dined in for the first time recently and loved it even more. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMVB1R0h3EAE,"Never got my order but that's Uber Eats and the driver Jorge, Uber refunds. They drivers do it all the time i just hope the restaurant isn't out of pocket. Shame on you tourists"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUlhNzN3RRAB,"The staff doesn‚Äôt have any qualities. Very rude. The girl with the glasses brought our plates and just drop it to the table. No manners at all. Disgusting f&b service. We asked for a knife to cut our fish and chicken she said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a knife "" and left. But the food is ok.thanks to chefs"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaEppbWtnRRAB,"I went upstairs and chose my own table. There is a qrcode that you can scan, place order and pay online. Veg fried noddles was very tasty, they serve it with tofu, tempeh, crisps and pickled veg. You also get a fried egg. I would have enjoyed it more with some chilli sauce, but need to pay extra, so skipped that. Would visit again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkxmRW1RRRAB,Sweet Martabak Pandan flavour is so amazing and taste like in Indo. It is worth the wait. Cos it is freshly Made. I m happy! Thanks Martabak Peconangan 78ü§ó yg sudah hadir di Melbourne. My craving is satisfied ü§ó ‚Ä¶

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eU5HQVd3EAE,"Came there and place order at 5:30, go to an all you can eat buffet, came back here at 7 to pick it up and my food wasn‚Äôt even ready yet. Waiting for another 15ish minutes. . The martabak manis was burnt üòÇ i don‚Äôt mind waiting because i know from everybody that comes there that the waiting hour is around 2 hours but i expect it to be good. The martabak asin was quite good but the beef a bit smelly somehow. The bakmie is so so but then again, we do take away so we put it in the microwave later on which might make it taste less good than if we eat it on the spot. . Overall, i give this place a 3 star for now (middle rate), will be back in the future to try again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUpLS1ZnEAE,The Noodle Is not as good and the price is pricy for Mie Ayam! is not worth for the money. The Martabak Manis. you have to wait forever.  Not that recomand! A bit disappointed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c1BIQVJREAE,"I ordered the martabak classic and tipker at 4 pm, got it at 6 pm eventhough they said the waiting time is 1 hour in the online system. In fact, this is the worst martabak that I have ever tried and its not worth the wait. One of the staffs with glasses was very unfriendly too."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b09YcTdnRRAB,Bad experience. waiting for almost 2 hours for a burnt martabak. the woman with glasses was so unfriendly. will never go back again. dont bother and dont recommend to go here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d1B5ZUR3EAE,"Placed an order in the restaurant for Martabak Manis and Tipis Kering at 4pm (advertised opening time) and was told it would be ready by 6.30pm. We had dinner elsewhere and came back only to argue with the auntie because they had not even cooked our order yet. They then made our order right away so we got only our order by around 7pm and be told ""you are to gain 2kg tomorrow because you ordered all this"" by the same auntie - no thank you, no apologies for the long wait. Tipker was good, martabak manis was dense and okay. Negative star if possible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdi1McmxRRRAB,"It‚Äôs actually not bad for the price, but do need some improvements in the matter of quality, consistency and waiting time. The batter isn‚Äôt raising so the texture kinda solid. One of the martabak is overcooked, little bit burnt on the outside. I hope it will be improved in the next visit and serving time could be quicker, I would still give it a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajlxbEdnEAE,"Won‚Äôt come back again‚Ä¶ place order at 1:30pm, got the martabak around 3:45pm. Martabak was burnt outside and undercooked inside. Not worth the wait.. needs to improve staff and work flow, so mess‚Ä¶"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWFUcXh3RRAB,Very tasty food with good quantity.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMUp6V1ZREAE,"Beef noodle soup had no flavour or depth, very watery, the chicken noodle stir fry was disgusting, 2-3 piece of chicken and smelt off"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd1phZzhBRRAB,"delicious, reasonable price"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaEpMYjFBRRAB,Had the lunch special; very tasty and good price! Thank you guys.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNE9qMmlBRRAB,"Had crispy soft crab, it was okay but the sauce diluted with water I think? However the steamed rice with roast duck not so good, duck was dry its more like microwave duck and the rice is not hot. Presentation wise was awful the soysauce again diluted with water. Could be better for the price. Not recommend at all. Sorry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcXE2MzJBRRAB,The service is goodÔºåI spent 19 dollars buying half of a peking duck through GrouponÔºåThe duck tastes nice and will definitely will come back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbjczX3hRRRAB,"Not sure about authenticity of food. Rice rolls was so so. Nothing spectacular. The beef pho was substantial and tasty. Would have appreciated a bit more beef slices, but stock was flavourful and tasty. The spicy beef noodles was harshly spicy. Not very flavourful. A definite thumbs down. Service was pleasant but cold and disinterested.  Won't be returning nor recommending"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcWF6MHZnRRAB,"Little Vietnamese place situated in the heart of little Italy. Entree were okay. Wonton noodle soup was rated by the missus. Pho was average at best, being Vietnamese I was disappointed with the portion size and flavour. Broth was lacking and had very thin slices of beef and half a beef ball. $45 for 2 main and 2 entree was ok pricing but portion sizing was reflective of this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWU2T2p3RRAB,"Dong Phuong consistently deliver one of my fave dishes ~ the steam barramundi with ginger sauce. The chef and staff accomodated my dietary requirement and special request - nothing is missing. The tasty & flavorful XL fish arrived carefully packed and masterfully cooked.  Stay safe, well, and blessed. Til next order soon"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycTYtQ2N3EAE,"We had the Pekin duck with the pancakes and it tasted more like a roasted duck that sat in the warming counter for ages, quite dry, not soo fresh and the only thing that was in common with a pekin duck was the sauce. Unfortunately we booked with Groupon and when we looked at the menu in the restaurant the full price for half a duck was $20 which means that the discount on Groupon (half a duck for $19) is a total scam. Wouldn't recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyamZLMW13RRAB,"Would NOT recommend this resturant. Food is frozen, not properly cooked and after a dispute over the inedible dish I was served, the worker called me ""wasteful"" and  was rude assuming I had no genuine understanding of their cuisine. Not to mention that the resturant was actually closed for dine-in but we were not made aware of this when making our booking."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNUl2a0p3EAE,Not the best Vietnamese food ive had and I had to wait almost an hour for my order
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM0tiekdREAE,"Extremely disappointed. This has got to be the worst bowl of pho I‚Äôve ever had. I couldn‚Äôt even finished half the bowl, that‚Äôs how bad it was. Service is slow but staff is friendly but the pho soup literally just tasted like hot water. I tried my best to dress it up by asking for extra hoisin and chilli sauce but it didn‚Äôt taste any better. After eating a few bites I just got up, paid and left. Being a Vietnamese I want to be supportive but cooking food like this and feeding to people, this is shameful. No pride, passion or respect for Vietnamese cuisine. Such a shame."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcjZuLWxBRRAB,"Hands down the worst ""Vietnamese"" noodle salad I've ever had. Another Chinese place pretending to do other cuisines and failing"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMF8yc0VREAE,"The price is cheaper than most of Pho Noodles in the town, but the taste also poorer. The soup is not fresh and the meat also fatty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNGUyZEt3EAE,This restaurant was outstanding in value and flavour. We had the prawn spring rolls and sliced beef pho. Extremely worth for the price and food tasted excellent. A tasty broth with soft noodle and beef.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbmRIT3RBRRAB,Great food at VERY reasonable prices. Good service that would shame a lot of more upmarket places in Lygon st.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN3FuVVpnEAE,average pho
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOXBpa05BEAE,"The Pho and Wonton soup are terrible, weird smell and taste, like gone off food, I felt sick and could not sleep the whole night after eating those"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtazdPc3RBRRAB,"It's okay, ordered the Peking duck but it's not really that authentic"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLWNybjlnRRAB,Restaurant accepted my order at 9:42pm. Moved to ‚Äòwrapping up‚Äô at 10:20pm. 3 drivers went by to collect it and each time not ready. Restaurant cancelled my order at 11:18pm.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcUtHbEp3EAE,"Great pho and very nice vermicelli salad. Very fresh ingredients, tasty food, and great service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaXRicGRBEAE,"This is an honest, good old fashioned Vietnamese eating place! The staff are super friendly and helpful, the menu is long and covers everything you'd expect. Serving sizes are large and it's not overpriced. Our sweet and sour pork was a little overcooked but everything else was bang on, good flavours, nice spice and the spring rolls are amazing! Worth a visit for good Vietnamese"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHXzVubVNBEAE,Peking duck is AMAZING! Wish I could tip through Uber Eats... I will be ordering again and tipping because HOLY MOLY...Best delivery I have had in 6 months and I am a Gold Uber Eats member! Please do yourself a favour and order from here.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWNiVUF3EAE,The pretentiousness it not worth it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3U2YXdnRRAB,"Go with the Chef's Suggestions  - top quality, seasonal, well balanced. Service is a highlight - friendly, knowledgeable, helpful. Love that they have dry sherry on offer by the glass as an aperitif. It's so underrated and the perfect start to a very classy meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbHF6Qm13RRAB,The best flat bread ever! Would recommend here!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXBEZFpBEAE,"Food was excellent, chose the chefs selection. Our order must have been lost halfway through as we waited for an unusually long time, however when the staff realised they apologised and provided a free round of drinks and a free dish. The Wagu steak with the fat and sauce was just Devine."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajRQX3dBRRAB,"Food was not bad, but none of the dishes stood out for me. Also had chicken and steak, but no pics of that. Service was good, staff were tentative and were helpful in selecting the dishes and wines. Nice cosy atmosphere at night. Food: 3.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Atmosphere: 4.5/5"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTdYemZ3EAE,"always a beautiful experience at marion, these pictures are from my most recent visit, which is nice to experience a changing menu. service is always faultless, kind and extremely informative of the wine/food. attentive and friendly also. wine list is impressive and carefully selected. peppers were quite spicy and pretty average tasting, probably wouldnt get again. but everything else was impeccable as always! some of the lushest kingfish i've tried in melb not overpowdered by acidity. beetroot salad was a delight. fries are always a must - and the tiramisu, however has been served smaller and smaller with every visit! thankyou marion for your beautiful hospitality. the perfect spot to sip on wine, snack, and people watch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScS1iek5BEAE,"One of the best dinners I have been to in a long time, the food, drinks menu, service and general fitout was exceptional."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3ZqbmV3EAE,Service and food top notch. A week later and still dreaming about the steak we had.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbE1qbmlnRRAB,Bench seating at the kitchen should be by special request only. The acoustics and atmosphere of this seating was exceptionally unpleasant between both dining halls and the kitchen and almost ruined my experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVAyVDhRRRAB,"Site says outside food allowed, booked for 8, asked for cakage fee on the day of the event, they then said no outside cake, when I had already ordered a cake to bring. Misleading website, rude service as well- be warned"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b0tfWkh3EAE,"Authentic Shawarma from Jordan. As someone who grew up in the Middle East, the shawarma is really tasty and reminds me of the ones I got in the Middle East. Would recommend to anyone searching for authentic Shawarma."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d09peU5nEAE,If you are looking for Pan flavor then this is the place. They got variety of flavours on them. Best shisha in Cbd.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbl9Tcm5BRRAB,"Based on my personal experience on a Saturday night, I can only rate it 2 stars for the following 3 reasons:  1. Food quality & flavor: appetizers were almost above average, mains were bland mostly, the juices were awfully watery and tasteless.  2. Service quality: I wouldn‚Äôt say they were under staffed but having two trainees on a Saturday results in negative customer experience, orders took quite sometime to arrive and table service was below average.  3. Overall experience: food quality combined with two trainees working on a Saturday and slow customer service translates into below average experience.  Suggestions:  1. Elevate the cuisine and ensure to enforce better food quality and flavors. 2. Better train staff and ensure staffing at max one trainee on a Saturday to improve the overall customer experience. 3. Present a better management for the entire venue, the whole place seemed run chaotically.  Lastly, this is outright directed at the management and not staff level (chefs, waiters, runners) because they only execute, but it‚Äôs managements sole responsibility to oversee that execution and enforce better quality or at the least educate staff to individually supervise and take a more supervisory approach in their way of work.  Bottom line: management needs an overhaul."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSejRDRU5nEAE,"Not a good customer service, very poor presentation on the table. won‚Äôt go there again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTZDOUxnEAE,Best food ever and the services its just perfect loved everything ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeFlyVWVBEAE,"Really nice place. The shisha was great, and the staff were really courteous. The only reason I give the place a 4 stars is because it took 25 minutes to get our drinks. Otherwise, it's a really nice place to take the whole family to eat Middle Eastern food or hang out with friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX295Q3p3RRAB,"- One of the recommended place in Melbourne for Hookah lovers. - Tried a different flavor ‚ÄúPan with Blueberry‚Äù it was amazing ‚Äòhighly recommend‚Äô - Cozy place, dining downstairs and shisha upstairs only. - Turkish Coffee and Hot Chocolate are very delicious.  Note: better to pay in cash, because they are charging 10% extra for Shisha as Card Surcharge if you pay by Card."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenA3VENnEAE,"Can‚Äôt fault this place, best food in Melbourne. From the moment you walk in you are welcomed with a smile, the first thing I notice is the cleanliness, honestly you feel like you are the first person who walked in there ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Add to that the staff are attentive, the food is A+. I look forward to my next visit. Special thank you to Waleed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenREb3RBRRAB,Best food I've had in Melbourne! Solid portion sizes too. Pro tip: go with the staff recommendations.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHNMemZnEAE,Didnt have a table ready for our reservation time and 60% of the menu was sold out. This was the second time this happened. Never trying to eat here again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNkllUVNREAE,"We had an iftar buffet yesterday and I must say the atmosphere was absolutely bizarre.  They booked too many people without considering the amount of space they had. You had to wait in a long queue to get your turn which was really frustrating for the elderly people.  The walking space between tables was narrow.  In the end, there was a shameless person who was breaking the queue wearing chain in blue dress and acting like a godfather. But I wouldn't say it was management's fault.  In the end, the food was good but the service and atmosphere was bizarre. Think twice if U will bring elderly people with you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE0tR1pREAE,"Great food, Great Ambience, Great Service. Manager Sadiq & his entire team were very accomodating for my event. Highly Recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNExqTzhRRRAB,We made an online booking for my wife's 40th birthday dinner.  Only when we arrived were we told that the ala carte menu would not be available and only the buffet would be available because it was ramadan.  We looked at the buffet and we're not impressed as we really wanted to be able to order from the ala carte menu but this would mean we would have to wait over 1 hour until the other carte menu would become available.  They did apologise for the confusion and blamed their online booking system. (not good enough!)  For the sake of a quick phone call they could have called us to advise that the time we booked would not allow the ala carte menu and avoided ruining our dinner plans for my wife's special night.  Really disappointed! üòî
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSXzZPY1lBEAE,Best Arabesque restaurant in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjVYOHRRRRAB,"Good options, their mansaf takes me back to my time in the Levant. Tasty toum as well"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa18ybTB3RRAB,"Never ever recommended  A ridiculously disgusting place that anybody would ever imagine.  Customer service : horrible and very poor. Short staff always compromises the quality of the service which was quite evident in this restaurant.  Food quality : below average and we witnessed how it was cooked with rush and very less attention to the taste and quality of the food  Environment:  very tiny and no room to move around the tables. People were bumping into each other with no whatsoever privacy in their tables and sitting areas. It looked more like a college cafeteria.  The food was not enough and the plates were dirty with water leaking a around them. They didn‚Äôt even bother to dry up the plates ‚Ä¶ really disgusting  Our experience:  My family and I booked the Iftar Buffet ( Break Fast - Dinner ) Over the phone we were told 55 per head but when we reached to the restaurant they charged us more. Further to that , for Iftar, it is really important to have the food ready to be served right on time ( approximately 6pm that day ) to be served straightaway however, the dinning area was not even ready by that time. All the guest with their little ones had to be directed to a waiting area on a first floor mezzanine with a dangerous stair case. The allocated waiting area was also freezing which the families were clearly not comfortable at all. Later on when the guests were directed to down stairs to sit on their tables, the food was not yet ready‚Ä¶. Staff were rushing around . Regardless the food was also significant delayed and then once the serving began the buffet area was so tiny and never enough for that number of people at all. For instance one little soup pot was allocated for that many people ‚Ä¶ you imagine ‚Ä¶it wasted a good 15 minutes of everybody‚Äôs time for a small bowl of soup. The bowls were just washed with leaking water around them. You should have technically closed your eyes on their cleanliness otherwise you would have walked out starving ‚Ä¶  The dessert options were very limited and there was a tasteless ice tea and a disgusting whatsoever Turkish coffee ( no where near Turkish coffee ) was served  The very first time ever I could have seen that my little ones rejected the chips ( French fries ) was in this place. When I asked my child why don‚Äôt you eat your chips ‚Ä¶ they are gross and slurpy ‚Ä¶ he replied  The resentments and unhappiness was quite visible on people‚Äôs face.  Over all it was a disgusting place and never worth it for the money we paid and the time we wasted in there. A once off experience which will never ever happen again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmNmTUtREAE,Great service and good quality shisha.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3N1X25RRRAB,It was all good but the service and the area I dont recommend coming for the buffet it's extremely small and not enough food everything 30 mins they add more food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbW9hOW5BRRAB,"Ramadan All you can eat buffet is happening now for $55 from 7pm to 9pm during the Ramadan celebration period, it includes different varieties of tasty food and desserts."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOHRTS1JnEAE,The Iftar buffet was outstanding. Food was very nice and staff were super helpful. Keep it up guys
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEpidGtnRRAB,Best service they always treat me like family. I love going to this place. Great food and shisha one of my favourite places to go in Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbUtqWm5nRRAB,"We went to this restaurant on Ramdan and they had an open buffet, We were very excited to enjoy a delicious meal, but what we experienced was far from what I had expected. The food was undeniably scrumptious, but the atmosphere was terrible. The place was incredibly cramped, making it impossible to move around without constantly bumping into other diners. To add insult to injury, the whole second floor of the restaurant was left empty and unused.  When I finally made it to the buffet table after waiting in line for over 15 minutes, I discovered that many of the dishes were already empty, and the staff seemed to be taking their time to refill them. Once I finally got my food, it was cold, unappetizing, and unenjoyable.  As if that wasn't bad enough, I witnessed other diners freely helping themselves to drinks from the fridge, so I decided to do the same. However, after finishing ten bottles, I was told that I had to pay for all the drinks I had taken, even though there was no signage or indication that there was a charge for drinks.  we left the restaurant feeling extremely disappointed and angry that I had wasted my time and money on such a poorly-managed and unenjoyable dining experience.  Do not come here for Ramdan open buffet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeU5mVmF3EAE,"Good middle eastern cuisine, the restaurant held a buffet style meal for dinner as part of Ramadan, so we got to taste a bit of everything."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdC1UaXFnRRAB,Nice Irish pub with a cute little roof garden...goid selection on tap
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMDVIN0FnEAE,"I‚Äôm a simple man.   Maybe that‚Äôs my problem. They didn‚Äôt want me around.  I guess it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not pretty or good looking and such.   Happy to spend my well earned coin on St Pats day but I didn‚Äôt have a ticket. The crux of it is we were here at 10am, no ticket for the arvo session supposedly but they still kicked us out at 4pm.  It was a ticketed event supposedly! St Patrick doesn‚Äôt do ticketed events.  That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs a Saint."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaWJudF9RRRAB,"I love potato chips and am aware of the shortage, so even though I haven‚Äôt seen a price increase at other places yet other than here, these authentic cut potato chips were definitely worth it! Thick cut, so crispy with the skin on and perfectly seasoned. Didn‚Äôt need any tomato sauce, enjoyed it much better without. And then we tried the curry and cheese version- honestly so delicious!! We appreciated the Irish tunes as well. Good little gem üëçüèº"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoenNEbDhBRRAB,"Small, intimate location. Food was lovely even though the menu is quite limited (esp for those with an allergy, to gluten in our case). But the staff were extremely friendly and accomodating and music was fantastic and lively. Drinks list was also great."

Mine arrived lukewarm and my friends was in good temp. I ordered a bacon and egg roll and it was honestly just ok, bacon was a bit cold and felt too dry.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEtXaFp3EAE,Amazing pizza! Eating it now :) so many VEGAN and non vegan options. Friendly staff! Dog friendly ü´∂ only thing is atmosphere could be better but who cares when food is good!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodkxxbDBBRRAB,"If you are looking for the best Pizza in town, I would recommend DUKE PIZZA! I love Duke Pizza because the taste is very niceeee, good service, hygiene and friendly staff. Especially, they have the special deal every Wednesday and Thursday that I never missed it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocVA3Z1lnEAE,"I'd say it's okay, not bad but to be fair it should be said their pizzas quality is really average, like it is better than Domino or hot pizza for sure but not better than even a bit more premium brands like crust and surely not better than good Italian restaurants. Pizzas are big and filling. The shop is like more street shops, not a place you want to sit and have lunch or dinner but they have tables if you really feel like sitting there and have your pizza over there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbjk2OFlBEAE,Beautiful pizza! The vegan options were super tasty. Such a cute little shop too with friendly staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd1BLZWV3EAE,Amazing vanilla slice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcnFpOExBEAE,"Just ordered it through Uber eats. The photos online look good. So decided to try something new. But it was awful. There was barely any topping, it was dry and cold. I even ordered extra cheese and it was just thin and dry. Waste of money"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcXJqRnVnRRAB,"The boss was ridiculous, he really had a bad attitude towards customer. Please avoid going to this pizza store"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOE56VXBBRRAB,"The vegan truffle pizza we ordered was super delicious. One 13"" pizza was sufficient for two moderately hungry people. The place could definitely have offered more vegan options, otherwise I would have given it a full 5 for food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNktxcTVRRRAB,"The best pizza I had ever. 24‚Äù is one of the biggest pizza I saw. Really tasty, nice hand stretched base and friendly staff.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyazVqbENBEAE,I love Duke pizza especially their BBQ meatlover pizza. I always get it when I order there.  They‚Äôre so generous with their toppings and the taste is unprecedented. It‚Äôs my guilty pleasure.  They also have deals every Wednesday (a dollar an inch) and Thursday (buy 2 get 1). So I make sure to buy pizza on those days.  The service is also fantastic. They‚Äôre friendly and speedy.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbXEzalp3EAE,Decent slices
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM0xYUXhnRRAB,Its an experience. Would recommend the 24 inch  for 4 people and definitely get half half. Will definitely be coming back

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzg2dFRREAE,"Classic burgers, can't go wrong with getting your burger fix here. Quick service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjhQaGdnRRAB,"Burgers were fantastic! Priced well for what you get, started at $11, super filling too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWZUUk93EAE,"Good burgers, nit a fan of the buns but the burgers are still good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod2R5Ty1BRRAB,"Forgot our food, disgusting corn with crushed up stale Doritos or ccs I can‚Äôt tell. The corn Is colder than brisk dark night mid July in melbourne. Heaving red onion chunks on the below freeze temperature burger, stale cookies. Curry and turmeric flavored Mac and cheese balls no cheese in sight still searching for it? Pickles that look like they just came from the chum bucket. The only good thing about my $78 order is the freshly cracked can of coke. Ah well nothing a frozen pie and a coke can‚Äôt fix"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodk5pZ0F3EAE,"First time here. Been waiting for 20mins and asked for checking my order for twice. Told me I‚Äôll be the next and and will be ready in 1 mins. Told me they did not skip my order. But everyone ordered after me got their food and finished and I‚Äôm still waiting here. Really bad!  Finally I got my order and it‚Äôs a wrong order. I asked for no sauce but there was clearly mayo on the burger. I asked for refund and the manager gave me the refund. He said next you order ask for how long is the wait time and long wait time is not a reason to get refund. Yes you don‚Äôt tell your customers who are mainly students and normally have a short lunch or afternoon break that some burgers take 20 mins to cook. Yes your customers have the responsibility to know how long your burgers will take to cook and it‚Äôs their responsibility to not know your long cooking time. BTW like you said long wait time is not a reason to get a refund. If I don‚Äôt ask for a refund, would you remake the wrong order for me and I would expect another 20 mins waiting?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa0pQLVJnEAE,Extremely Tasty Burger and was cooked perfectly. The sauce was nice and sweet. If there was a little more freshness like another pickle or two or even some lettuce then it would be a five everyday of the week.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWJHZGlnRRAB,Cheesy mofo double patty with kombucha. Yum!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocUpESWZREAE,Picked up an order from here and omg please I travelled to heaven and back the second I took a bite the breakky burger threw me a ticket to see Jesus for a split second. Y'all bussin' ü§ù
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoME1qcVdnEAE,"I love Mofo cheesy burger, worker is friendly"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNzVmTE5nEAE,I think this place may have been sold or something. The quality and taste was 5 star all the way through the lockdowns. But the last few months the quality has deteriorated. Chicken in burgers are now dry and overcooked. Slaw in the burger seems to be the bitter cabbage stalks. Chips have gotten thinner and soggier too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc192d25RRRAB,"Before I went, I looked at the reviews and photos on Google, it looked good, but it turned out to be the worst burger place I have ever eaten, so disappointed. 1. The chicken in the chicken burger was dry, stale and cold,. 2. The beef in the beef burger is neither fragrant nor salty, and it is very greasy. I really don't want to waste food, but I really can't eat it. 3. The decoration is very comfortable, but unfortunately the table depth is very shallow and it is not comfortable to sit on. There are not many seating options, because the closer to the kitchen, the more oily the floor, and the oily floor. 4. The better ones should be considered chips (it can be hotter and crispier for better taste), thickshake is also good, but the artificial flavor of strawberry syrup is too strong."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCczlPOS1nRRAB,"The fried chicken burger, chicken is dry and cold, purple cabbage is so bitter. Classic Angus beef burger is like good quality MacDonald's one. Strawberry thick shake test pretty chemical, just like the cheap strawberry ice cream. The chips is the best part of the whole meal. By the way the music there is fine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb3V2ZVN3EAE,Tasty burgers
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbTRiOWdRRRAB,"This place changed my life. Very good burgers, i got the double mofo, i highly recommend you try the same if you are a fan of meat and bbq sauce."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNjl1UnVnRRAB,"I'm still craving the butternut strawberry shake, it was delicious! Mac and cheese balls were really tasty, they're actually made with pumpkin, so not exactly what I was expecting. Chips were average, I wouldn't get them again. We all really enjoyed our burgers! Overall a great dinner and will come back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta0xIX2ZnEAE,"Burgers and fries here are awesome! Chocolate milkshake was not really my thing, since it had that kind of chocolate syrup taste. I‚Äôm sure others might disagree though"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNkpfZm9RRRAB,Their basic beef burger is actually incredible. Exactly what the doctor ordered
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMEt5a3hRRRAB,Never fails this MOFO. Best burgers around Carlton.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOW9iaDN3RRAB,"This is an amazing place but however their chicken burger was not really good, not even good enough to eat but their fries + beef burger was amazing. We had a good time other than that burger which we had to throw it away, no idea if that one was halal old chicken something but we couldn‚Äôt eat it, it was so bad.  The environment is good, and they have amazing staff too. They have this small pac-man game too which is fun too  Food 7/10 Staff 9.5/10 Environment 10/10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdy1LamFBEAE,"The DIY temaki set was a fun experience ! I felt like it was great value for what you get, and honestly I'm the type of person that likes to taste a lot of different things. It felt very nourishing and I felt full afterwards.  The beef tartare was also another highlight.. who knew that sweet potato could be so crispy??  I felt like the brocollini was okay.  Overall super cute experience, and you can head downstairs for some amazing ice cream ü§©"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVpMTkpREAE,We had the most beautiful experience here this week. The restaurant fit out is beautiful and creates a calm and comfortable vibe. All the food was beautifully presented and delicious. The sake was good and we got very knowledgeable explanations and recommendations by the friendly staff. Can't wait to go back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDVfSGVnEAE,"Love this cosy sake bar. Food is geared towards snacks and tamaki (freshly wrapped sushi). Snacks were awesome, my favourite being chawanmushi.  We also had a few different flights of sake. The team will show the sake bottles and explain the history and flavour profile, which I found fascinating. Definitely recommended but note that the food portion is similar to tapas than mains."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoenZUam9nRRAB,Very friendly service and delicious fresh food - really like the attention to detail! Would love to see some old menu items back though (triangular menu). Overall would recommend for a special night out.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHFtcHJnRRAB,What an amazing experience! The food tastes incredibly good and Hokkai is a boom!!!! It‚Äôs so good! Make sure you order this when you visit! And the stafff are so friendly! Love the dining experience here ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHFuUWpnRRAB,"Amazing foodddd, love the service. Everything was great for dinner"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMUltQ193RRAB,"Loved this place when it first opened, but left dinner hungry and disappointed.  Food didn‚Äôt taste as fresh as it used to, cocktails were underwhelming and portions were quite small. Had to repeatedly ask for our drinks, which arrived halfway through the meal, and we were incorrectly charged for a number of dishes. The wait staff were friendly but we ended up grabbing a bite on the way home.  A lovely space with nice furnishing, but for $350 (3 ppl) we expected better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMzRDT1pREAE,"I don't usually give bad review but this was a poor dining experience. 1 star only for the service which was great.  Everything else was below average. You cannot be charging those prices for the portions and ingredients you serve.  I am not sure what the previous menu was but this one is very poor and offers no value if you are dining in here.  Two Temakis (small size) costs you at least $36+ depending on the filling.  The ""large"" plate was not large. We had the chicken dish and it was more of a small plate rather. A daylight robbery given that it was almost $40 (not even half a chicken).  Spending $150+ for two people and still getting hungry.  Avoid if you can unless you go to drink sakes or want to empty your wallet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX2N5eE5BEAE,"~Dined here about a month ago~ The service was lovely. Please don‚Äôt take this as a rip against the staff.  We spent about $170 between two people, NOT including share plates. The new menu is nowhere near as good as it was. Limited dietary options and overpriced for what it is. Hopefully a review of the current menu is done and Leonie can return to the fantastic stuff they‚Äôre known for!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWJibDBRRRAB,"Unjustifiable prices for the tiniest of portions and meh food. I could not believe our meal cost $125 for 2 sushi hand rolls (no Temaki is worth $20‚Ä¶ cmon) 2 oysters, 2 cigar sticks the size of my pinky, 3 chicken wings and a snack plate of chicken skin & dried crab sticks (?). Indifferent to the sushi hand rolls you can get from Sushi Jiro. Absolutely bonkers to think you can charge those exorbitant prices for very average unmemorable food, especially in a food city like Melbourne. The only positive was the level of service provided and the waiter who also apologised profusely after I gave feedback of the portion sizes (which he said ‚Äúwe get this alot‚Äù). Completely unacceptable!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob1ktOEV3EAE,"Love it! It was our second time dining here and the service, food, sake choices and atmosphere have been incredible. Our waiter was knowledgeable, great to chat to and he made some wonderful recommendations. Cannot wait to come back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMF91dkJnEAE,"Great food, great drinks - really good experience overall. Nathan was super friendly and helpful, taking the time to share his recommendations and explain the different sake/umeshu flavours. Esp recommend the octopus cups and chicken wings!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ2M2OER3EAE,"Excellent decor and photo worthy food. The salad pictured was easily the most tasteless dish of the night. I lived in Japan for 3.5 years and speak Japanese. Know the food quite well...  This places tries very hard to make ‚ÄúJapanese food‚Äù. But is not even close. Paid $170 for 2 of us.  Actually left hungry and got fried chicken on way home.  The only thing missing is a chef that can cook. Service, ambience, music was very nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeTZhWjh3RRAB,"Everything was thoroughly delicious from the  food to the drinks. Portions are quite small, and price tags are high though so coming here is definitely more of an occasional treat for me"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNXBiUVVnEAE,"I never leave any review in Google map restaurants but I really love this Japanese restaurant, there interior design comfortable, everyone customer enough room for seat, service is nice. I recommend it.24/12/2022"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtajZyNXdRRRAB,"What a little gem hidden upstairs of the popular Japanese bento/dessert place, Hareruya. Apparently the owner/founder of Leonie Upstairs is also behind the cafe 279 and Le Bajo Milkbar.  This place serves a variety of small Japanese nibbles including takowasa, karaage, ebi mayo, etc. They also make to order different types of maki sushi which are also fantastic.  The beverage menu is extensive and features never ending list of sake and other Japanese drinks including high ball, umeshu, and so on.  With minimalistic, wooden and warm interior decor (as is typically the case with many Japanese places), the staff are also highly professional, polite and full of knowledge. Louie, in particular, took a good care of us and I'd like to praise him for his service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOTVTLXR3RRAB,"My friend and I came by to try some of sake from their extensive drinks menu. They also offer flights of 3 different sake that explore offerings of particular styles, regions or breweries. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about the selection of sake available; Nathan, Sean and Ryan were particularly lovely. The place is small, cozy and the vibe is fantastic, perfect for a couple of drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNWFla0p3EAE,"i'm from sydney and came with my friends with high expectations after hearing about it from tiktok and the expensive prices. happy to say that it did not disappoint! i feel that the service really made our night, as the male server was super friendly and enthusiastically spoke to us when explaining the intro to sake float. the food was amazing as well and we all thoroughly enjoyed the chawanmushi and hand rolls. i walked out with a full belly and more knowledge on sake which was great! can't wait to be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcU1lOHl3RRAB,"The sake and snacks here are unreal! Leonie has an incredibly thoughtful and extensive sake menu, and extremely knowledgable staff to take you through it all. The snacks are so good, I always go back for the temaki and blue cheese cake."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNzU3RW1RRRAB,"ORDERED: üêü‚Äã Saba miso pate: miso mackerel, ginger, onion, cheese, pie pastry üç≥‚Äã Chawanmushi: egg, salmon roe, eel, prawn, scallop, yuzu, beans, carrot, beans, chestnut, shiitake  üç£ Hokkai Temaki: salmon + roe, scallop tartar, yuzu koji ($20.00) üç£ Engawa Temaki: flounder fin, yuzu kosho, spring onion ($16.00) üç£ Kani Temaki: softshell crab, crab miso, curry mayo and greens ($16.00)  ‚Äã‚Äãüç∂‚Äã Fruit Liqueur Flight: Umenoyado Ringo Apple, Amabuki Apollon Blood Orange & Kzaemon Shiroku Junmai Kabosu  REVIEW: From the fantastic mind that brought us 279, Le Bajo Milkbar and Hareruya pantry comes Leonie Upstairs.  With its strong Japanese background, Leonie offers something new. Hand rolled sushi was only familiar to me from cheaper joints (like Sushi Hotaru) which is the point of focus for this dine in experience. From the Temaki selection, I really enjoyed the Hokkai Temaki. Every bite delivered a burst of fish roe and creamy salmon slices which kept things delicious and memorable. There's a certain unparalleled taste when it comes to simple food. On the other hand, this is the most loaded chawanmushi I've ever had. There's a lot going on, and I'm spoilt for choice with every bite. Still silky, it's definitely worth getting. Combined with an interesting and very affordable option to try sake, it's definitely a unique experience to hit Melbourne's dining scene.  Shout out to Nathan, who provided the best service!  However, there were some elements which didn't make this a 5: 1. Counter seating is too low. It was nice to know the faces behind the production of my Temaki, but found that the partition was too high/ seats were too low where I couldn't see the magic behind the scenes. Was let down by this. 2. Temaki had too much rice for the price tag that it puts out. Would've expected more of the dishes which made it unique to be front and centre, or if possible, even bigger handrolls. 3. The pie pastry with the pate is an interesting concept. The miso mackerel is a delicious pate but gets overwhelmed by the buttery-ness of the pastry. Would suggest a plainer/simpler bread instead, to really let the pate shine through. Pie pastry was great on its own though!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M01MTGx3RRAB,"Creative and yummy Japanese inspired flavours! Everything is good, but highly recommend the Genmaicha (comes with black sugar drizzle and embedded bits of tiny mochi). The calpis and pineapple is refreshing, with very strong notes of üçç ‚Ä¶"

Highly recommend the matcha mochi cookie and love the little bentos. Also love the mochi ice cream with very unique Japanese flavours. I had the genmaicha with mochi + kuromitsu, and the shiro Goma (white sesame) and it was delicious!  Not a huge fan of the Castella and the brownie but the other things are great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbktLVVBREAE,Hmm suddenly felt lucky to go directly into the store without queuing hhh Especially that layer of glutinous rice cakes! Ice cream without glutinous rice cakes has no soul!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbEtYU3dRRRAB,"Hands down one of the best matcha ice cream I have ever had outside of Japan!  I was visiting my cousin's family for a few days on holiday and she talked about this place a couple times. We made our way into central Melbourne one night after some dinner and so glad we did because the strong matcha ice cream was honestly incredible!  The queue was extremely long presumably because of how popular and well-known this shop is and I noticed that it's basically only Asians queueing so I knew it would be authentic.  We waited for approximately 30 minutes and the staff members were so patient and friendly with us while my niece and nephew tried out different flavours before deciding which ones to go for. A shout-out to the staff who gave them stickers while we waited for our ice cream to be ready, really appreciated that!  The strong matcha flavour was so rich and strong indeed as the name suggested and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My family also enjoyed the pineapple and calpico flavour, for some reason the two flavours really worked and it was so refreshing!  If I ever do come back to Melbourne, I will for sure visit this place again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk5lM3NRRRAB,Kind staff and all of the flavour pairings are phenomenal and up to date
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk5iNUR3EAE,The gelato is great.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUx6cmpBRRAB,The sweetness is just right! Be sure to add mochi skin to enhance the tasteüëç Every flavor I bought is delicious üòã
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd082TVBBEAE,"Tastey ice cream, love sesame and hojicha flavour"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbl9lb2h3RRAB,"The original mochi wrapped icecream‚Ä¶ coming from someone from Sydney‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs got very thin chewy mochi skin with solid serving icecream sizes, the matcha flavour was good but the pineapple calpis one was SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD wow delectable yummy so refreshing!! There‚Äôs always a line but it‚Äôs alright because it moves relatively quickly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajh6YTd3RRAB,Interesting place for ice cream.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkpQLVRBEAE,"If I could have any dish in the world, it would be a chicken parma from the Universal Restaurant, Carlton, before new management had completely ruined the experience. The $16.90 delicacy was an integral symbol of Melburnian culture: with dozens of people willing to line up every night for a taste of this sovereign panacea.  Served on a plate the size and shape of Captain Cook's vessel, this fat piece of golden breaded goodness laid on top of beer-battered chips as well as herbs and vegetables imported directly from the home of the parma, Italy.  The first bite of this bonne bouche is indescribable. Friends of mine and fellow parma enjoyers have related it to the innocence of their first love; reminiscent of a time before responsibility, a time before evil had established its presence in our world. As the melted cheese and tomato sauce penetrates the top of your tastebuds, the chicken cooked to perfect and the breadcrumbs launch an unwavering assault on the rest of your mouth, resulting in an intangible emotions of pure bliss taking over your body. Each bite of the meal evokes a fresh tenderness: almost as if Italy herself was embodied every time your tongue caressed the chicken. Paired with a $9 milkshake more expensive that a VCAT human rights claim, the Universal experience cannot be described as anything but divine.  In recent, unfortunate days, however, our beloved Universal experience has been corrupted. With the grace of malaria, the new management has caused an absolute degeneration of quality. My latest experience with Universal will most definitely be my last.  I was expecting pure bliss as my mouth opened to take my first bite of my parma.  I was not expecting it to taste like fish.  Confused with the stark contrast between horrid taste in my mouth and the unassuming piece of deception in front of me, I double, triple, and quadruple checked my order before the realisation of how far the greatness of this sanctuary has fallen. I felt an transcendental feeling of betrayal, worse than how Jesus must have felt when he felt Judas' kiss. It was then when I realised that my childhood was coming to a close; the cold, bleak reality of adulthood was starting to settle in.  I long for a taste of the universal chicken parma. The taste of my childhood innocence."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck0yVWp3RRAB,"We ordered the garlic pizza as an appetizer, and it was absolutely amazing. The chicken schnitzel dish was incredibly generous in size and could easily satisfy two people. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the restaurant and highly recommend it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE4zWjJnRRAB,The food is really good I love it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d042M2dRRRAB,Absolutely delicious...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjhpLUlREAE,busy not  that friendly but food was so good :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzRDSWF3EAE,We chose this place because it already had a queue outside. Food was excellent

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDVxckNBEAE,Cheap snitzels
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDlqUGN3EAE,Very affordable and not too bad for the price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczY2aEpnEAE,Great food and authentic taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDRieGZ3EAE,Delicious pizza. Pleasant staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN2FEVjBBRRAB,"Love the meat lover pizza, literally there's lots of meat on the pizza."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmJiNk93EAE,Awesome food and good vibe
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWJ6cGt3RRAB,Risotto was good with lots of prawns. Chicken parma was also good but if the chips are seasoned (at least salt) it‚Äôd be great for me
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWVES0h3EAE,Best value parmas in Melbourne (even if they do put the ham on top of the cheese...)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXZmN0d3EAE,Loved it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNzlPNVl3EAE,Best African food and amazing friendly atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNDRXR253RRAB,Best African dishes in Town. Excellent Cook..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtekxLNHN3RRAB,"Great shisha, good bartending service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlM09hQUlREAE,Nice venue for afro beats. Can be absolutely empty inside so check before you proceed. Regardless the team is nice and welcoming. We danced our carbs away from our feasting on Lygon!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdWJxVXBnRRAB,Used to be a low-key bar in a residential area but has been newly converted into a trashy nightclub. There‚Äôs no respect or regard for any of the nearby residents that have to hear music blasting until 3am every weekend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXajRmQUxnEAE,Fun Bachata class and social. Great venue with affordable drinks üç∏ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMHF5NU13EAE,"Great bar,but crowed is no good,too many negative people.not for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHamFhN2VREAE,gooooooood
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxay1Hb0ZBEAE,Terrible night club. Very dirty
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxN3IybzRnRRAB,Bartender and staff were good however ... The drinks is ...XXXXXXXX Not recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcDR1V0F3EAE,Bartenders are amazing and helpful. Just need to work on some constant and organize music during the open times.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeWQyN3R3RRAB,Went for a comedy show on level 3. No air con. Fans were not even turned on. People jammed in like sardines and it was unbearably hot that night. Run down bar that needs attention.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMkllcWFnEAE,Quirky industrial vibes in the attic. Had a nice vibe to it but could do with some extra decor in the stairwell going up.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eDhfREx3EAE,"No longer the classy cokctail piano bar, it's a night club.  We did not get the chance to explore their drinks menu nor their nibbles (if any) as I was manhandled out of the club after being let in, ordered my drink, and sat down."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeGFyYmtRRRAB,"The bartender was instantly friendly and helpful with helping us choose drinks, we had a really great time here almost instantly. Absolutely recommend especially if you're in need of some top tier drink recommendations. I can't even begin to describe how much my partner and I enjoyed this, honestly one of the best places we have ever visited."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb29xVjV3RRAB,Excellent dining experience. Host was exceptional.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWYzdDd3RRAB,"Fine dining, tasting menu, with Japanese influence. Couldn't say no to all the add ons! So how was it? First up - the snacks - There were A LOT of snacks. Most of which were great, if not a little too heavy.  The bread was delish and the butter was very ""nori-ed"" - for lack of a better term. The add-on omellete was fluffy and yum with generous serves of crab. Perhaps the most disappointing dish was the A5 Wagyu - it didn't melt much and was very meaty in its taste.  Overall a great menu - we were completely stuffed by the end - it was a very filling tasting menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHFfNVdREAE,"Food are delicious,  staff are friendly. Love this place and I will recommend to my friends  ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0tuWHdBRRAB,"Our favourite restaurant in Melbourne. Chef Kazuki and his wife Saori are such an asset to the hospitality industry, and their team are wonderful. Food is always thoughtful, creative and beautifully presented. Can‚Äôt wait to come back once again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodF9MMzFRRRAB,"Kazuki captures native Japanese food and pairs it with the best Australian produce. Chef Kazuki strives for balance and simplicity.  The snacks were presented all at once, which was a pleasant surprise. Seeing the detail of every dish really showcased their refined skills. Every little bite was done extremely well. Little savoury explosions of flavour!  For mains, there wasn‚Äôt a single dish that we didn‚Äôt like. Everything was balanced and presented beautifully. Kingfish paired fantastically with the buttermilk and mango. The lobster was outstanding, probably the highlight dish for me from the tasting menu. For the duck dish, Kazuki served 2 different parts which is very rare in most restaurants. Most restaurants default to the breast but Kazuki took it one step further to include a thigh piece, which is a plus in my books.  We added the infamous omelette with the crayfish. This has been on their menu for a very long time so we had to try it. It was ridiculously good - every bite was savoury, rich, sweet, delicate and decadent.  The desserts were great finishers to the meal. Not only are they beautifully presented but they tasted phenomenal. The cocktails were also right up our alley.  Highly recommend trying Kazuki‚Äôs if you haven‚Äôt."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodV9fMXhRRRAB,Fantastic meal. While not cheap it was hard to fault anything. Great for a special occasion.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobHJuWHJRRRAB,"What an amazing experience. Interesting food with incredible flavours and fantastic service. I felt the proportions went a little far when something on my entree plate was replaced (due to my dietary issues) with half a mini spring roll with carrot and cucumber... why couldn't I have a whole one? After 7 courses, I was just full enough but ended up eating again soon after the meal. It wasn't enough for me, and there was no option of additional food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodktiMFFBEAE,"Unbelievable meal.   So delicate, so complex, just wonderful flavors.  A great wine/sake pairing as well.   And amazing service.  A must try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMzVHallnEAE,"Food 4/5 Service 2/5 Ambiance 3/5  Food - yes it's good. It's not exceptional but it is pretty good. Def much better Japanese food in Melb.  Service - pretty poor tbh. A few times I tried to get attention and there were the 3 mains staff in the bar chatting ignoring everyone. One guest at our table asked for a scotch on the rocks.  We suggested trying a shot of Japanese whisky and the bartender/owner? said he would select one which we agreed to as we don't know anything about whisky and said we hadn't looked at the menu. Well the guy decided to take advantage of our ignorance and give us the most expensive shot of whisky on the menu - $120/shot. Felt like the sort of scam you hear in Greek island bars.  Secondly, our group of 4 was having great conversation which the staff constantly insisted on interrupting to agonisingly explain exactly what was already written on the menu. And whenever we asked further detail about what an ingredient was, they didn't even know! So what was the point?  Ambiance - from our table in centre of restaurant, we watched the kitchen staff eating food and also the cars tearing up Lygon st. Decor is trying to be minimalist Japanese but comes across like a bland business motel.  Overall ovoid"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHRxRXRBRRAB,"We had a very good dining experience, our menu is from February 11, the menu as a whole is advancing in layers, our favorite is the swordfish, its transparent tomato jelly is simply the biggest surprise, all dishes have different layers and details, the service as a whole is also very attentive, the only regret is that the waiter seems to be forcing to recommend additional dishes for the synergy menu, this is also understood at the end."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXAyaU5nEAE,"This was an amazing experience. Well out of my usual budget, but well worth it for a special occasion. We had the set tasting menu 7 perfectly designed dishes presented beautifully all amazing to eat‚Ä¶real food. The drink paring menu was special too. The whole party enjoyed every dish‚Ä¶ ( even those who usually think chicken schnitzel and chips is exotic). Each dish and drink was explained when served. A tour through food sensations."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcTdybzNnRRAB,"I was quite excited to try Kazuki as it was named the top 50 restaurants in Melbourne by Broadsheet. Great ambience and service was excellent, the staffs were friendly and courteous. My friend and I had the 7course menu which I‚Äôve included in the photo album attached to this review, and we felt that the specials that were not on our menu were the highlights of the night. We went for the 2/3 specials namely the Omelette with lobster bisque and the Wagyu. Oh and the house-made bread was delicious. We ended up consuming so much more carbs from the bread that they kept offering to us. Everything else was okay. Only let down was the lamb and the desserts. The fish was perfectly cooked but the condiments didn‚Äôt go well together; the abalone and scallop dish was lovely. There were a good selections of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks. Presentation of the food was great. Overall experience and taste of food 3.8 out of 5."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCemNydlJBEAE,"Extraordinary food, wine, service and surroundings in the heart of Carlton."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbE5iWURnEAE,"Visited this place last night, which was incredible with everything. Their finger food was delicious and perfect with all the ingredients. My fav one was the ox tongue. While the kingfish with green mango were great combination. Though my fav one was swordfish with eggplant. The only deducted point was because I‚Äôm not cheese person. Which served as their first dessert course."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeVBTNkRREAE,"Had a great night by staff‚Äôs superb services, and also Mr kazuki‚Äôs brief explaining on every courses from kitchen, great wine line and oh boy that koshu was packed with umami, toilet located upstairs was cozy, was going to toilet before first course stumbled them walking out to serves first course, immediately they made a u-turn back to kitchen just to wait for me to finish with the toilet businesses, that alone ladies and gentlemen was the greatest impression of me towards kazuki‚Äôs, very thoughtful, also special mention their‚Ä¶.  Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter! Seaweed butter!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdDh6dGFBEAE,"Delightful atmosphere, delightful staff. I love the karaage here!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQta2ZmbVZ3EAE,"Overall tasty tasting menu. Loved most of the menu, the only thing was that the salmon dish was a little bit 'normal' for that price tag. Friendly service. However noted that the wait in between food got longer and longer as the night progressed which was a little annoying. Our guess is that the chef might have staggered it so that items can be cooked at same time...this means guests that arrive earlier might actually end up finishing more or less same time as others who started later.  This meant the whole dinner took over 3 hours...a suggestion to the waitresses would be to ask guests re the speed of serving up they would prefer.  This was the third time dining at Kazukis, looking forward to the next time ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNDdQVTFnRRAB,"Good food, excellent service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMHJxRmh3RRAB,Perfect food. service and wine matching for our degustation dinner. Worth a visit.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaE42dHBnRRAB,Amazing food and service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMks2Z2F3EAE,"An excellent fine dining restaurants with Japanese influence.  Service is attentive and efficient. Food ingredients are of a high quality, and most dishes are well thought out with interesting flavours and fantastic presentation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aV9EdDNBRRAB,"Wow, what an amazing experience. Kazuki's is fine dining without the excessive bells and whistles - just quality food that speaks for itself (but also thank you to the wonderful service staff that introduced each dish). An intimate dining space that somehow feels simultaneously fancy and homey. The wait staff were welcoming, attentive and knowledgeable. The way they talked about each dish and recommended drink pairings really showed off their familiarity with the menu and love for the restaurant. THE FOOD! I have had my fair share of Japanese fine dining, but Kazuki's almost immediately took a top spot in my mind. Each dish seemed meticulously prepared to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients. The chef simply showcased their creativity without excessiveness. I won't comment on each dish as they were all amazing, but know that you should definitely visit if given the opportunity. The experience was well with the price! Looking forward to returning when we get a chance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1czllb3dBRRAB,"A small fine dining restaurant serving a five or seven course menu (only seven course for dinner), located on a busy section of Lygon Street. Had the seven course tasting menu which consisted of the following:  - Starters; there were seven bite size snacks, all were very tasty. Favourite was the spanner crab with sea grapes and the chicken pate puff - Bread roll was ok but the squid ink seaweed butter was unique with a distinct umami flavour - First dish after the starters was an eggplant wrapped in kombu, topped with toro, avocado and caviar. The top was rich, creamy and fatty, packed with flavour which was balanced with a soft vinegary base - Second dish was sliced abalone with mix vegetables, enoki mushroom and amaebi, tossed in a savory buttery sauce and topped with fried crunchy amaebi head. A pretty hearty dish - Third dish was a steamed hapuka filet with seaweed dust and scallop wrapped in leafy greens with parsnip sauce. Fish was moist, tender and meaty; paired well with the herby wrap filled with soft scallops - Fourth dish was a duck breast which was cooked well with a slightly crisp skin. The fried kale added a nice crispy texture; shaved truffle was very aromatic and the citrus jam made the dish more interesting with the sweet and savory flavour profile - First dessert was a light sponge cake with a brillat-savarin French cheese centre, served with finger lime and cream. Cheese was very strong and pungent, though the finger lime did help slightly - Second dessert was a flaky pastry filled with caramelised dice apple; texture wise it was great but the filling was too sweet and tart. Chestnut ice cream was mild in flavour; pomegranate jelly and avocado puree felt random and didn't really enhance the dish - Petit four was a dark chocolate truffle and a sweet rice crisp which was very crunchy  Overall food was great and the staffs were friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. Wasn't fond of the desserts."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1enNtSkd3EAE,"Average at best. Super friendly service, set menu was $200+ . Quality ingredients but unfortunately the flavors did not peak my curiosity‚Ä¶  Not sure Kazuki focusing on Japanese flavor or western"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dTQ2RGx3RRAB,"Extraordinary good. The quality of food is very high, matched with a fabulous wine list, and attentive service. One of the best lunches I‚Äôve had in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1azdmMWdRRRAB,"We took our oncology staff out for dinner . Service was slow . Food inconsistent . I spent over $ 5,000 on bill. Staff forgot to serve one guest desert . I asked waiter Alex for the additional serving to be provided and he snapped that they don‚Äôt have 25 pairs of hands and we need to wait . I questioned his authenticity and he remonstrated Absolutely no way we shall ever return A low class restaurant . Poor attitude . Go elsewhere . Do not recommend ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDczTThnRRAB,"With all due respect, the food is very bad and we hope it will improve in the future. Madgout with chicken, strong sauce taste and dry chicken And the chicken mandi has neither smell nor taste  I wished that I would not write the comment here, and I tried to call and advise him on the phone, but he did not answer"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWNuZF9RRRAB,"Not real authentic mandi, meat quantity was tiny and not tender at all, very dry meat. Chicken was also dry and the spices are nothing like original Yemen and Saudi mandi. I understand there are limited options for mandi in melbourne but they need to up their game. Disappointed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGU2Ny1RRRAB,"Very disappointed with the chicken mandi we ordered for take away, the rice was extra salty , no flavour , chicken just felt boiled in coloured salt water. Very disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd1BfX0dnEAE,It's just one visit to this place. Tried their kunafa which was good. Will update the rating for food after trying their signature dishes soon.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOVpUOTJ3RRAB,"Tried Ramadan Iftar open buffet. Salads were OK. We didn't like the main courses ( mandi and pasta) much. It's not as nice as the Yemeni Cuisine we are used to. Chicken mandi and pasta dishes were smelly. Soup was blant. Their lamb was nice, but rice was cold and not like how the mandi rice should be. Space was very tight. I think it would be better for a  la cart style and not as an open buffet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGV1dGRBEAE,"Unfortunately, my experience at that place was pretty bad. They didn't provide us with the dates to break our fast, and the food selection was limited at the buffet dishes. On top of that, there was no call to prayer made in the restaurant and the prices were way too high!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWN5UWF3EAE,"Amazing chicken Mandi. Terrible service. I would still go there because I love their chicken mandi... but seriously, the number of waitresses and waiters need to increase! Also, it is not child friendly. inside is cold and the high chair is not safe. But again, the food is really delicious: 5star. Service: 1 star"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenBMTW1RRRAB,"I heard positive comments about this restaurant and I prepared myself to have a fantastic night there, but it was anything away from being even good! It was eight of us gathering there to celebrate our new year on a Monday night, at the moment I stepped in I felt I‚Äôm not that welcomed as the waitress looked abit tired that was understandable to me as they were too short-staffed! In fact, I put the blame on the manager who didn‚Äôt hire enough staff and put all the pressure on the poor waitress! The meal was good still I expected it to be more spicy. Last but not least, the worst part was that they forgot to bring our friend‚Äôs meal. When he asked for it (after waiting for too long!!) they were like we ran out of it! Couldn‚Äôt they have given us a notice! Anyway terrible experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOHZEdXpRRRAB,The best Arabic Restaurant in Melbourne

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMFBmS01nEAE,Best Mandi in Melbourne!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ0puaGdBRRAB,"Walked in for a late dinner after reading about this place on 40 under 40$, an article by Dani Valent. It is a cosy and homely restaurant with traditional Yemeni dishes that are packed full of robust flavour and chutzpah. The Adani Tea is fragrant, sweet and refreshing (much like Indian masala chai)! The lamb mandi is slow cooked roasted lamb piled over fragrant and very well cooked basmati rice. Each grain is separate and the unctuous lamb fat and marrow.ooze over the rice, further seasoning it. The lamb itself is fall off the bone tender and the flavour is unbelievable. It is served with tomato water, white sesame sauce and a tomato and cumin heavy broth. It is a perfect sharing size for two; so comforting and satisfying. For dessert we had the kunafah, which is the perfect way to end the meal!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDVHaHh3RRAB,It was such a disappointing experience for us üëéüèª first the lamb was just a small amount and it wasn‚Äôt fresh we got sick after having the lamb mandi üëéüèª and the Areekah soooo small portion as well for $14!! and very dry!! Arabs generally known to be generous üëåüèªI‚Äôm Yemeni so I know the Yemeni food very well and I‚Äôm an old customer I used to order from them when they used to cook from home but the quality of the food has changed and the portions getting smaller and prices went up! and the service was bad we ordered Adani tea after dinner the girl forgot to bring it and it wasn‚Äôt busy we were the only 2 customers in there when I reminded her to bring the tea she said sorry my colleague turned the machine off! as I know the Adani tea makes in a pot! I would never go back!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNi1ELVdnEAE,"Food is great, but customer service could use some work, been there a few times and never seen them smile once, definitely need friendlier staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3Q3cldBEAE,Great Yemeni food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobGR2VlNREAE,I wish I could have tried the food on the 2-3 tables that were available. I found out I had to book ahead of time. Even when coming at 9 pm I was told a table would be free at 10. Take away wasn't even offered. Not good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobUp5RVp3EAE,"This is possibly the tastiest, most delicious food I have ever had eating out. Authentic Yemeni cuisine with all the aroma and spiciness you could wish for. Incredibly generous portions and everything cooked to perfection. Quick friendly service and the ambience dining in is an experience in itself."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNklLNnpnRRAB,Food is so tasty and spectacular ..brings me back to the time when i used to live in the middle east..they have majilis as well for a big family..my family and i enjoyed the delicious food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM0lpQmxnRRAB,Called them multiple times to order before picking it up but no one responded on the given number. Drove to the restaurant since Google shows they are supposed to be open from 9am to 1am. Reached around 12:15pm and found it closed with no signage or operating hours notices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCek4zcEpnEAE,This place is quite nice and the chickens are tender . Rice is very flavourful and had good dining experience overall.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck1LdjRRRRAB,SOOOO GOOD!!!! prices very reasonable and the best mexican food i‚Äôve had outside of mexico! will definitely be on my regular restaurant rotation

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4akx5UmtBRRAB,"Tasty Mex food. We were sited right at the door and the staff had the door open all the time. Combined with Melbourne chilly weather, not the best experience overall..."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTRyWXFBRRAB,"The chicken wings were alarmingly wet, I hope they didn't go for a swim beforehand LOL."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHYyQlVREAE,"Generous serving sizes, delicious flavours and very friendly, helpful staff. Authentic Mexican dishes. We hadn't made a booking for a Monday night but the staff were able to accommodate our small family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXFIeDVnRRAB,Jalapeno bites are gross - they're laid in a slobber of mayonnaise and old rocket. Filled with gross cream cheese and served cold. Blurghhhh!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnBXa0x3EAE,Always a great meal here.  The fries are exceptional...and everything is fab too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczhDdlZREAE,Great Margies. The bartender even did a special off menu jug upon request. Will definitely be back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGFEWUdBEAE,"Incredible food, great pricing and a huge menu. Service let it down slightly (but staff were friendly!) and they didn‚Äôt have our booking in the system but made a space for us quickly ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeFlUWU9BEAE,V good food and service especially try the Quesadilla
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeVp1d2ZREAE,"Good food however overshadowed by extremely poor customer service and professionalism. Waited over 55 minutes for two tacos whilst the rest of our table finished their dinner and had their plates cleared. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2NfeVlBEAE,Food looks okay but not even remotely authentic. Prices are ridiculous and there‚Äôs always really terrible music playing far too loudly when walking by - won‚Äôt ever be eating here!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnBQcmZ3EAE,"I attended a group dinner at this restaurant, prior to this, had heard positive feedback re the service and food. I personally liked the friendly and prompt staff, amazing service delivered with a smile on the face. Needless to say, food is amazing too. I lost my earring during that event, considering it's a small item and difficult to look for the next day, i still called pruthvi (owner) and let him know. He, along with his staff diligently looked for it and they found it. Kudos to you guys! Keep up the great job you doing !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN29EVEx3EAE,Great service Food is delicious Drinks are great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGVHd0pREAE,"Food looks good, place is clean, food has no mexican flavour"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHRQNmJnEAE,"If you‚Äôre looking for delicious modern Mexican food with a twist, this is your place! üåÆ  Known for their incredible Daily Deals you MUST check out, including: üç∏ Monday Margaritas ($12 Margaritas every Monday from 5pm) üåÆ Taco Tuesday ($5 Tacos every Tuesday from 5pm) üçó Wing Wednesday ($1 Wings every Wednesday from 5pm) üçπ Thirsty Thursday (Buy 1 Cocktail and get 1 Free every Thursday from 5pm) üçπ Sangria Sunday ($25 Sangria jugs every Sunday from 5pm) + Bottomless Brunch for $69pp! ‚òÄÔ∏è  Highly recommend their Seafood Platter ($70 for 2ppl) which includes Fried Calamari, Char Grilled Corn, Crisps & Dips, Fried Fish Burrito, Chilli Grilled Prawn Tacos & Battered Onion Rings üôå  The tacos are a MUST TRY here üåÆ their Fried Fish Taco ($8) is seriously one of the best I‚Äôve had and the Chilli Lime Mushroom Taco ($7.5) is packed with flavour!  They have stores in Carlton, St Kilda, Hawthorn and Hampton!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURock1EOE9nEAE,Food is tasty and variety is great. Weekly specials are good value and service is good. Sometimes the taco shells and buns they use are stale however.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodU1hUV9RRRAB,A great place for friends for a celebration. The atmosphere is electric and the service is wonderful. The food though can be hit or miss. It's not as vibrant or fresh as I've had in other Mexican places. Especially the pulled beef or pork just is a little salty or just not that very rich or fresh.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTl2NVRREAE,Excellent mexikan Food. Even my Mexican husband approved and I will tell you that means a lot because he is picky and and makes excellent Mexican food himself.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodll2ekpREAE,"Gorgeous bright little restaurant  set in the heart of Carlton with delicious tastes of Mexico. The hot cauliflower wings & corn  (pictured) were delicious! The cauliflower could do with a little more spice though considering they're meant to be spicy. Still, totally yum! My friends had the burrito bowls which they loved. The chips were very yummy too. The staff is lovely, very quiet but opened up a little the more we engaged them. Great value for money too. We will definitely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEttdDZBRRAB,"Went for a 30th to the upstairs function room, great lighting and outdoor balcony area! Staff were very friendly and hosted with a smile the whole night even for a rowdy bunch! Thank you"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b0lHWk9REAE,"Friendly service, food and wine were wonderful and were prepared in good time! Couldn't have had a better experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDZYNS13RRAB,The prawn pizza and the lasagna great!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjhPMmV3EAE,Outstanding pizza & pasta. Made with love as they say. Delicious. Thankyou
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDhmNFFnEAE,Chicken parm was very underwhelming. Expensive for what you receive.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcC1DYVh3EAE,"Lovely place with good food, nice staff and really moderate prices!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWFmR2VnEAE,The waiters were very nice. Particularly to the kids! Food was excellent!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWRqdXBBRRAB,The staff are awful. Very very rude.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGV1eWtRRRAB,A seafood risotto with chorizo and calamari was on the specials board. Chuck in a nice Jim Barry shiraz . $40 all up. Very enjoyable lunch. Couldn't believe the parking opportunities just around the corner in Pelham St.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXBMQnZnRRAB,Really enjoyed our meal and great service. Wide selection of dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeFBxbUlBEAE,Good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeVB5Ymx3RRAB,Fantastic food and the option for Livenpay was also great! Their Princess pasta was one of the best pastas sauces I‚Äôve had
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUsyd2NnEAE,"The food was average, the 'main' sized pasta was tiny. Garlic bread was soggy and underdone, and one serving was forgotten. But the worst part was how unprofessional the staff were. There was 5 girls standing around behind the bar laughing, hugging, fixing their hair, watching videos on their phones and one of them was licking a spoon. No regard for the fact that the bar is in full view of customers, or that there was tables waiting to order. This restaurant really needs to consider hiring staff with more customer service experience, as it looked like the whole place was run by teenagers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0x6UHV3RRAB,Awesome meal and great service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMy1ldU1nEAE,told more than an hour after we ordered that it was in the oven after we asked
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSei1DT1lnEAE,"Parking extremely difficult; excellent food-good portions, well priced, a little slow on the service, but very responsive when requested."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTl1eXFRRRAB,Terrific function area upstairs!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDlHT21BRRAB,A very tasty pasta marinara that was buttery and delicious. Full of seafood and a gentle heat of chilli üå∂ üòã They were quick to correct the dish after the order was misunderstood. A great night
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWFEa1dnEAE,"Dined here on a Monday night on the way to the Comedy festival. We walked in without a booking and the place was almost full, however they managed to fit us in. The host was lovely and we enjoyed lasagne and a Mexican Pizza-both excellent. Efficient service and well priced. The place has a lovely atmosphere and is such an icon in the vicinity. Truly good Italian food. Will visit again.  Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmJxdWR3EAE,"Quick friendly service, food came out really quickly and tasted great"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGY2Mzd3RRAB,"Great selection of food, staff service was alright"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2Z6QjFRRRAB,"Nice place to visit on Lygon street, had the veal schnitzel which was pretty decent"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXBDTjFBRRAB,Great food and atmosphere with heating outside
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXBmVkhREAE,Poor service - couldn't get another chair on our table just because it'll block the other table when there was clearly no other customers at the restaurant at that time  Food was a bit disappointing
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk12NklREAE,Best Authentic Italian restaurant in Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NE1pUTB3RRAB,"Perfection. Quality of service was best we‚Äôve experienced in years of dining. Atmosphere, decor, vibe, and of course, the food. Absolutely exceptional. Among the best Italian we‚Äôve ever had. Pasta was divine, entrees were beautiful and desserts were delectable. The service is worth another mention. We felt so beautifully looked after. Cant recommend enough. Thank you Guido chefs and front of house team!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjc2UDNnRRAB,"Great food and wine, ambience and the wait staff are top level. Went with family tonight. From start to finish, the service and food was amazing and it topped off my visiting family's holiday on their last night. If anyone is looking for an authentic Italian restaurant, then this is the place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLV8yZHNRRRAB,"Beautiful setting, wonderful service and great food - can highly recommend the Spaghetti con le Cozze and the Agnolotti al Nero di Seppia. We had a cheeseboard and desserts to round out the night with a recommended paired dessert wine.  Will definitely be going back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmNEQ2Z3EAE,"One of the best place for Italian food, handmade pasta with authentic Italian flavors , gorgeous! to die for dessert. If this is my last meal on earth, I can die a happy person. The service is amazing, the wine list is well ranged (ask for Italian wine recommendations) I will definitely visit again . Highly highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbFplZGFBEAE,Delicious food and amazing friendly service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnNmZzZBRRAB,"delicious! The several pastas I ordered are very good, especially the tomato macaroni is delicious, and the service attitude is very good. The black coffee poured on the tiramisu neutralizes the bitterness, and the taste is very good~"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXFUcG9nRRAB,Wanted to eat here but the waitresses totally ignored me and my partner after making eye contact multiple times. Who knew preparing a table was a 2 man job
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMVBPMEN3EAE,"We went to Da Guido as a family last night and 'wow'.  It's a beautiful italian restaurant at the city end of Lygon St and the food and staff were amazing.  2 great pasta dishes, a caprese salad which took us back to the local markets of Italy and a risotto, not on the menu, and made just for me by the chef.  Customer service like this is a rarity in this post-covid world where often hospitality staff appear to either 'not care' or appear 'arrogant' and at Da Guido, Mirko and his team really care.  I definitely recommend you go here and experience great food and great service in a lovely setting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk4yRC1BRRAB,"Great food and wines, helpful staff and cosy environment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc0o2bm53RRAB,"Food was good for the price, portions were on the small side and charging for cold bread and charging separately for a small dish of oil or butter strikes me as pretty stingy. Is it normal for higher end restaraunts to charge for bread?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMTl2TkNBEAE,Amazing food. Great service. Will definitely going back there when I'm in Melbourne next.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjl1V1l3EAE,"Overall, it‚Äôs pretty good. The pasta and ravioli are both delicious, but the price is a little bit expensive. The decoration style is suitable for more formal dining, suitable for couples dating."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1phLWl3RRAB,"Excellent food, wine and attentive service. Wonderful wine advice too. Our group enjoyed every minute and every bite at Da Guido La Pasta. Italian pasta at its best."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa1lQejFnRRAB,Nice place with great food and service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3Z6UEx3EAE,"Great place, friendly staff. Food great, just wanted more üòâüôÇ Very helpful when I asked for a particular recipe üôÇ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM29qb1RnEAE,"Fantastic experience, Wonderful seafood flavours through the pastas. Would come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSanNfeHlBRRAB,"A wonderful surprise.  Great service, great food and a really stylish restaurant.  Can‚Äôt wait to go back and try another of their meals."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocThfa0xREAE,Went there with some friends. The pasta was delicious. Very friendly and welcoming service.  We had 3 different kind of pasta and just shared everything. The fagottini filled with spinach were our favorites!  I definitely will go back and try the other dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEtyQm13RRAB,"We had a lovely dinner here tonight for my husband‚Äôs 40th birthday. We sat in the corner by the window and even with a full house, we could still hear each other and the music. The food was bloody delicious - had the Wagyu ravioli, Spag cozze and gnocci. So so good! Highly recommend for homemade pasta with authentic flavours. Service was top notch too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOTd5RmtnRRAB,"We rocked in late and were greeted with wonderful, friendly and professional service, delicious food (bruschetta, pasta and dessert), and didn't feel hurried in the slightest despite being the last table left. Decor is delightful, too. I'll be bringing my mum here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeC1ua2dRRRAB,"Super relaxed and authentic atmosphere with the nicest service ever, thanks to all of you guys! We had a beautiful first night in Melbourne, so happy we found this gem. Oh yeah, sorry, the food? Was just perfect ‚ô•Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTV6UUhBEAE,"Mirco‚Äôs service tonight was amazing, we loved each main that came out from the kitchen, wouldn‚Äôt want to spend my birthday any other way. Thank you to the team who made the night memorable, and the chefs who executed the perfect birthday dinner."
