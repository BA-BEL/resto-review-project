ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N0xLYzJBRRAB,"Awesome place for dinner, the steak and sides were amazing. Been to the one in Auckland and the Melbourne one definitely didn't disappoint, I'll be back again very soon üòç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4a1BLaGNnEAE,"Extremely disappointed. The door handles were cute and put a smile on our faces, but it all went down hill from there.  Asian lady gave us a cold reception and looked down at us when we arrived.  Waited for her to *check*  if there was a table available.  When she returned, she took us upstairs and it took a while before we got any service. The maitre d' was nervous and fumbled his words and lacked confidence. We were *entertained* by staff who would be discussing things that perhaps should not be audible to customers.  Not to mention staff who were talking across the room! Appalling! And the constant walking aimlessly of staff.  Back and forth.  What is that all about?  And they multiply!  We were served by so many different people it was a joke. Perhaps it‚Äôs no wonder staff walk around like headless chooks.  No-one knows what‚Äôs going on!  The food, not worth the hefty price tag!  Way over priced.  Would certainly have expected more for our money. Mixologist needs to learn basic bar skills. Add the ice first, not after to avoid getting a dirty glass from the splashing, especially when it‚Äôs a drink like Baileys.  Not coming back.  Better places to go to get fine dining."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NFA2d2hnRRAB,I ordered the wagyu tomahawk. It was cooked to perfection. The service was also pretty good. Overall I would come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzdLNFRnEAE,"Dined in with my Family to celebrate our birthdays. Service was great, staff were lovely and gave honest recommendations about the menu and the specials, however ordering proved difficult. We had a new staff member who was doing her best however we all order a different 'type' of meat with different cooked preferences. (Some rare, medium-rare, well-done etc) When we recieved our meals the preference of cooked was all jumbled up, So the 300g  Sorloin that was suppose to be rare came well-done, the sauces ordered with the meat were missing or also jumbled up. I hope this was a one time mix up but for the price you're paying for a few grams of meat at a Butchery, I was hoping for the best meal possible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScl9lMjFBRRAB,"Went here with high hopes, the concierge was great but after that the service was mediocre at best. Our waitress was terrible, which was highly disappointing when we we‚Äôre spending close to $500 for two people. Our entree‚Äôs were ok, and steaks weren‚Äôt cooked to perfection as expected from the price tag. We were offered dessert, but on the condition that we had it ordered and eaten in 10 minutes as they wanted they table back, which we were not told at the beginning. Every table around us who had been seated before us, were still sitting and eating there food. Then I paid the bill in cash and she had the audacity to ask me if I wanted my change.  Overall, poor service & average food for the price tag, we won‚Äôt be coming back in a hurry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWV6VmZ3EAE,"We booked for 12pm lunch, in which we arrived to be the only ones in the section of the restaurant. The music was really loud vocals, in which my friend and I had to raise voices to hear each other. We asked if the music could be turned down. They reduced is down only slightly. We asked again saying we were finding it hard to chat or consider the menu. The manager who didn‚Äôt even bother to come down from the upper floor to check, said rudely that she wouldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not just for us but for others too - which at that point was no one. When we got up to leave saying that obviously we were not willing to stay because of her rudeness towards the handling of the situation, she tried to back track. Other staff tried to de-escalate, while the manager tried defending herself. We then went to Cumulus Inc where the ambient music and service was excellent. The prices on the Botswana Butchery wine list were easily 3-4 times what you can buy at wine stores as well. Will definitely not be recommending."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSalpENURnEAE,"Was excited to come here, but it was a massive let down. Food was ok, wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible. Prices didn't match. Huuuge let down with cocktails, they were mediocre and tired, and very under whelming. They also need to get some cocktail glasses, as we were served different cocktails all in wine glasses, not acceptable for a place that charges so much, only our espresso martini was in a coupe glass. Service wasn't bad, but not good either, something i expect from a Cafe not a place where I just spent $100 on steak. Finished our courses and sat there for a good 15mins before our plates were cleared. About 6 empty glasses on our table and wasn't cleared, except when a girl came over to pick up the espresso martini glass, but didn't pick up anything else Overall, very overpriced and underwhelming."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWFiVldREAE,"Very nice steak house and one that lives up to the hype. We came here for one thing and one thing only, and that is the steak. I found it really good to see that the selection is from all around Australia and the cuts were of a very good quality. Kudos to the chef for cooking medium rare perfectly. The service was all round very good and venue had a nice feel to it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd2Z1QmhnRRAB,Great food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenZ1QnZBRRAB,"Everything was amazing, especially the food. Had the 1.6kgs lamb shoulder for 2. Only negative was, it took 23 mins for a waiter to come and ask us for our drink order from when we first sat down. And when we said no to the dessert, they just brought us the bill even though we were still having our drinks. Other than those 2 negatives, everything else was perfect."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXNLbXBnRRAB,"We had the lobster and bottomless fries offer...only there was no bottomless fries. Don't get me wrong,  the portions were decent,  but there was no talk of more fries when the plates were clean. In fact, service was not great. We were seated immediately,  and received our drinks and food in good time, but then completely ignored. Our bottle of wine was placed on a bench opposite our table,  despite plenty of room on our table,  and yet no one returned to fill our drinks. The mark up on their wines is also triple"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXVqVTB3RRAB,Excellent food and very nice atmosphere
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMU1DVUtnEAE,"Just a ridiculous amount of fake reviews by the owner.  Hmm..150+ 5 star reviews in the last few weeks, all of them being the first review written by the person, or the reviewer has given every restaurant in the group 5 stars.  It's so fake they even mistakenly posted a 5 star review for one of the other restaurants in the company's group (Wong Baby) on the Botswana Butchery listing. Just so lame.  BTW, I've ACTUALLY been here, and it's way over-priced and is devoid of any cool vibe or atmosphere.  Oh, and read the small print on the menu.  ""Service charge of 10% on groups of 8 or more. 15% surcharge on Public Holidays. 10% surcharge on Sundays."""
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk5ma193RRAB,"Brilliant waitier and bar staff, Kiah, Kai and Ellie we especially attentive and fed me cake, cannot complain really. 5star!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVBEcDRRRRAB,Deal advertised on the website was not honoured when we got there. Very disappointed and ended up paying much more for our lunch than we expected.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc1BlYjFnRRAB,"With so many great places to choose from in Melbourne, why come here? The service is indifferent, the food is just ok. If you‚Äôre going to spend $300+ on a meal, do yourself a favour and go to Hazel, Gimlet, Meatmaiden, Bar Margaux, Phillipe, Grill Americano, Pearl Diver, Fable‚Ä¶."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEtxNDJ3RRAB,"Tried their lobster and bottomless fries special and it was well-cooked and good value. 5-star for the food, but dropped 1 star because the matcha cocktail tasted like just milk and sugar‚Ä¶ missing green tea flavour and alcohol! The service was also very average. It seems like they are understaffed and because we sat out at the front instead of the main restaurant space, we were mostly forgotten."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEtLTzJBRRAB,"First time at Botswana Butchery. Lovely place, although it‚Äôs interior design feels a tad dated. Good service, and lovely food. I wasn‚Äôt blown away by the steak I ordered, nonetheless it was very tasty and all the sides were excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb09QZ1V3EAE,Rose chaja is surprisingly good :) My steak is on the rare side though even when I ordered medium.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd05mM2dRRRAB,"We came here off the back of the half lobster and bottomless fries special as per the article on Concrete Playground. We made a lunch booking only to find out that apparently you have to request the lobster specials at the time of the booking. No where in the article or their website is this stated. I could see a few tables around us were here for the lobster too, unfortunately they looked just as disappointed as we were.  So we ordered off the √† la carte lunch menu. The food was decent but at those prices you would expect something that exceeds expectations. Unfortunately this did not. We ended up getting the burger, snapper, veal cutlet, and some sides, which were fine but nothing to expound about. The potato salad came in a tiny bowl, unmixed. So you have to mix it yourself all the while trying not to spill it. The waitress dumped the mac and cheese on the table, very close to my sister's arm whilst she was trying to cut her burger, nearly burning her arm with the hot cast iron bowl it came in. At one point the music was blasted up so loud it was all you could hear, before it was turned back down.  Furthermore, the dishes took quite some time to come out that we, and especially the kids, grew restless. Between the noisy clanging of bar staff dropping stuff and the kitchen staff dropping stuff, by the end we just wanted to leave.  At these prices, I would not recommend. The service and the food should at least be above average to warrant such prices but it was just a very average, and disappointing, experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbl96RGlRRRAB,"Deals advertised were not honoured at the restaurant, staff were rude and inattentive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjd5TEV3EAE,"Specials / deals on Instagram and their website are not honoured, even when you book online"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDd5c3d3RRAB,"I came here after hearing about it from a few of my friends.  In general, the food was great. My steak; however, was a little dry when it came out, not reflected by others at the table.  The service did feel a little rushed to me. Mains came out about 5 minutes after starters. Desert, much the same.  The food and wine selection is enormous. French onion soup was pretty good. The onion rings were average. Salad and greens were fantastic.  In all. I would recommend it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMi16MnpBRRAB,"So happy to celebrate the 2023 F1 Grand Prix here. We visited when Botswana was offering a Pit Stop Lunch with St hugo wines. Pit Stop lunch was $95pp and included choice of entr√©e and main, finished off with a petit four and  Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon pairing. We had the Kingfish and permisson for entree, salmon and steak for mains and passionfruit dessert. Was such an amazing experience.  Service was very good and staff were very friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbV9uVkFREAE,My partner and two of his coworkers got extreme food poisoning after eating lobster here. I am physically scarred from witnessing the extent of this food poisoning. STRONGLY do not recommend this place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNi1XZjJRRRAB,"Attended with a party of four; three of us suffered food poisoning from the Lobster.  We could see the Lobster pre-cooked and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen.  The service was very poor, and the follow up customer service once we reported the incident was also very poor."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZMjd1ZENBEAE,"2023: Very disappointed with Pope Joan recently.  So expensive, such small portion and it‚Äôs not even tasty.  I had this The Cornish: Milawa roast chicken, stuffing, mayo, jalape√±os, tarragon, lettuce and the chicken looks and tastes like some stodgey paste.  For $23 I expected so much better.  I felt so disappointed that I bought friends here, recommending them because I thought it would be nice to dine in.  I might as well go to the food court.  No matter what grade chicken they use, it was still a disappointing lunch.  2020 3.5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è Ever since Pope Joan has closed down in Brunswick I often lament that I have never tried them.  So when they put a signage up near Sofitel I had to knock on their door and asked ‚Äú Is this THE pope Joan?!‚Äù Turns out it was!  Took my girlfriend to lunch there the other day and we had a whipped cheese w kohlrabi and a mixed platter of salad.  I was a bit unsure about the whipped cheese dish.  It had a weird taste to it which I wasn‚Äôt sure whether it‚Äôs the parsley oil with the dehydrated parsley on top, or whether there was something else which tasted a bit licorice / cuminey which I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of.  The mixed salad was fabulous.  We had a miso pumpkin w seaweed (note to self replicate that!), a cauliflower salad, a modern take to Caesar which is one large cos leaf w one fish sitting on a bed of creamed egg.  Everything tasted nice but not sure whether it‚Äôs worth $24 for this.  Maybe it‚Äôs the location, maybe it‚Äôs the name, maybe it‚Äôs both but I just found the price is a bit steep for the portion you got, but the quality is fantastic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWV2alBnEAE,Great location and relaxing outdoor terrace dining at the top of Collins St. Reuben sandwich must be one of the best in Melbourne Quality ingredients and condiments which go very well with fries. Service is attentive. The breakfast menu is worth a try as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUxpTWZREAE,"Went to Pope Joan for the first time living almost next door in Spring Street. What was potentially a good experience was WRECKED by their ""penny-pinching"" attitude! Ordered a salad that was rather wet with juices and dressing and subsequently asked for ""a piece of bread"" in order to soak-up the remaining liquid on my plate. Two requests and 10 minutes later 2 pieces of bland toast were supplied with a $10 charge - what a rip off and a sad and mean way to treat customers. Whatever happened to the concept of hospitality and leaving customers feeling pleased with the experience and valued as a customer? Shame on you! You deceived $10 out of me but how short-sighted of you as you won't be receiving anymore of my money NOR any of my friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2ZEcC1nRRAB,For when you can‚Äôt get into the European for breakfast. Rice pudding is üëå ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScVlpM2RREAE,"Lovely atmosphere. Coffee Lovely, just a little low tide cup fullness wise. Love m6 coffee and relish every last drop so a full cup is important to me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXZtckxREAE,"Gorgeous setting, delicious food and impeccable service. The kitchen staff even cut up my dish so i could eat it with one hand due to being injured. Very sweet!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodUthb1F3EAE,Nice vibe nice coffee
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocU1DRU5REAE,"Great, would recommend the chilli scrambled eggs! Good service too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaU8zNEFnEAE,"If you like your coffee burnt with no teaspoon, no sugar & no napkin , indifferent & lazy service & soggy scrambled eggs sprayed with house cleaner then it's a right place for you. Absolutely the worst cafe in the city of Melbourne!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaVo3TlpBEAE,Great coffee. I enjoyed the comfortable outdoor table. I had the egg and bacon breakfast roll and was very satisfied with it. Could not ask for better. Good service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocXJTNEt3EAE,Coffee machine is turned off at approx 3:45 daily so if you‚Äôre looking for a coffee here don‚Äôt bother after 4pm
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcWZxNkN3EAE,Sandwiches made to perfection.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtenFuVGlnRRAB,The food portions for breakfast  were extremely small for the price. A spoonful of rice pudding ? #shrinkflation
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHRYbUJnEAE,Undoubtedly best long black coffee in Melbourne with service overseen by Leah. Try the Friday Champagne Gosset special  - a delightful way to end the working week.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteXJpTlJnEAE,"Cute spot with lots of action and people to watch. Thought the menu was a bit limited, but that‚Äôs probably more to do with the busy lunch crowd rather than encouraging people to linger."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlN19xVktBEAE,Nice place for a morning coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbnJqYjBBRRAB,Pine mushroom spring roll - great. The ‚ÄúCornish‚Äù  - $24 for a mini chicken roll with rocket - uh.  Nice setting with good service does not excuse the exorbitant price!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NXZhMm1RRRAB,Lovely service and delicious food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa0xfQ0x3EAE,"Had a delicious brekky here, very chic, great coffee. Hidden in the valet parking courtyard of The Sofitel Hotel, indoor & outdoor dining. Open lunch and dinner, not open weekends during the day, so check times."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOHNEb0pnEAE,"Excellent first time experience, meal and friendly attentive staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodktuUHBRRRAB,"Waited 15 minutes for a 1/8 of a schnitzel and small chips, only customer waiting. Bloody rip off."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLVpLYXRRRRAB,Wrap missing 2 out of 6 ingredients. Very small portion. Staff were unhappy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeWZuYkNREAE,AMAZING
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOUl1R3RnRRAB,Really quick.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZzR2Wm5RRRAB,"I placed a fairly large catering order with Shnitz Collins Place and Marie went above and beyond to ensure that my corporate lunch went well. She was extremely communicative, and handled any obstacles or issues with a great attitude. Really appreciated her efforts in getting my order fulfilled. Compliments to her and the team. Would recommend for any large group orders."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeHFUMTZnRRAB,25mins for a wrap‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeVBubEZBEAE,"Service was quick, food great and price very reasonable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeV9iRmxBRRAB,Food delivery
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGF2VXp3RRAB,Can never go wrong with Schnitz for a work lunch. Queues can get quite long from 12.15 onwards but they are able to cope with the volume.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcUpQT3FRRRAB,Friendly staff tasty food reasonable prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNjlMMk5BEAE,Waited nearly 15 minutes for cold chips and a very sloppy wrap. In fairness they looked like they were training. $21 for reg cold chips and a wrap that needed a knife and fork and a solo drink is a bit rich though. Had better here in the past
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbnRxWWVBEAE,"Ordered the chicken parmigiana, large chips and a roll. The oil used to cook these items was rancid/very stale. It was so disgusting i had to throw away the entire meaL."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OF9xNzJBRRAB,"This place has such a rude staff. My partner was given wrong items in her order, something that she didn‚Äôt order and doesn‚Äôt eat as well. When she pointed out she got a wrong one, she was told if she wants it changed she has to buy it and pay for it. Staff might have not heard it properly when my partner was ordering, that can happen, acceptable. But sending her back and asking to pay for new one is not expected behaviour from Schnitz, and definitely not part of food industry culture in this country. She didn‚Äôt have her card and was carrying limited cash, so she had just throw the food and walk off."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcVlLTXJBRRAB,I love that they do beef now! Beef was cooked beautifully and quickly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNXBld3BnRRAB,"After I played a show in Melbourne, me and my crew were returning back to our hotel room when we noticed that Schnitz was open. The staff were awesome and cooked up a mad feed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNXFmVUx3EAE,"I enjoy coming to this place regularly after shopping on Collins St. The chicken is golden and tasty, chips are beautiful and go well with dip. They have a really good selection of drinks available, service is fast and they have good music playing.  I love that the staff are helpful and joyful, really puts a smile on my face."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNXJ2a2t3RRAB,"Beautiful quality of chicken, amazing staff and amazing chips. I give it two thumbs up"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNmFLeW1nRRAB,YUMMYYYYY
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMUtqa3NnRRAB,Delicious pan fried dishes - with very tasty chips.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNOGRDTFp3EAE,"One of the better schnitz places I've been to, great for food on the move. The staff are always eager to help and offer great service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dVBDYXBBRRAB,fried chicken to goated üò§üôè‚ö†Ô∏è
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3FUS2N3EAE,"When I gave the menu to a Korean woman, I threw the menu and went, but it was very unpleasant. Not only that, but I tried to order the menu step by step, but I didn't order a lot of menus. ‚ÄúDo you only order this? ‚Äù, which sounded really bad. I went for a drink in a good mood, but I was offended and left right away.  They throw there menu list on the table and they had the worst service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWY2SmNBEAE,I liked the atmosphere but the food was OK. I liked the spicy pork. But the rest of the food was just OK. The plain rice was a bit undercooked and didn't taste too well. Even Uncle Rogers would have cried if he saw a Korean restaurant fail in cooking simple rice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXFfd1d3EAE,"Sorry, great service but food was a miss for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnFlS0Z3EAE,"The most delicious kimchi fried rice I've ever had in my life. The rice was not stir-fried properly, so it clumped together, but it only tasted like butter or margarine mixed with white rice. I mixed only this kimchi, butter, and rice and added an egg. I ordered it to be unsatisfied, but some kind of roasted pig's feet came, not a dissatisfaction It's food that I'll never make again and never eat again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXVpc2pRRRAB,"How come I found Sichuan peppercorn, star anise and  Sichuan chilli bean paste in my pork leg pot? Did I have Korean food or Chinese dishes last nightü§î. By the way, they should improve their hygiene because i rushed to the toilet after having their food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXRTT2RnEAE,long waiting time and worse service ever„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeUxMYlV3EAE,ORDER THE FRIED CHICKEN WITH BONES!!! You won‚Äôt regret!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1lhcHN3RRAB,Really good Korean restaurant with extremely decent prices. Portions are huge and taste is unique.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdHRLSGhRRRAB,Garlic jokbal restaurant üê∑ You must be try garlic jokbal !!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbXRpcC13RRAB,"I ate half and half bossam a while ago. I was eating radish and something caught on it, so when I took it out, there was a string inside. I want to upload a picture but I don't know how to upload it ;; You need to take care of your hygiene."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ3ZyeTdnRRAB,The meat was pretty dried. It used to be one of my favourite place but no more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScExLZkR3EAE,Ordered the bossam + boneless fried chicken. You can't go wrong with bossam at Dosirock!! The food is absolutely great. I would come back again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2RxVmp3RRAB,"I ordered for takeout. They took out the air rice and gave it to me.. I'm so sorry... I couldn't check it because the store tied the packaging bag. Still, I was able to fill my longing for pork feet. Makguksu also feels more abundant than in Korea. I'm complaining because it's broken. I wish it was more spicy. The side dishes were all fresh and delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3A3REJ3EAE,"I ordered cold vegetable pig's trotters and soft tofu with Uber Eat, but cold vegetable pig's feet are not the cold vegetable pig's feet you know, but a mix leaf, a few pieces of pig's feet, buckwheat noodles, and the sauce is not that spicy of mustard sauce, it's not spicy, it's just sweet.. $46.20 The moment I was disappointed because it wasn't worth it at all, the moment I saw the soft tofu stew, I was again disappointed that the soft tofu was really a soup like the name on the menu. Just frozen seafood cocktail shrimp frozen clams in plain water The total payment of 69$, which was not well-resolved, was so disappointing that I was put on the list of things I would not order."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocWUybDZnRRAB,"I usually order fried chicken and Kimji soup. They are very tasty. I also tried the fish roe soup , the best I can find in Melbourne.  Recommended !!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3RIRXl3RRAB,Good food Unique menu - pork hock than elsewhere don‚Äôt have Their cold noodle also exceptionally good Reasonable price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobG8zR2ZREAE,"ÏïåÌÉï was very good, but the Ï°±Î∞ú (pork hoc) we ordered was served cold. We never experienced a pork hoc served cold, as it is supposed to be served hot. Atmosphere was nice and good staff :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocE9YT2tBRRAB,"Was recommended to try the pork hock, and it was delish! We had a serve of pork hock, soba salad, and a large soup, and it was definitely more than enough for 3 of us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocE1MMjRnRRAB,Moderately priced  authentic Korean. The nengmyon is fantastic. I'm gonna bring my friends here to try more dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaEwzc0VBEAE,The pork belly and hock is one of their most well known dishes and it‚Äôs reputation is definitely well deserved. One of the great Korean food places that opens late as a bonus!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbWZxM3lBRRAB,"As a tourist who has been to Seoul before, I think this place is really amazing. The Pork tastes amazing and I love the vibe here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcG9EUzJnRRAB,The hotpot price nowadays is just too expensive with the serving size however the taste was great without a doubt
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaks3a3JnRRAB,"We randomly picked Dosirock after getting slightly overwhelmed by the Korean food options in the neighborhood. Their specialties, jokbal (pig's trotters) and bossam (pork belly), did not disappoint as they were perfectly cooked and generously portioned! As four people, we could barely finish a medium-sized half and half. There are other non-pork options available. Kudos to their prompt service and friendly staff too"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUoydlN3EAE,"The food is deliscious, we try the chicken corndue or forndue ( not sure the exact name) it was awesome! And the hotteok was so gummy and yummy!üòã worth the money. It will just take time for your order to come as only few staff i guess is cooking.  Will definitely come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cUtpbnV3RRAB,Great Experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b1BPN0tBEAE,"Definitely try the soy garlic chicken, so yum!!! But the waiting line is quite troublesome"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa00td193RRAB,very delicious food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoemFHV3l3RRAB,Great service and food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod0tQWTFnRRAB,"The fried chicken was not good. The chicken had no flavour except for old oil. It was also extremely oily. The sweet mustard sauce was good, as was the corn cheese. Very disappointing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcmVIRVVnEAE,"Finally made it to the restaurant as we have only ordered fried chicken in the past which was always spot on. üí•üí•üí•üí•üí• I was a bit surprised how long it took for our food to arrive, especially the place wasn‚Äôt full (a lot of delivery orders tho) We ordered:  Chicken Corndue üí•üí• arrived after 37min Cheese tasted a little flat and the fact that the cheese arrived 5min later than the chicken, didn‚Äôt make it better as the chicken wings were cold then. Also, I wish they would serve a couple of chicken tenders instead of a few chicken wings.  Japchae mandu üí•üí•üí•üí• very crispy and nicely flavoured outside but the filling tasted blunt. Arrived after 45 min.  Crispy chicken burger üí•üí•üí•üí•üí• my personal highlight but took almost an hour to get served. Loved the fact that the chicken was super hot and crispy and the coleslaw came fresh out of the fridge.  Service could have been a little more attentive but was for kind and helpful. Four stars only because I know their boneless chicken is one the best‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMUxLbnJRRRAB,The best chickeeeen!!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOVlEVEdnEAE,Delicous korean chicken place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGJUR2pBRRAB,We had a party of 5 on a Saturday night and staff were able to provide us with a small table without a prior booking.  Food was well made and arrived at the table in good intervals.  Staff were friendly and accommodating.  Please excuse the half eaten dinner üòÖ forgot to take a before photo.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN0lqTC1nRRAB,"This place used to be very good but it has clearly gone down the hill and today‚Äôs meal was a complete disappointment! The potato haven was undercooked, tasted terrible and had some tomato sauce all over it! The chicken was also very average so we won‚Äôt be returning‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtakxlVHdRRRAB,Best for dine in and take always. So good chickenü•∞ü•∞ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcDRyVFJBEAE,Great burger!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcGRMRGFnEAE,Staff were lovely. The soy/garlic chicken was top of our list after trying it last time in Melbourne and mozzarella sticks topped it off nicely.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdDdhRDhRRRAB,Great food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROThHZld3EAE,Good service and fantastic food hidden in the alleyway Strongly recommend the steaks and ribs on the menu.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbW9uTGpBRRAB,"Good steak, wine is too expensive"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMlBESnZnRRAB,"Good service, ribs and sauces. Very simple menu but no much can go wrong. Beef ribs are a must."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMTZ2c0RBEAE,The cuts of steak are nice and tasty. But you can't say when a clearly very rare steak (that is meant to be medium rare) is requested to be cooked as you asked 'our medium rare is a little under what others are'. That's just not how steak is done. Steak should be cooked the way steak is cooked. There is a standard
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOXRISFNBEAE,"Perfect day, great company,  amazing food, brilliant service Jenny Lauren"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4dklqOHFBRRAB,"Worth dining in this restaurant. Totally satisfying peaceful environment. We had made prior bookings for a table as essondon was full at the time we wanted. Staff was very friendly & attentive. We had ordered salmon which was very soft and juicy, porterhouse, beef burger. All tasted amazing and delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjdHVyV0dBEAE,Live coming here for steak n chips with there mushroom sauce. Been back many times since
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeXBfa2hBRRAB,"Staff friendly, food and price are all good!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN2RiYkZBEAE,"I used to work here as a Head Chef around 2006 to 2007, man they have the best a graded mouth watering cut of meat  and slow poached cooked for a day pork ribs with their special  Lino's ( first owner of the first shop at south yarra) secret baste marinade for two weeks, oh the eye fillet melts in my mouth, i still remember the taste of it. After working there i couldn't just eat any stake bought from supermarket for few years after i worked there. My review is based on how it was ten years ago though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaVlqaDR3RRAB,Was amazing best choice to go to for a tender juicy steak with good service and friendly staff food time was exceptional and flavour was awesome will be my new favourite in melbourne CBD
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMW92TzFBRRAB,Tired looking restaurant. Rude staff member who actually argued with my wife while trying to order her meal. How difficult is it to remove chips and salad and replace with broccoli? We were just about to get up and leave and another staff member came over as he saw there was a problem. The food was amazing. Shame it was spoiled by poor waitress service. The gents urinals were both blocked and rest room quite grubby. Will not return to this particular branch as our experience in South Yarra Squires Loft was so much better.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzLUtDOUdBEAE,Steak was well cooked and delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoenMtMzF3RRAB,Love my soy mocha and Shashuka. Very tasty and reasonable price. Shop was so busy but the service was quick.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaU5qajNnRRAB,This place is very warm and welcoming. The owner really cares about his customers. Their sandwiches and coffee are among the best I have tried.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmM2a29BRRAB,"Delicious, best sandwich in Melbourne (and it was GF!). Highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa2Ridk5REAE,"Grabbed a tall latte with a few pumps of vanilla. Great taste, and nice and hot. üëå"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdi1YamhnRRAB,Delicious and reasonably priced!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtODdpZ0dREAE,Great coffee. Great eggs. Great service. Great vibe. I really am happy I found you guys.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtLXE3bGFREAE,"Came to Workers Food Room today for group dine in. Grabbed a chai latte and a Cauliflower and Halloumi wrap toasted. The wrap was divine! Great flavours, fresh, and well toasted. Chai was great. The rest of the table was happy with their fried chicken flatbreads. Prices were pretty reasonable at $12.90 for a dine in wrap.  Only notes: - Sandwiches and salads all appeared to be pre made and catered more toward take away patrons - I don't doubt they are made same day as this cafe is very popular - Table service is available however this is difficult without a menu - you're advised to choose your wrap or salad from the front counter - Menu selections rotate so don't rely on what is on the website  Overall a nice place for grab and go pre made salads and wraps. Be mindful that dine in is very casual and there is no menu with access to freshly made dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGJYNXRRRRAB,"Great place, has a fire place and the staff and coffee are fantastic üëèüëèüëè ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aU8tMFFREAE,Lovely lamb flatbread. Great price too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPanBQSTF3RRAB,All round favourite. Coffee and food are consistently great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd3VHOHJBRRAB,"Been a couple of times now. The salads are food for people who want to say they ate salad but just wanted a pile of greesy, salty, goopy food which was more like a cold home cooked weeknight meal and not something fresh. I also got a wrap a few weeks ago..This was meh and lacked flavour. I gave two stars because it's convenient if you work near by."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa05QdDJRRRAB,"This is a wonderful place. Food, Fireplace, coffee, staff and even the music are all above par. They open 5:30 am every morning and you can get one of the best coffees in Melbourne served to you in the morning.  This is truly a place to be for an early morning coffee by the fire, or an afternoon lunch with all the positive vibes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPanV6UG13RRAB,Friendly service and good food.  The house pickled carrot served as a garnish today was a taste sensation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdXJPR2t3RRAB,Great find on a cold morning. Eggs perfect.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc083dWl3RRAB,A buzzy lunch venue. Great food. Staff coped well with the lunchtime rush. Good coffee. Amazing pumpkin bread.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQya0pPc05nEAE,"Great coffee and quick service if you want a to go coffee. Depends who does the ordering for you. Most of them are very nice with their customers, but sometimes the casual staff can be snippy and impatient. Only rated 3/5 because of the one particular staff that was obviously not in the mood to do the job he signed up, but the other staffs are a 10/10."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanQ2ODB3RRAB,Good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM05uZzVRRRAB,Welcoming service with delicious coffee

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTlTV2tRRRAB,Consistently good Korean food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZtaGdRRRAB,"This place has really kind staff and really nice foods this place is the best to get some drinks. Even if they were busy they habe taken care of there customers. I really recommend this place to the people who are in cbd  Serving really good food and making customers feel good together. It's really nice to see how they take care of their customers even when they're busy, as you know the atmosphere in which they work."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa1p1NTlBRRAB,"Such a disappointment. The service was great, but the food was abysmal. I ordered the pork bulgogi which was acceptable, but the japchae an absolute bomb of sugar and salt. It was so unpalatable that I couldn't have any more than a few bites. Maybe they have better dishes, but I won't be coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodk52MnhRRRAB,The food is really good and the staff are friendly the price is right I really like it because the business hours are long. I highly recommend it if you want to eat Korean food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobkpUVnlBRRAB,"As a Korean gourmet, I think it is a place that provides the best taste, service, atmosphere, and price. If you come to Malvern, stop by once or twice. I recommend it. -marine.kim-"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek4zOTJ3RRAB,"Great vibes, great service, and great food!  The portions are quite large and are well worth the cost as the food tastes amazing. Definitely one of the tastier Korean food places I've had.  I would definitely recommend the cheese buldak! (beware it is a little spicy)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod0xYYnFRRRAB,"I really wanted to eat Korean food, so I searched it on Google and went there, but it was so much better than I thought!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjVhM3FnRRAB,"Sausage and tteokbokki is so yum!! Take a big group and get the hotpots, they're delicious but you'll need help finishing it. Arnold looked after us well, will be back again soon"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajhpNHFnRRAB,"We had been to the Russell St shop previously and it was good. This time we came to the Lonsdale one and we were served Samgyaetang (ginseng chicken soup) with FROZEN rice stuffing - using precooked frozen chicken is fine but really need to do a proper defrost before you put it into a soup.  We returned the chicken that was cut open to the kitchen and 10 minutes later the same pot came back... the chicken soup was just boiled on the stove again. But the rice had now spilled out of the chicken, the rice noodle and rice cake started to disintegrate, and the whole soup turned into a mess.  Got a refund for the soup and left. Really need to look at how the food is handled here because it's also a potential hygiene risk serving unthawed food...!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzgyTWtnRRAB,i will not go anywhere else for korean food. Yoon's keeps their standard well across their franchise
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN2NtZ293RRAB,Sunday surcharge was amazing hahaüëéüèº
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnVIeEVREAE,Food ok
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOUxTRzh3RRAB,"Sadly disappointed.  Service was quick, friendly and prompt; however, most of the dishes were lacking flavour. We would recommend the chicken feet, and pork hotpot. But the rose tteokbokki had a very overpowering cheese taste and the hotdog was underwhelming. Serving sizes were average, but more expensive than surrounding restaurants for what we received.  Other notes: Sunday has 10% surcharge. The music was also quite loud and paused sporadically, which was odd.  We probably won't be back :("
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE9mdllREAE,"Gamjatang was very disappointing, probably because I went there thinking it was one of the best Korean foods in Melbourne. The meat didn't smell and the broth was well used, but I wonder if it was done by a novice cook... The meat had to be cooked for at least 30 minutes more (it was hard to eat because it was tough), and the soup was stuffed with gochujang or something, and the vegetables and soup tasted separate. it happened"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbC1TemR3EAE,The Vegetable bibimbap is great The beef bones soup is good but too salty Overall is good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbThybld3EAE,recommended korean restaurant in melbourne CBD. Just sad Japchae isn't available that night ...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbzlicFBREAE,My husband and I ordered takeaway around 8:30pm. The restaurant was very busy but our food was ready quickly and very fresh. We both ordered the bulgogi. It was tasty and a very large potion. We probably could have shared. Would order from Yoon‚Äôs Kitchen again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenZieEhBEAE,"Food was great and the manager, Arnold, was super friendly. 10/10 would recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocy02eGZ3EAE,"We ordered Spicy chicken feet and Army soup, both are below average comparing with other restaurants on the same street. Would not go again‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOVpYYTRnRRAB,"weeknight visit Eating seafood soft tofu, tteokbokki, and tofu meat kimchi I went to another Korean restaurant and entered the house because of the long wait. Personally, it is expensive and the taste is not good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3VPZkt3EAE,"Good food, reasonably priced. Mala spicy chicken could do with a hell of a lot more sichuan pepper though. Cheeseburger spring rolls are an abomination against god but that's just my personal opinion. Food was good! Service was also really good & attentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoM01UbmpBRRAB,Came yesterday and waited long time for a table. There was a table but instead  the manager kept it. I was kept waiting and was forgotten until another staff asked. Dont order the pancake.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNzdxc3RBRRAB,Expensive Korean restaurant offered average food quality.  Seafood tofu soup is bland and a little tasteless.  Fried chicken is nice but small portion.   Spicy pork bulgogi isn't tasty enough.  Not sure will revisit in the future.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejlfYWxnRRAB,Arnold and the team handled an issue with my takeaway order extremely well and were highly professional the entire time. They explained to me what had happened and offered a fix to my problem free of charge. Can highly recommend this restaurant for great tasting Korean food and amazing service!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLS1EVElBEAE,Hands down the best HSP in Melbourne. Been ordered well over 100 times from these guys over the past 4+ years and I have not been disappointed once! I tried a couple of other places that were closer to me but was disappointed to the point where I will literally never order from anywhere else again. There kebabs are incredible as well!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdV8tUDVnRRAB,Best kebab and HSP ever in Melbourne! Moreover the crew are not only professional but also well behaved.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdS1fd3JBRRAB,"The best kebabs in the city, 10/10 I've gotten kebabs and snack packs from here so many times and everytime the food is delicious and the people who work here are so nice"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdTl1N2dnRRAB,Delicious food Enjoyed alot Quality Time spent with family
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaV9HUXJ3RRAB,"Normally I wouldn‚Äôt get on a Google review like this but I had to get on to express that this is hands down the worst ever experience I have ever had at a kebab joint. Chips were undercooked and cold, the meat was stale and hard and the cheese wasn‚Äôt even melted. Slack as, I feel as if I have been scammed out of my hard earned money"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOC0tQU9BEAE,"The food is delicious and always hot, the staff is friendly and attentive to customers. super recommended"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNDdDT2NnEAE,"I love it here. Their kebabs and HSPs are great, the employees are very friendly and always energetic. The prices are very affordable and they always give you free things with the food you buy. Love you guys!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN2RYNVVnEAE,Great experience overall. Awesome atmosphere with great food and quality service. Staffs were very friendly and my orders came out quick. This was like a last minute stop as this restaurant was not in my plan to try out. Good thing I stopped by to try it out and I was not disappointed. Chicken kebab was on point and the pepperoni pizza taste fresh. High recommended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN2VuNGFnEAE,"The kebabs here are amazing! Clean, and not messy like some can be. Great experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è Food absolutely delicious. HSP Good quality and quantity! Friendly staff! Quick service with smiling faces. Will come back again when I visit Australia."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamFhR2J3EAE,Best HSP in town Undoubtedly! I have ordered several times via Uber eats‚Ä¶they are the best
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSallpaldREAE,"Really good kebabs perfect for a late night feed. Veggies are fresh, meat is really tasty and the customer service is amazing! The staff are lovely people so I'll always come back here when I want a kebab"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWN2VThRRRAB,This place has left the best impression. Food so delicious and staff are helpful especially the ladies are lovely and cheerful :) great service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWVLYXZBRRAB,Such a wonderful experience!!! From the moment we arrive the staff were lovely. Food delicious üòã Definitely I will come back again! ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWZqajhBRRAB,"1)Without a doubt the best HSP in the city. Ended up going two nights in a row. Serving sizes are reasonable and generous. The large is a large (2x burger box), none of this round container of sadness BS, they‚Äôll even wrap it in foil for you, a surprising benefit as the cheese properly melts by the time you get it home. Meat to chips ratio is exactly what you want. The chips are correctly salted and crispy and the meat is similar to what you get at other places but they actually cook it properly and it comes out juicy and tender. Oh, and they don‚Äôt charge extra for cheese, because that would be sociopathic. The star is absolutely the garlic sauce though. It‚Äôs obvious they make it themselves and it‚Äôs a damn good recipe, light, refreshing and tangy, cuts through the heft perfectly. If I were to sum it up, it‚Äôs all the ingredients you know and love, but it‚Äôs prepared and arranged perfectly which makes it the best. If it were up to me, his would be the HSP specimen I would choose to put in the royal archives"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWJqb1R3EAE,"So delicious! All the staff are great people, good place for dinner"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX2RxVm5RRRAB,Very tasty food and fresh burgers. The signature sauce they use makes burgers great in taste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEk2a053EAE,Great service. Food was amazing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzZ1cVRnEAE,"This is easily in the top three Japanese food experiences I have had outside Japan and the best in Melbourne by far. I was on a tight schedule - a train to catch - but the Miso soup and sushi roll I was absolutely delicious. I will definitely return for a longer sitting.  They were full on a Sunday night, unsurprising given the excellent food and friendly service, so a booking would be prudent. They happily seated me in an otherwise reserved table when I explained needed to be out quickly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeloyRm9BRRAB,"The food is average, but charge over price anf portion quite small"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeVlqTTNnRRAB,"A little gem. Surprisingly good and simple Japanese food that wasn't too westernized. Sesame Spinach was super yum, Gyoza were really good. Had several of entree's shared and it was more than enough. Pleasant staff. Went back a few nights later and will keep it on my list of where to eat in Melbourne."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnVudEVBEAE,"Honestly pretty much the best Japanese food I have ever had. The staff are lovely, the atmosphere is calming, the food is absolutely delicious. I can't think of a single point of improvement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN1p6b0xREAE,Sushi tastes great although the price is a bit on the higher side. Staff are friendly and helpful. Restsurant set up quite cosy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMDV2ZGhnRRAB,"Had the banquet for 2. Cannot recommend it highly enough. The presentation, plating and quality of food was exceptional. Washed down with a saporro beer and warm sake. Booked for 7 and it was half an hour before we were served but the quality of food was worth the wait. It's a small venue so it may pay to make a booking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoazdtZnhBRRAB,We were so delighted by their amazing food! Everything we had was so fresh and delicious. My personal favourite would be the wagyu and foie gras rice!!! Each grain of rice carried the aroma of wagyu beef and foie gras fat perfectly well. Price was reasonable and staffs were friendly. I‚Äôd love to visit again. It‚Äôs a nice place to go with friends or family.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHFHcjlBRRAB,"The eel rice is classic, and the foie gras has a unique and tasty flavor. Great service!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNUtYWUx3EAE,"Taketori has been around for quite a while I reckon, I came across this place multiple times on social media and finally decided to try it yesterday night.  First of all, booking system is very weird. There is a Quandoo built in on their website, only which doesn‚Äôt seem to work at all. So I rang the restaurant multiple times and nobody answered the phone. Then moments later, a random phone number called back, with no introduction at all, the lady on the phone asked me in Chinese whether I‚Äôm trying to make a reservation. Confused with how they figured out that I am indeed a chinese speaking person and confirming whether she is calling from Taketori, I successfully secured myself a table.  Now I will focus on my experience at Taketori. Unagi three ways is highly recommended. The unagi was so soft and goes extremely well with the tea broth (chazuke). The sukiyaki was pretty solid, a lot of ingredients and some decent quality beef slices for only $60.  The lobster maki took almost forever to come out, it was served by the end of our meal. Which I was quite surprised as maki roll is something quite quick and easy to make. The lobster maki did not tasted good and is definitely not worth $30. There was a generous chunk of lobster within the roll indeed, however, it tasted very salty, I assume that it has been bathed in salt water earlier to preserve it‚Äôs freshness. Otherwise, they are using some sort of canned/prepackaged lobster meat. Not to mention that it had a tough and old texture.  For desserts, we ordered a matcha crepe cake but was served a yuzu crepe cake + a scoop of matcha icecream instead. We were only looking at the photos on the menu when ordering the cake, and an image of a matcha crepe cake was clearly printed on the menu. So we thought that‚Äôs what we would get. We double checked with the waitress and she first answered that they sold out on matcha crepe cake today. Given the circumstances, we tried the eat the yuzu crepe cake, and it was not nice at all. The yuzu cream was quite sour, which I think the sourness dominated the yuzu aroma completely. Tasted a bit like cream that have turned bad if you ask me. We approached the waitress again to see whether if we can get something else instead (at this point we still thought it was their mistake for not telling us matcha crepe cake is not available today). Then the waitress started telling us that the menu did say yuzu cake with matcha icecream, and showed us the menu to proof it. She was right, it‚Äôs just that the image and text on the menu didn‚Äôt match up. We took it as our mistake for not reading the menu details carefully though. But when we got our bill, it prints matcha crepe cake, so this leaves me with many questions in my head.  Service was attentive, but the waitress who served us looked angry the entire night. I just read another review posted a month ago mentioning the same issue. Not sure what makes her so angry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeE5IdmFBEAE,"This restaurant should be listed to one of the best Japanese restaurants in Melbourne üòãSo many special dishes you would never wanna miss. For me, top one first choice must be Wagyu Foie Gras Don, matched with Black truffle sauce. Also the miso black cod claypot is a must-try since it is not too salty or overpowering and it does not have uncomplimentary spices but still unbelievably tastyüåü"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNjRmd3dBRRAB,Beautiful good & delightful staff. Can‚Äôt recommend enough.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeGVhSm1nRRAB,"I have been going to this place to eat, except that the serving speed will be a little slow when there are many people, the price, taste and environment are all good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNXJ5bVp3EAE,"Delicious unagi rice, there are 2 pieces of unagi, reasonable price. Lunch set is recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb3Y3MEtBEAE,Really nice food and service! The only issue is there are too much options of food üòÅ ‚Ä¶

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOXJmX0JBEAE,The food is delicious and displayed nicely and the taste is truly Japanese.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbjRXVWxnRRAB,Nice food but terrible service. The waitress looks angry at all the time even when you pay the bill.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbGItTnJ3RRAB,"Fake sake, fake Wagyu, old oysters"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteHFMZmZREAE,"This was an amazing place for dinner, seem like the hotpot are the most popular item here. But that night was a little bit too warm for us, we had some ramen, Sushi, and sashimi instead. Serving was pretty quick, Char Siu was a little bit too crumbly, but all good. Karaege chicken are tasty, sashimi was fresh. the host was sweet and nice too üòÄ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMUlLdWJnEAE,"This is the 1st time we ate here. We really enjoy the great service and delicious dishes. We love everything, hotpot, wagyu rice, sushi, grilled seafood/fish and etc. This Japanese restaurant is very different from the others and we love all the taste here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc0pybnJRRRAB,Absolutely shittt costumer service. I just went there and asked the lady at front o use the restroom. She denied!!. Is it supposed to be like that like I am not Japanese. Should I be treated like this?. Worst experience ever!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaThha09nEAE,The $69 7 course banquet menu was well worth the price. Each dish was fresh and delicious and we left the restaurant feeling very satisfied. Great option for a date or catch up with a friend as it's only a 2 pax minimum to order! Will definitely visit again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbG95QzBBRRAB,My favourite restaurant- so fresh. Must try the scallops!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaHNmWkdREAE,"First time here and as other reviews, everything was perfect. The food was amazing, service was very quick (despite them being busy) and staff were friendly.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeHRYaXpBRRAB,"Amazing new Korean restaurant upstairs with indoor, outdoor, booth seating and more.  Atmosphere - Neon lights and K-pop playing makes this a very moody and atmospheric dinner spot. Opens till late too which is perfect! A lot more space than Jang Gun and Nana so getting seats here will be easier than lining up there.  Value - It came out $199 (drinks, no desserts) for 4 people but everyone was full after.  Service - You will be looked after well as all the staff seem to actually like working there.  Food - Lots of choices on the menu and we were not disappointed by any dishes.  Would definitely visit again and make this my regular Korean visit!"

Don't consider go to eat there. The price is insane compare to what you get. The wagyu beef in every meal were tough and rubbery. The taste is not original Korean at all.

Except for the guests who book the venue and get out of here The rest of the guests are of no value to you, are they? Hands and feet are so slow, one person orders more than 100 yuan of Wagyu It was delivered so late that the guests are already starving to death Anyway, all the waiters invite three Korean brothers and one young lady who are very good-looking and good-looking. Even if the guests are angry, just ask them to comfort them, and no one will blame them.  If this store is in China, it will definitely not be able to survive. The baking tray has been rotten like this, and no one has replaced it. Is it giving me cancer? Damn, I'm going to be pissed off, the action is slow, the baking tray is black, it's not cheap, I have to make it myself  Those who want to eat late at night can cook fusilli at home and don‚Äôt use this shop at all‚ù§Ô∏è  I've been to this store twice  I'm just having a good meal, why can't I even do that?

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlckpYNmtnRRAB,"Was really good. We had fried dumplings, chilli cauliflower, and the custard buns were really really good.  Food was served really quickly. We also had 30% off with the eat club."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlanVqQzFnRRAB,Not gud
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMUk3ZGtRRRAB,Quite possibly the worst food I‚Äôve had in Melbourne. I ordered on uber eats and the spring rolls and dumplings were terribly squishy and just as flavorless as the Shanghai Noodles.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ0kydHJnRRAB,"We managed to get a good deal off EatClub and the food was definitely worth it. Would‚Äôve been overpriced at full price. Fried wontons were amazing, chicken and prawn dumplings were alright. (the dough was a bit thick) Fried rice had good flavour but the rice was a bit hard, chicken wing had a decent crunch but tasted a bit old. Salted egg custard bun was really good! Wish it was warmer when it got to our table though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NS1HNTFRRRAB,"Average but will still give 4 stars because I had a good deal, the amount and quality was as I expected for the price.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjhxanN3RRAB,We ordered via UberEATS and it arrived quickly and everything was still warm and fresh. The serving sizes were a little on the small side but the food delicious. Loved the BBQ pork buns and the sweet and sour pork. The combination fried noodle and the spring rolls were just ok
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPakpYTFdnEAE,Amazingly average. Came here for an average meal and happily received the following: Great food Poor service No toilets on site  10/10 would come back here again. If it was any better I would be disappointed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMC0tQVF3EAE,"Oh dumplings is in Little Bourke St, in the same building with The Poke man. The staffs were polite and friendly. The quantity is pretty reasonable. Their Xiao Long Bao is tasty and good. If it comes with ginger sliced will be perfect. Their chicken fried rice and yellow chicken and prawn dumplings were a disappointment. The fried rice has wok fragrance but the rice sadly hard. The chicken and prawn dumplings were hard and tough to chew. Overall, it is a small restaurant with simple food , friendly staffs and delicious Xiao Long Bao."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydFlyaFVnEAE,"Nice atmosphere and good food, I had takeaway so not the full experience but still very good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEwydUpnEAE,"Sensational food, the staff are an absolute delight."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaWNmUXZnRRAB,We went to celebrate a special occasion. Perfect choice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ19pWVZ3EAE,"Great service, food was perfect and great wine list"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWJ6R2JREAE,Great food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeVlEbl9RRRAB,Arguably the best pasta I've had in Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMks2TndRRRAB,Che buono! We spent lunch at Caterina‚Äôs and it was fabulous. The dishes were just so tasty and delicious and the staff very friendly!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobF83bXlRRRAB,"Wow! This place is a real hidden gem. Tucked in the basement of 221 Queens St, you‚Äôd never know it‚Äôs there. When the lifts opened directly into the restaurant, it was like we were transported to a rustic restaurant somewhere in Italy. Staff were super attentive and courteous. Best of all, the crumbed pork chop was done to perfected and that cheesey slaw was just yum! Also had some specials of the day - duck prosciutto and whipped salted cod roe on brioche :) everything tasted amazing and just such a nice find! Will be back to try other things on the menu! Love love love!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocHFxYkp3EAE,One of Melbourne's Best Restaurant with Service Food Wine List at the very best you can get one of my favourites
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbGZ2Yl9nRRAB,Old school professional hospitality at its best!!! Catarina and her team are just outstanding in any aspect of service and food‚Ä¶. Will be back many more times and will recommend to anyone. Well done and thank you for looking after us so well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeU9POW13RRAB,Very good and authentic Italian food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbUtDYWpnRRAB,"I booked the wrong date for a Christmas lunch and arrived to a fully booked service. Caterina's could not have gone out of their way to accommodate us, despite the inconvenience for them. They could've turned us away but instead made us feel completely  welcome. Very impressed. Waitress reeled off the extensive specials menu like it was a performance. We were all looking for a teleprompter but no, she knew her stuff. Food was beautiful, waiters attentive. Amazing ambience. If it wasn't so well known you'd call it a hidden gem. Definitely a go to for any occasion. Thank you, again!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDYtSml3RRAB,"Wow, a last minute find but so happy we did. Table for 7 was great and food even better! Wine was well priced and food choices were excellent. Staff knowledgeable and accommodating. A surprisingly great last minute lunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtX3YzNkV3EAE,"My husband and I just love this place! I have never seen my husband get emotional over food before!! I hope this Iconic place just keeps going on forever. It is Italian food at its best, served with care and passion. One of the great meals of our life!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN2RhYXhBRRAB,"Went here for lunch, service was absolutely terrible. I asked a waitress if I could order food and she went off and said yes she will get someone. Nobody came, I asked another waitress to order food and she said, yes I'll just get someone. Nobody came. Third time lucky. Finally when somebody did come to take my order, they had no idea what the gnocchi was and asked if I wanted the mash potatoes. I pointed at the option on the menu and she went off to ask someone about it. When my order was finally taken the waitress walked off and then another person came to read me what the specials were... okay. The same kind of thing happened when I asked to pay the bill. 2 different waitresses I had to ask. Then her receipt got jammed and asked me to hang on. I just walked out. Frustrating place. The food was also quite average.  *In response to your comment below, you are absolutely off your trolley if you think my food order was taken 8 minutes after I sat down.. more like my water order was taken 8 minutes afterwards, I wasn't even given a food menu for absolutely ages, I had to ask for one. Not sure where you are getting these made up time frames from and I did not complain about melbourne traffic on the phone to your staff... I simply said I'm stuck in traffic, would it be an issue if i arrived 30 minutes late? your response is just an example of how unprofessional the customer service is in this place and I'm not the only one to mention this it seems, from past bad reviews."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtalA3LXVnRRAB,"awful service and food is absolutely horrible. Not fine dining at all, not sure how they have a chefs hat. Who is giving out these bloody chefs hats to restaurants? Wild."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaklHNmx3RRAB,below par
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMHAyOGd3RRAB,Such a good restaurant. Very long lunch. Daily specials are always the go to.  Great wine list. Service is attentive and very personal. Highly recommend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlal9xYzNBRRAB,"Truly no words can describes this place from service, atmosphere, friendliness and food truly superb üëå We enjoyed everything we ordered and if you need some beautiful time with your ‚ù§Ô∏è one‚Äôs this is truly the place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldF9TcHNnRRAB,Service was impeccable and the food simply Devine.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbmVLd1RnEAE,Amazing food and service! A Melbourne gem
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHI2MC1BRRAB,"My go-to for jjajangmyeon! It is kinda hidden down the quiet side of Little Burke St so there's no long wait each time for me, especially on days when I just want food quickly. They do the best Gochu Jjajangmyeon, perfect amount of spice every time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaG82Tk1nEAE,"After covid, Food and service quality are declined."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN1pXRUNBEAE,Poor reservation experience:( booked in advance for a table for 15 but didn't let us know when its closed due to gas outage...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGMyejZBRRAB,Traditional Korean-style Chinese cuisine met in Australia
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodWZfOUJnEAE,Office lunch fix here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXBEdHRnRRAB,"Best Jajiang Myeon in town so far! Place is quite spacious and service was okay as you self serve for utensils, water and pickles."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMDZyejFRRRAB,Jjambbong was more delicious than I thought. Should I say that the taste of jajangmyeon is a bit mild?? It wasn't bad though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMFppZjVRRRAB,"The best jajangmyeon, there‚Äôs something about it that‚Äôs different from other Korean restos. Would have been nice if the tangsuyuk was served along with the jajangmyeon and not after we finished it nonetheless, it was worthy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMHVUdkd3EAE,"Best jajangmyeon in town, over many years and also love the Tangsuyuk. Yummy üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc1B5cVR3EAE,Came in on a Friday night at 8pm and told they were already closed due to no more food. Not sure why they ran out of stuff when the place wasn't that busy when I arrived.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbnBQUnNRRRAB,"Big portions, friendly staff, serve yourself as much kimchi and danmuji as you want so you feel no shame in asking for more. Can't ask for more"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdE9HUU1nEAE,"Quantity and delicious,, It is the best Korean Chinese restaurant in Melbourne. I have ordered jjajangbap (fried rice) twice a day,, The seasoning is a bit on the strong side. The first time I went, I ordered spicy jjajangmyeon, but it was really spicy. A spicy mark means it's really spicy. One of my favorite restaurants"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcEpLRTh3RRAB,Great value for money. But I think the jajjang rice is way too large üòÇ
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeC0ya0NnEAE,This is a Jjambbong restaurant in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNzVPdnhBRRAB,Really good taste It‚Äôs a little bit expensive but food it‚Äôs really nice Love it  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- When I came to the shop on 4/Jan /2023 ZhengBanJjaZang Only have onions Doesn‚Äôt have any seafood or meat Really disappointed Hope they can change like last year.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNC1QT3NBRRAB,"It's a better restaurant than I expected. (Probably, likes and dislikes vary depending on the food) The food is cleaner than I thought, and the AI-like male boss and his wife look at the store, and the water, spoon, chopsticks, and pickled radish are self-serve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcGVmVmdRRRAB,"We have neen visiting this place for many, many years, and always come for jajjangmyeon. They know how to cook jajjangmyeon properly. Ïñ∏Ï†úÎÇò ÎßõÏûàÎäî Ï†ÑÌÜµÏßúÏû•Î©¥ üòãüòã  Many new restaurants open in Melbourne claiming that they serve ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô jajjangmyeon or receive endorsements from food bloggers, but their taste is just average (some of them serve horrible jajjangmyeon).  Jajjangmyeon portion in Korchi is always big, taste always delicious (just like what we always have in our hometown üá∞üá∑üá∞üá∑), price is reasonable.  After the pandemic, a lot of Korean restaurants in Melbourne has lost their so-called Korean touch, but Korchi still has that. All staff are Korean. When customers come/ go, they always greet in Korean.  Will come back again and again, for more jajjangmyeon üá∞üá∑üòãüçú and bibimbab"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa2RLdzFBRRAB,Ordered prawns with spicy garlic sauce. Took a very long time then gave me prawns with sweet and sour sauce. Very annoyed. The same restaurant in Clayton is 10X better. Go to the clayton Branch.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX0s2SjdBRRAB,"Good place for korean noodles, prices reasonable and the serving size is very generous, will come back"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX1BUcnJ3RRAB,It's not bad. It's delicious. It's cheap. The boss is a Korean couple There are quite a lot of Koreans here to eat
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOUtiQ05nEAE,"If you dont know that the place is inside Hilton, you‚Äôll probably have a hard time looking for the place like we did.  Food is good and great ambiance though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScExDV0R3EAE,"It was my first times at Luci. I decided to go this restaurant because I thought it is a part of high standard Hotel name as Hilton. But sadly, the way Me and my friends were treated at restaurant made us feel like we were not welcomed there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeF9ISS1BRRAB,"Great food and fantastic staff. Charlotte was warm, friendly, professional and attentive - made our evening excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob3I3ZFlnEAE,"Ambience looks inviting  fif not eat a meal, just some canapes. Need to go bacj"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaktXLUpnEAE,Pricey but very nice environment
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek03UjhRRRAB,"Definitely recommend the chef's tasting menu for a special occasion - every dish was mouthwatering and perfectly paired with delicious and interesting local wines. I especially enjoyed the crab and the pork fillet. Excellent service, too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMGNLbHpRRRAB,"A fantastic selection.  An amazing flavour selection with great potential.  It just lacked finesse with some presentation, the portion sizes are mis-matched between dishes and the sauces range from jelly to water.   Great venue, and fantastic staff.  Nearly there, but not quite."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCb01LZldnEAE,"Came here for the first time tonight, great food, excellent service, fantastic venue. Would recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCb01EUDlBRRAB,"Went here for dinner, nothing special about this place. Mains took 55 minutes to come out after entrees after continuously asking when our mains will be ready. Responses were always vague ‚Äúit‚Äôs on its way‚Äù. Honestly, just eat somewhere else"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDRxa2FREAE,"Attentive staff, beautiful interior and delicious food. Great for group bookings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbmFlX3F3RRAB,Tea was not hot enough
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdmU2d2VnEAE,"Friendly service, but the portion of the food is too small even for a hotel like Hilton & its price point. The food were good but nothing spectacular. Much better food out there in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMnFlRG53RRAB,Great restaurant. We had the Chef's menu and everything was delicious. Very nice place and great service. Perfect for a date.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX05UNHV3RRAB,"It was our first time in this place. Beautiful ambience, delicious food, great staffs. We'll return here for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNkppTnNBRRAB,Very nice restaurant in the Hilton hotel.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcTViY3VBRRAB,Friendly helpful staff Breakfast was tasty but unexciting Amazing art deco interiors of the dining room
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMF9Lb0xBEAE,Beautiful staff in a beautiful building with great food and atmosphere to boot! Feel like I found a little hidden gem.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMkpTTHF3RRAB,"Truly outstanding. We dine out several times per week and rarely say we will return as we always like to try new places. This is one place we would return in a heartbeat. Beautiful fit out and decor, outstanding food and perfect service. They even offered to customise the mains to our taste. Just go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjVxcXRnRRAB,Had a great breakfast here. Recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NV92T093EAE,"Booking for 2 ppl on last Saturday night for my b-day!!! The food was so delicious, the restaurant look so fancy I love it but when the girls that serve our dessert she didn‚Äôt give us the spoon and my ice cream melt it but still I will give it 5 stars bc my b-day with my friends is going well!! But plz be more care about it, will definitely going back there!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXJfNUxREAE,"Ordered the soy marinated crab, pork bone soup and somac set.  The pork bone soup was the highlight! It almost felt like beef. The meat just falls of the bone and it‚Äôs flavorful and tender.  Note:  1/ The soup doesn‚Äôt come with rice so we added the handmade noodles and it was amazing.  2/ This place doesn‚Äôt serve banchans either but it‚Äôs OK!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb1BQTWt3RRAB,Fancy some K Sashimi?üê†You must check out this Korean restaurant in the CBD! ‚ú®They specialise in fresh Korean sashimi that you won‚Äôt find in most other Korean restaurants. It is a great spot to chill and late night drinks. üçª
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSal96eDJnRRAB,"Nice place for light meals. Cold noodles, clam soup, octopus, sashimi and sashimi kimchi very good."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN1lxQ2pnRRAB,"Amazing little joint with the most amazing staff! Food was really good, highly reccomend the marinated crabs and the seafood pancake!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbWQ3SUtnEAE,Went there for their seafood but honestly I think the pork bone soup was the best dishes we had that night. The pork was super tender and the potatoes were the cherries on top.  The sashimi and marinated carbs were fresh and weren‚Äôt fishy. Dipping the red pepper sauce was a tasty way to enjoy the sashimi.  Staff was attentive and caring too :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeE1fbWlnRRAB,It's so delicious. It's open late and the food is delicious. The boss is also great!!! lol
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDZuOE1REAE,3.5/5 stars ‚Äì solid authentic Korean food! Lovely cozy atmosphere too. It‚Äôs a bit more on the expensive side though and the service was a let-down. Doesn‚Äôt exactly leave a good taste in your mouth when you see the manager of the store frequently attend to an influencer‚Äôs table while neglecting everybody else‚Äôs.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZzh6b1RREAE,The quantity was small for the price (This plate is medium) It may be more because the plating is different from other reviews but  It tasted good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmUyR0x3EAE,Lovely and cozy restaurant. Food was delicious. Sashimi platter was super fresh. Noodle pepper seafood tasted very home cooked and soothing for the belly. Seafood pancake tasted good. Excellent place~
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHNfZG5nRRAB,"My friend and I had just arrived in Melbourne CBD in the late evening and we were looking for a place to eat at 11pm. We saw that Sool Tong closes at 3am, so we decided to give it a try. And we are so glad that we did!  We ordered the spicy chicken feet and the Korean-style beef short ribs.  The spicy chicken feet was cooked perfectly so the meat fell off the bones with ease, and the spicy flavor was really addicting.  The Korean-style beef short ribs were definitely one of the best I've ever had. Again, it was cooked perfectly. Enough to be tender, but not so much that it was tough. On top of that, the flavor was also amazing.  tl;dr: Really authentic hole-in-the-wall Korean restaurant. The food was really fantastic. You gotta come try it at night!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLU1lMHZBRRAB,Great vibes w great food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobUpEd1RBEAE,The combination of raw octopus and crab soup makes you drink a lot of soju.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaWM3M25BRRAB,We tried the Chef special menu and spicy fish soup. The special menu is so good especially the soy crab. And I really like the spicy fish soup! I recommend having the soup with handmade noodle
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocnV1dFpREAE,"Loved the interior decorations, provided a very cosy vibe and was perfect for a late night outing. Couldn't have found a better place to relieve that mid night craving of fried chicken!!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdDVYajZBRRAB,"Very delicious food, would come again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdDhYbFZREAE,The water is above average for a Melbourne restaurant. Additionally the pour of the bottle was quite smooth.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaDdXbmVBEAE,really enjoyed our meal!! highly recommend trying the chefs signature set which comes with 8 classic korean dishes for $42!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOC1pWWp3RRAB,Very tasty and authentic Korean restaurant. Friendly staff. Would visit again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMS0tSVpBEAE,"Saw a staff wear a shirt saying whoever gives them a goos review gets a free beer. I was gonna give a good review anyway!  Easy to order, food was good. Toilet was clean, service was exceptional."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScjZhU1Z3EAE,Best experience really good food thanks Johnny
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScjhEaTh3RRAB,This place is running a scam! They've listed multiple restaurants in uber eats with different names and doesn't deliver anything
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNTlybXF3RRAB,One of the best pizza in Melbourne that I've had.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmZYdGdBRRAB,"Had the vegetarian pasta with pesto, and it was one of the best one, creamy and thick."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdGJYZVhnEAE,"The delivery Ubereats took the order, but no one delivered it, and they would not cancel the order. It made people wait for 2 hours. I contacted Google map to chat, and I didn‚Äôt reply to the message after reading it. Very irresponsible restaurant, please review look at your staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdGVyU3Z3RRAB,Looks like they don‚Äôt have anything for vegans‚Ä¶ gross.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVlMOFFnEAE,"Booked and Went there at 12:30pm on a Sunday, advertised as open. I arrive and it‚Äôs closed. No sign on the window and when I called, no answer EDIT: you guys literally just changed your opening hours after I wrote this review and didn't get back to me"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMm9qd0xREAE,"This is by far NOT the best Italian restaurant in Melbourne. In fact, the only Italian thing are the items on the menu. 1. Italian beer was not available 2. I felt like walking into a nightclub - music was blasting out of the speakers 3. Apart from the restaurant being almost empty, I got seated at a dirty table.  Now, regarding the food:  Until last week, I did not know, that you can get/buy squid rings made ‚ÄòMcNugget‚Äô style. It was the most disgusting thing I‚Äôve eaten in a while and in fact - did not finish it. I would give 0 stars if I could. The best Italian restaurant should know and do better‚Ä¶üí•  Arancini were cold in the centre but had somewhat of a flavour to them. But again, I assume they were not freshly made. üí•üí•  The best food I had, was actually the gnocchi. Too salty and portion size was too small for the price in my opinion. üí•üí•üí•  Would not recommend. Better dining options within a 100 meter radius for sure."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEt6dUdBEAE,"Pretty disappointed.  Good reviews online, but it took an hour to get our first round of drinks (which were in suspiciously varying quality and dirty glassware), pizza was very oily and on thick mass produced bases. Wedges were all broken up and crispy outer cases with no potato, which meant they were shattered in the freezer, and not checked for quality. Pasta took an extra 30 mins to come out for the same table. They brought us the wrong number of drinks and meals. Tables were really scratched and did not look clean. Big finger marks all over the windows. Soap sitting on top of the plumbing pipes in the bathroom. Everything just looked rickety, dirty, low quality and the service was not much better.  Will not go again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScjRHM0RBEAE,"I ordered a meal from this restaurant, and they let me wait for 1 hour, then tell me they are close."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b0lPSHRRRRAB,Great food and service. Will be back. Me and my friend loved it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVotbW5nRRAB,"Both the food and drinks had so much flavour! All I say to anyone booking a table, wear loose fitting clothes because the food tastes that good you can't stop ü§£"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2FEWWhBRRAB,It was amazing! The Kaiserschmarrn and the Weihenstephaner beer are really good. I definitely recommend to check out the Gasthaus and enjoy the food and beer!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXNLRnJ3RRAB,What an absolute pleasure it was to have authentic German / Austrian food. Spetzele was on point! As well as the strudel. They also have a list of house made items you can purchase to take away in regards to authentic smallgoods. This morning I'm enjoying leverwust as if I'm back home in Germany! Thank you üòä
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaW9uekpBEAE,"Absolutely delicious ü§§ we were recommended this warm & welcoming place by my daughter & partner who loved their delectable bread & butter pudding. Christian the hard working owner & chef üë©‚Äçüç≥ welcomed us & asked us if we needed any help with them menu & drinks . So nice & rare to get to chat to the chef His staff are also lovely His genuine passion for his food shines through in his wonderful conversation & all the dishes - he adores feeding people & loves his customers . we had sausages, sauerkraut, potatoe salad, melt  in the mouth snitzel  , never tasted anything like it ! Made with love ‚ù§Ô∏è as Christian himself says . Raspberry schnapps & wine üç∑ recommended by Christian made us extremely satisfied can‚Äôt wait to come back .. worth the trip from the surf coast .."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkxUcENREAE,My dad loves this restaurant!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM09DLXpnRRAB,"My family is Austrian, so finding somewhere in Melbourne where I can get not only a decent schnitzel but a proper *Austrian* schnitzel was such a godsend. Honestly, whether you're looking for schnitzel, rouladen, salted pretzel, or just some damn good beer, this is the place to go. It's a heavy lunch, perhaps, but for dinner it's perfect. A great Heuriger-like atmosphere. Heartily recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaFpPUjFnRRAB,Best German/Austrian in Melbourne at the moment.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2ZXYnFBRRAB,"Dinner was greater, however the sp√§tzle that came with the Rindergulasch was fair to say below average, for quite a simple dish, the sp√§tzle should not be watery, and especially at this price point it is unacceptable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2ZDYkN3EAE,Had the most amazing food and the best customer service. Thank you Constantine you gave everything a customer would like to experience dinning out; thank you so much for your snapps recommendations.  I absolutely üíØ loved the pine cone snapps üòçü§© and the hat was the icing on the cake. I will be back next time I am in Melbourne. I highly recommend this quaint Austrian cuisine restaurant.üëå üòã üòç üëç‚ù£Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2FEQmt3RRAB,Food was delicious and service was excellent. Constantine was brilliant and his schnapps recommendations were perfect.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenY3cVV3EAE,Very disappointed. The soup entree was good - Frittatensuppe and the Dessert Kaiserschmarrn was ok. But the Wiener Schnitzel mit Potato Salad was very average. I had to pay an extra $2 to have the Schnitzel pan-fried in butter - but the result tasted more as having been deep-fried. The Potato Salad looked brownish and did not resemble anything I had eaten in Austria as Potato Salad (Erdapfelsalat). I also ordered the Beansalad for $20 as it stated it was prepared with Pumpkin Seed Oil which I love - but I could not taste the oil at all. I tasted the Sauerkraut from my companions plate and it was far too salty and her Schweinsbraten was far too fatty (as they use Porkbelly instead of Neck or Shoulder). So she had hardly any meat on her piece....expensive for $38. Only two Austrian white wines to choose from and the Veltliner was out of stock?! The staff were stressed; and did not really understand the dishes. Real pity - the Austrian cuisine is so famous; but not really demonstrated at the Gasthaus.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbEx2cERnEAE,The Gasthaus Platte family sharing plate serves four was good except for the sauerkraut which was too salty. The sausages were very good but not enough on the platter. Service was good Value was good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDR6VV9nRRAB,"If you ever have the desire for German / Austrian cuisine, you are in good hands here Ate delicious nice attentive staff We can only recommend March 23"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodklxVzR3RRAB,"Amazing place, lovely customer service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoak52M2t3RRAB,"Delicious Austrian meals, beer and wine. We enjoyed our lunch and will definitely come back. Thank you Christian and team."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUxHWnpBRRAB,I was hoping to find good Austrian food. The food was good but the service poor. We ordered soup for starters and the pork knuckle for main. They arrived together. Had to ask for spoons to eat the soup so our main was no longer warm when we got to it. Spoilt the evening for me.  Disappointing. Won't be going back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocjRTakpREAE,"Best chicken schnitzel in Melbourne, best Austrian restaurant I‚Äôve been to! Awesome beer ! Definitely will be back here ! Thank you !!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocjVqN0V3EAE,"All our respect to this amazing chef!!! Everything was simply delicious!!!! Authentic, wholesome, freshly cooked and really, really good!!! A very enjoyable and equally memorable dinner. Thank you so much!!!! Definitely coming back!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeS1hVS13RRAB,"Great service, pork knuckle shared plate for 2 is easy enough for 3"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWVtWUF3EAE,Friendly service. Quick. Yum.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWE2V0lBEAE,Great food.  Austrian menu was excellent and very distinguishable from the mass market German restaurant chains in town. Looking forward to going back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWNhMndBRRAB,The best Austrian food I have ever had on my travels. We had a platter for 4 and it was very delicious and the Service was perfect.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmJfdTVRRRAB,Fantastic platter for 4 people. Wonderful service and great atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N1BMVDlBRRAB,Very very average food ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not much of a cook but could definitely do better at home. Would not go again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajV5SXN3RRAB,"After booking a table, we waited for 2 hours to be seated to find out half the menu was unavailable. It was a joke , dont recommend it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczZyZV93RRAB,Food was average.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWVUZUZ3EAE,Firstly first was amazing We had pork belly kids had burgers and we had wings as an Entre all were superb. Hands down great service and fantastic food. Highly recommend. Did have an a intial blunder with a flat drink being served which was quickly rectified with a smile. Great customer service even better food. Good clean amenities. Special thanks to the hard working head chef. Could tell he was passionate about his job and providing 5 star food and service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGM3dTFRRRAB,Ordered a meatlover pizza which took 45 mins and the base was burnt and even though the menu show the price as $18 the actual charge was $22. Everyone in the group was overcharged. Totally understand why the place was quiet during the lunch rush.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXNMYVl3EAE,Enjoyed drinks and lunch. Excellent service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHJXQ1BREAE,Good music plenty of banter from the waiter
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkw2ZWF3EAE,Food was good. Waiter entertaining. Unfortunately we were pushed for time. Next time hopefully a bit more time spent enjoying it all.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOU8yZzFRRRAB,"Really good food, like it"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDQzYkhBEAE,"Before booking we read the reviews and quite honestly the owner and his staff must write them themselves! The place was cruby, the toilets atrocious. The toilet looked that they had not been cleaned pre covid! I'm not kidding. A real indication that the health department is completely non exsiatant!! I ordered a simple dish grilled samon with chips. My samon was raw and the chips hard and oily! I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I'm surprised that we didn't get food poisoning. I am giving it a well deserved 2 out of 5 because the man who served us was very accomodating in contrast to the lady waitress who was pretty in different and almost dismissive! Please guys give the venue a good clean especially your toilets!!!!! I'm still trumatised!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTVfZG1RRRAB,"David provided some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant. He's quite humorous, knowledgeable, and extremely good at what he loves. The meal was awesome the vibe was immaculate and I will be back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN1phSWZnEAE,The location and service was the best part of the night Food definitely not worth eating
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbFpQS2lBRRAB,"the mill burger gave me food poisoning. also, the cutlery i was given was still dirty :("
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbFo3N29nRRAB,"If we could give The Mill and Charlie‚Äôs Bar a 20000 stars we would as they made our night out fantastic. The laneway was pumping with people eating outside and in at the many restaurants. I had chosen The Mill to celebrate my partners 50th and the staff made all attempts to make it special. Lovely staff, balcony table for two to take in the laneway environment. The menu was packed with so many choices, we had bruschetta to share, seafood linguine and a gorgeous mustard chicken breast with mash and veggies which was to die for. On my asking they brought out their brownie with a candle. The staff constantly checked on us and the lovely manager offered my partner a shot on the house for his birthday and when we went downstairs to the bar he made us both a gorgeous unique cocktail which was delicious. We will definitely be back and encourage others to do the same . Katherine and Chris"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHRuTUNREAE,"I stopped into The Mill Restaurant to grab some lunch and a drink, I was met by a lovely and welcoming man named David behind the bar in which I believe is the manager. I had an eye fillet cooked to perfection and walked out of there very satisfied. The restaurant itself plus Charlie's bar was an amazing warm atmosphere that made me feel as though I was elsewhere in the world. Between David, the food and the restaurant/ bar they deserve every single star that I have given them and i will certainly be returning"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeExqalZREAE,"Went there on the 25/03, we came early to a booking just happy to have a few drinks while we waited for our booking. We were welcomed with with 110% service. We got a beautiful seat next to the window over looking the laneway. The owner/manager was cracking great jokes and just made us feel welcome. The food was delicious and the drinks went down nicely! Highly recommend and will go back again when we visit the city."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHZxMi1RRRAB,"Close at 11pm, called 9:38pm fot take-away, hear the kitchen is closed"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3JuZllREAE,"One of the best meals I have ever eaten! Amazing flavour and my chicken was cooked to perfection! Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Just the absolute best in a cosy romantic setting ‚ù§"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHFpRWRREAE,Great cocktails
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ295LUdBEAE,"Staff were friendly, service and food was very quick and nice. The spot was quite nice, we went on a Saturday so it was busy everywhere, this restaurant wasn't as busy though. When we went to pay the owner fixed us up and suggested a shot, he let us try some and then we bought another. Owner and staff were great. Would recommend:)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeUpua1BREAE,"Wonderful location - bustling, interesting and ever so metropolitan.  Wait staff were excellent - so attentive, friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Meals were substantive, presented beautifully and extremely tasty.  Will definitely be returning here, and recommending it to friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobDhxc3RBRRAB,"The best local cuisine I've ever had. A variety of dishes that feel contemporary and fresh and have the restaurant's unique spin on them, not to mention that they are cooked to perfection. Although the menu is fairly small, it is well-formed. This restaurant exuded the friendliest, most welcome vibe. The service provided was excellent. Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWNYMEhBEAE,Had the Bruschetta and the pizza Margherita and it tasted delicious...  Friendly staff members!  Thank you...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk5pQUlnEAE,"An amazing place hidden in Hardware Lane. The atmosphere was fantastic with excellent table service and even better food. We had Eye Fillets with Pear and Rocket salad, we could not fault what was served. This place is highly recommended üôèüèº"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4elBEZVhBEAE,Wow just wow we ate here today for my hubby‚Äôs birthday and the food was amazing Hubby had the steak and I had the prawns the prawns were full of beautiful flavour succulent prawns creamy soft mash wow highly recommend the prawns here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cE9tcGZ3EAE,Great food! Sam was really accomodating and helped make it such a great experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cEtubkx3EAE,Great food and Sam is the best
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFpmdTNRRRAB,"The service was great and the food was awesome, everything was cooked to perfection. The steaks and the chocolate mousse were especially good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk5YWlN3EAE,Got to taste kangaroo meat here! Good ambience and good food. A bit pricey but the quality of food do not disappoint.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk9qYWJ3EAE,"Food ‚≠êÔ∏è 1/5 The quality of the food at the restaurant was below average. The chips were both dry and in meager quantity. The steak was difficult to chew, cold, and tough. While the pasta was acceptable, it had an excessive amount of ham and was overcooked.  Service ‚≠êÔ∏è 1/5 Regrettably, the restaurant appears to be biased towards certain groups of customers. For instance, if you are dining alone or happen to be Asian, you will be directed to the outdoor seating area immediately. This was evident when two Caucasian gentlemen in front of us arrived without a reservation and were promptly seated inside. However, when it was our turn, the host did not greet us, check for empty tables inside, or make small talk. Instead, she simply told us to find someone outside to assist us with seating, despite there being available tables inside at the time. It was not until later, when I went to pay at the cashier, that I noticed that most of the customers seated inside were Caucasian or part of their group, and only Asians and solo diners are seated outside.  Moreover, our elderly waiter made us feel uncomfortable by constantly hovering near our table and watching us. As soon as we were seated and began to look at the menu, he returned to inform us that the kitchen would close in just four minutes, and we needed to order now. It was perplexing why no one had informed us about the kitchen's closing time beforehand. Additionally, no one explained the menu or the day's specials, making us feel unwelcome.  I like Hardware Ln and it‚Äôs lively vibe, but I‚Äôm very sure that I won‚Äôt come back to this place‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeklMRXhBRRAB,"If I could give this zero star I cloud. Steak taste really bad, I‚Äôm not even finish my ice chocolate yet they don‚Äôt even ask me anything some white girl just took it away. don‚Äôt waste your time and money from here. Waitress are so rude. U should hire some more friendly people that really want to work this job."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdE5XLWlBRRAB,The staff were absolutely lovely and the kangaroo was soooooooo good!  Top notch service and fantastic food for a good price. Will be back again and again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdE9xajZ3RRAB,"Beautiful place with a delicious food, friendly staff and excellent service. As the group of 8 we enjoyed every meal we ordered, starting from lovely fresh oysters, moving to perfectly done steaks and seafood pastas, then finishing with a delicious dessert, definitely will be back ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdDRlR0VREAE,"Had a lovely meal here. Food was satisfying and the service was excellent, especially Sam! Thank you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHNLTzBBRRAB,"Friendly welcome, we had the kangaroo, excellent, with finally some vegetables, would have deserved to be a little warmer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN0lEQUhBEAE,Cosy place with great food. The steak with blue cheese butter is perfectly done!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU5YanFBRRAB,There are better places
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbFA2NVl3EAE,"Great location, tasty food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc05UM1hnEAE,Here is the hot tip friends. Whatever Sam - our concierge at this beautiful restaurant - reccomends - TRUST!  His reccomendation of the passionfruit sorbet and the panacotta - might be the very best I've ever had.  The rest of the menu and the dishes we watched pass us - had our mouths totally watering. We are already booking in our next visit and may not eat all day so we can eat several different things here. YUMMM
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoazk3a2hnRRAB,"Not overly impressed. Both of our coffees came out at 50¬∞. Even when one was supposed to be 100¬∞. The barista remade one coffee and when it came back to us it still wasn't over 80¬∞, it also wasn't strong like we had asked. Couldn't be bothered sending it back a second time. The Parma was ok. It really could have benefited from some ham. The sauce was a bit lack luster. Nothing very flavoursome. The service was great though. Both servers were very attentive and had professional mannerisms."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ19PM3FnRRAB,"All the staff members provided good service. Among them, I became a fan of the old waiter. It's a pity that it was forgotten because they were busy ordering drinks, but they quickly recovered. Came here to try the kangaroo steak. It was well cooked and delicious. The table was also properly disinfected."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX1oyLUl3EAE,"Pork Belly was soft with no crispyness... this may be the way the dish is but it wasn't described that way. Also.... VERY CONCERNING was a $10 tip automatically added to the bill without my knowledge. I was told the bill, but the receipt shows extra charge. I know it's legal but requires customers to be advised up front... really poor approach."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGZDU2dRRRAB,"Thought our options on a public holiday were limited. How wrong we were. The food was delicious, wine smooth and delightful. Friendly staff were the veritable icing on the cake. Would love to visit again üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWNxUU53EAE,"Excellent service, food was that of italian quality (perfection)  In my opinion, best breakfast - lunch cafe in Melbourne for young people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ2R5N3l3RRAB,Simple dinner meal for 2 of Chicken parmy and Kangaroo.  A1.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSal9hZ0VREAE,"The steaks weren't the best, I had better. Also quite pricey. However the staffs were nice, the atmosphere was quite comfortable, well, my table was upstair, not sure downstair to be honest."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDUzZlRREAE,"This was my third visit in the last 6 months but unfortunately this time despite the service being excellent all of the steaks where overcooked, I returned mine with no hassle the second one was on point, but the other 5 people soldiered one and eat theirs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdy15cFBnEAE,"Expected more, felt the presentation of the food very poor, just felt like pub food. Disappointed"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamZLWEtREAE,"Quality, friendly staff, good wine, great food. Get the Ribs!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWR6c3RBRRAB,"We were looking for a good steakhouse to have dinner at and checked Rare Steakhouse based on the reviews. It certainly did not disappoint! The tomahawk was delicious, as was the fillet and kangaroo skewers. Thoroughly enjoyed the oyster shooters and fresh oysters too. Definitely worth checking out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnBuQ213RRAB,"Our dinner was delicious and given the quality of ingredients, it was reasonably priced too. My Porterhouse was cooked beautifully with a nice mashed potato on the side ( I asked for medium rare with black pepper sauce). The highlight was our Greek salad. So fresh and full of flavour. I now find a decent steak restaurant in the CBD that has allowed me to have a great meal without taking up another mortgage. We‚Äôll be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnVhRmt3RRAB,"Our steaks were cooked so well. They source quality ingredients. We enjoyed our entire meal, from our oyster appetisers to our 3 sorbet desert."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXZmcmRREAE,"Warm rustic inviting venue whilst still retaining sofistication, customer service is second to none and of course the food more so was the best I've had from a venue of this size anywhere in the area. Entres were mind-blowing and the steaks had me yearing for more and more, would highly recommend to anyone looking to one of Melbourne's most premium Steak-oriented dining experiences."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHQzUDVBRRAB,"Amazing atmosphere staff were so wonderful and attentive, meals were incredible and came out pretty quickly even though they were so busy. Definitely will be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM1AzRFdnEAE,Food was amazingingly good service staff were friendly and professional.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNkltdnJ3RRAB,Great food & Great Service! Will definitely be back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNElqdUtREAE,"Had a fantastic dinner over here with a colleague. The food was delicious, they had great wine selection, and most importantly the staff were friendly and courteous. It‚Äôs is my second time here and I‚Äôm glad to be back after the covid mayhem. Cheers!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSXzh5a2R3EAE,"First time coming. Nice staff Warm welcome, a very good steak, and reasonable price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeTUyRl9BRRAB,"There are two things I look for in a restaurant: good atmosphere and good food. This place has both. The staff are fantastic, the food is delicious, and the overall experience was amazing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczhheDhnRRAB,"Great food, amazing service.    Well worth the money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOWViQWNBEAE,Absolutely fantastic steak
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGNyT3ZRRRAB,Waited 15 mins for any service.  Finally got a waiter's attention to order a drink.  Beer was flat  & returned.  Waiter spoke/understood very poor English.  Meal served without cutlery.  Finally got waiter's attention for cutlery.  Been going to Rare for over 20 years.  You've done better
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaFl6c2dRRRAB,"Hidden away in an alley, Rare impressed immediately with a humorous welcome from the staff. Delicious food and excellent service. Looking forward to coming back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGVlMkJREAE,"Very nice experience, great food and great service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnFyYm5RRRAB,"Very long wait for our mains. Over 60 minutes. Steak was alright but not sure why at ~$65, you're asked to pay an extra $5 for a sauce."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXZQdDVnRRAB,"Outstanding, staff all very happy! Patrick was a great waiter."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc3FLQmdBRRAB,Had a great time there. Steak was perfectly cooked. Generous and courteous staff. Cool digs too. Lots of price options.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3VyS2x3RRAB,"Steak was beautiful. Chicken was nice but the BBQ sauce that was lathered over it was too sweet and rich. Service was great, but at times slow to bring out drink orders. The espresso Martini was not pleasant. Tasted like coffee and water. Could not taste any alcohol. It was very disapointing fir the $22 price tag."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NVBtVUVBEAE,Came for a late lunch and was not disappointed. Fettuccini carbonara. Also had a coffee: best coffee I‚Äôve had in weeks.  Will be back‚Ä¶.. sorry forgot to take photos‚Ä¶ next time
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0b0xMUWRnEAE,"This is one of my all time favourite Cafe's.  Well run, friendly and on the ball, not expensine, down to earth and not too fancy!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGNtUklREAE,"Our breakfast was good, coffee was great as you'd expect in Medbourne! Service was not the best but realise it was during the busy period of f1. Will return."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUxqMzNRRRAB,"Came in last weekend, ordered the lamb shank and the special pasta both were delicious. Definitely best lamb shank I've had as it just fell off the bone and was such a decent portion too, the mashed potato was perfectly done too most of the time it's too runny or too solid but not this one what ever you guys do please never change it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM19lWkdBEAE,"We‚Äôve been long time very happy customers at Triim, the food is so excellent and consistent every time we dine there, tonight we had the probably the best fish (barramundi) we‚Äôve ever eaten anywhere (so moist and a big piece too!)  The prices are very reasonable for their high quality food, their seafood pasta which we tend to order every time is to die for with the best quality seafood.  It‚Äôs prompted me to leave a positive feedback as this restaurant, it‚Äôs so well deserved from the quality of the food, the reasonable prices and the owners and staff are super-friendly. We love sitting outside in the lane, great atmosphere!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWQ2UXJnRRAB,"Nice place and Great coffee, I love Segafredo!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMFkydGdnRRAB,Veg lasagne was really tasty and reasonably priced at $20. Service attentive. Hardware lane always a good busy vibe
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXZiYzlRRRAB,"Brilliant service, delicious food, great atmosphere. Thanks for finding a space for us. Had our food on the table 20 mins after ordering."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnVIR0RREAE,"We had a retirement lunch for one of our docs today. She is vegan so we ordered  minestrone soup and a wonderful platter of chargrilled seasonal veggies and crunchy garlic bread. It was a feast! YUM! We all highly recommend the freshness, friendly and prompt service.WE SHALL BE BACK!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdkp1TUlBEAE,Pretty nice small restaurant. We have here some breakfast. Everything was tasty!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaEtYd0NnEAE,"Wait staff might not always with smiley face, but they are okay. We tried pastas and it was not bad.  A reasonably priced restaurant and overall a pleasant experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ0k3YzZRRRAB,"Wait staff were great, fitting us in and not rushing us to order. Very knowledgeable about the menu and gave good advice. This was our first visit but won't be our last.  They accommodated our 2 small kids with high chairs and great kids meal options. Very appreciative of the great service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLV9QdW5BRRAB,"Sasha and his wife were very hospitable, lamb shanks were the portion mum would serve and the brunch was served all day. Even better! Hvala Puno Sasha!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTRtRW93RRAB,Waited an hour. Got our food order wrong. The man at the counter was very rude
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN2NLRFZ3EAE,Nice coffee and sensational lemon tart made by the manager! Will look forward to going back for dinner some time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWZibzdnRRAB,"It was fine. If you need breakfast and you want bog standard eggs, museli, bacon etc then it's ok. Not astounding in the value or the taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3JiUlFREAE,"The rudest staff I‚Äôve ever seen and worse service ,we wait for our main meal for more than 40 min and when we tried to find someone to ask everyone just ignored us also they said they close at 9:30 but they started clean up our table at 9 before any prior notice"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob29fYklBEAE,Left before ordering. The rudest waiter ever
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob3JuREF3EAE,"Were at breakfast Flat white is bad - both bitter and watery. Opposite Maker coffee - it's better to drink coffee there Bread for toast in dishes is not very tasty. This is not sourdough, but some kind of toast bread. And that's really bad Well, the employees are very tired already in the morning. No smiles, no kindness. Overall not the worst place, but I would pass by in the future"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoME15MlRnEAE,"Just a simple, tasty breakfast but with extremely quick service.  Not particularly trendy or exciting but good for a nice feed. My chai latte was also delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodl9TX1RREAE,"Excellent food and service. I was very very impressed by their very fragrant seafood pasta, and their delicious lemon tart and tiramisu! I love their seafood pasta and it is easily the best seafood pasta I have eaten in many years...."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajRMcHVnRRAB,"Disappointing. Order the focaccia sandwich, which was more of a bap and a little chewy/stale. Salad was withered. Flat white was bitter. Service was also slow, but granted it was very busy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTZHV3B3RRAB,Last visit 3 years ago!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocFktcEJBEAE,Worst customer service the host was extremely rude and very insensitive ( white oldish man ) my friend was on a fruit diet so she carried her breakfast box with her and she even ordered drinks she simply just asked for a fork and the host just refused and gave her a lecture how she shouldn‚Äôt be eating it I understand it‚Äôs not ideal to bring outside food to a cafe .. but there is a way to talk to people.. he gave her a fork in the end when he saw her crying with a very dirty attitude..!! Very disappointed
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLVpQWjhBRRAB,"It was one of the most memorable solo meals abroad of my life! I was hungry looking at the menu when I was greeted, and had the pasta that was recommended. The service was attentive and very very comfortable. It was perfect, always caring but not annoying.  The pricing is absolutely fair. I think it is not expensive at all if you can enjoy fresh seafood oil pasta in the middle of Melbourne with warmful service, taking into account the inflation in recent years. The lemon tart which chef (I suppose) recommended me was also really good, I'm glad I ordered it :) Thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OElTUTJ3RRAB,Wonderful service and beautiful food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajhxVXB3RRAB,Even the Korean music and food were like Korean pubs. It must be because the Korean chef said that the food tastes the same. I was satisfied with all but one of the more than 10 menus! Korean food on a business trip is love
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ18yd1RnEAE,Good traditional Korea foods Good price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanVfdldnEAE,Amazing huge tonkatsu!! The sauce is really good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDU2Y0VBEAE,"Chicken was grey and smelly , order not same as picture , jst came out still vomiting"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbFlIZUlnEAE,Traditional Korean style restaurant. Good food and good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURneGZfU3RnRRAB,It's really really delicious~~~ A place I think of every day!! I'll have it delivered tomorrow.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScVB1NVlREAE,"Spicy squid salad, Chung-ha korean Sake, spicy pork and calamari stone sizzling! Fresh and delicious, friendly and quick service! Cozy little hide out venue! Seatings available inside and outside with Marquees set up at the front with a summer vibe! Wheel chair access but entrance is on a slope so be careful. Price competitive and servings were generous. Not exactly a peaceful quiet and relaxing venue as the music volume was up high, popular with students and alike!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczRLYjBnRRAB,"Disappointing experience. Food was average and low value for the price. Lots of sugar, no side dishes and no rice included Review rating is misleading I wouldn't recommend this place it should be 3 stars or less"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLVpQQVVBEAE,"Pork cutlet was chewy. The tap beer had red pepper powder floating around, so I replaced it. It's not a neat one."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaEpiaVdnEAE,Ordered the army stew noodles and the garlic soy fried chicken and it was amazing! Staff were also very friendly. I will definitely come back again to this place to try more of their food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoN0tPWWpRRRAB,"Wanted to like it, but have to say that I found it overpriced for its value. They mark up the soju so much! The army stew was pretty decent, but again overpriced and the serving size was actually not enough for two people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNUlIbm1nRRAB,I had  dinner here with a largish group. We had not booked and they were able to accomodate us with no issues. The menu consists of a range of the typical Korean food and come in fairly large servings. Service was pretty quick as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeC1tUkdBEAE,Yummy Korean restaurants.  Worth to visit with friends.  A bit noisy with diners but typical Korean restaurant atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNmRtUXh3RRAB,"The service was extremely fast, we tasted several kinds of fried chicken as well as the beef. Everything was very good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdU5PUTJ3RRAB,"Ordered soy garlic fried chicken and the kimchi cold noodle.  Cold noodle was cold but the noodles were soft and not of the chewy starch type.  Fried chicken wasn‚Äôt piping hot. Could eat straight away without waiting. Wasn‚Äôt crispy under the sauce. Feels like it was pre-fried, reheated slightly and the covered in sauce.  The flavours were ok but much better options for Korean food in the CBD."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLWRqV01BEAE,"The food is delicious! The spicy seafood soup is amazing! The cartilage rice balls and fried chicken are also delicious üëçThe disadvantage is that the alcohol is expensive It‚Äôs good to just eat. If you want to drink with friends, you can go to other cheap places."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMlpQTW1nRRAB,"This restaurant has really yummy food. We ordered chicken in cheese, the cheese was really melted and stretchy. The noodles (I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre called) are really good, as well, a bit greasy though.  The one thing I‚Äôm a bit disappointed about is there are no restrooms. Yes, you heard me, there‚Äôs no restrooms inside the restaurant. They would give you a key tag to go to another building with a hidden restroom behind a big screen. You have to tap the key tag SO MANY times. It was like an endless maze. For the males‚Äô toilets, it was only one tap to get in. For the females‚Äô toilets, it was two taps to get in. It takes a quiet long time to get in, and it‚Äôs not good for the people who really need to go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTdxSkR3EAE,"Unfriendly manager and staff, won't be going again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOEt6RUZBEAE,"Best night, incredible staff!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMmZqUk5BEAE,Not bad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4MWRtaFdREAE,Excellent food matched to Curly Flat's sublime wines.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzdE0td2ZnEAE,"Good food, expensive drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcTlIcUtnEAE,Loved it. Accommodating staff. Great food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNb2NQMk5BEAE,"Match of taste, excellent service, a touch of vintage to the environment"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNa3B6RUVBEAE,"I enjoyed the French Saloon for a business dinner. Some excellent food, including a decent plate of charcuterie and tasty burrata. Steak was particularly good. Kind of French, but didn't feel like being in Paris - more the kind of ""modern European"" where you get a range of cuisines melded......maybe that's a good thing as the menu had a mix of classics (steak tartare, fois gras) and more modern dishes to please all tastes. Extensive and expensive wine list (with a lot of Australian)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNc05UY1lBEAE,"Up a narrow stairwell off bustling hardware lane lies the hidden gem of the Melbourne food and wine scene. Rustic open warehouse  reveals warm and welcoming staff with the food simply being the best I have ever eaten. Honestly it's world class, as is the extensive champagne and wine list. Fine gastronomic treats appear from an upstairs hidden kitchen. There is evident love in creation here and not to be missed. 10 out of 10"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcFpuaFp3EAE,Delicious food in  classic French bistro setting.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwN3JTSThnRRAB,Chef‚Äôs menu was delicious- very reasonably priced and good service. Knowledgeable staff and lots of local produce (cheese & honeycomb) used which was fantastic! Shame they don‚Äôt open for dinners on weekends else I will be a regular diner for sure!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbGF1ZlJREAE,"Incredible food, wine and service. Treat someone special to this spot."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwaU1DSjRBRRAB,Was there for a wedding reception.  Great food & wine. Service was excellent
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dktqbWxBRRAB,"One of my favourite coffee shop in Melbourne, do a proper cup of magic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamV6QWxBRRAB,"Oh my gosh.. it's the best coffee I've ever had in my life. It's life coffee. Melbourne coffee was a bit strong, so it didn't suit me, but here, the bitterness is zero to the point where I wonder if this is coffee. It was delicious from start to finish. I bought coffee beans for a gift, but after drinking a cup of flat white, I asked what beans I ate and bought another house blend coffee beans. Good good, I want to come back to Melbourne because of this place"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWNfVWx3RRAB,dim lighting and calm
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWZEY2lBRRAB,"Beautiful Service, excellent coffee and those cookies are so good. Definitely will be back if I'm in Melbourne again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWE3VkNREAE,Nice coffee. ample seating. busy in office hours.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWFDSHR3RRAB,Great speciality roasted coffee
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGQ2SFFBEAE,Not badüëåI heard that it has been open for 18 years. There are indoor and outdoor seats~ It is comfortable to sit outdoors
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanZhOGRnEAE,Great coffee!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXZuekF3EAE,Absolutely best milky coffee in my life and the cookie is well harmonized with Coffee. Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXNqdklREAE,Lovely staffs and coffee.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeG9MLUZ3EAE,"Great coffee, great meal, enjoyed very much üëçüëç"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkpyb2Z3EAE,Found it Great coffee
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdFByNE1REAE,Great
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeE9QbnVBRRAB,Great coffee and hot chocolate
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNlA0ZhAB,Tried Melbourne‚Äôs infamous Magic coffee and it was SO good here! Espresso was on point and the service was very friendly. It‚Äôs a must try!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc05YYUF3EAE,"Lovely place, amazing coffee"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemJXaUpnEAE,amazing coffeeÔºÅ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeFlDNnpRRRAB,"I had a chai latte without sugar but I add 2 spoon of sugat that is available in the coffee shop, which is really good and tasty. It‚Äôs smell really good with light creamy foam on top and cinnamon powder."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeVpDYTVBRRAB,Best coffee in this part of town
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2ZmWjBBRRAB,Yummy coffee tucked around in a coffee hub of Melbourne CBD. I have heard many good things about this place and I can confirm that the rumours are true!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHZEQkd3EAE,One of the best coffees in the area. Go there every time I work from the city get my daily (sometimes more than 1) caffeine fix.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNTVtNF9nRRAB,"Came here last week, the food was very tasty with a generous portion. Very busy time but service was SUPER quick! Give it a try if you want to find an authentic Chinese restaurant. Love this placeüëç Will be back soon üôèüôè"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemItRUZ3EAE,Juicy but chicken&pork was little bit stiff than prawn or pork only dumplings
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWFyYXJBRRAB,Service was fairly quick and the staff friendly. Ordered Stir fried beef on dry noodle and xiao longbao. The xiaolongbao was good but the noodles almost no flavour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGVUYmtRRRAB,"Used to be good, but now they've become stingy and cheap resulting the dishes to taste so much worse than before (esp. the pork mapo tofu, very watered down and nearly no pork)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmVxV3Z3RRAB,"One word... Dumplisious  Ate wayy too much and regretted nothing, dumplings were amazing and the price was right"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM29FXxAB,Fulfilling food with good price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbVBPbFFREAE,Good dumplings
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd05EZGVnEAE,"One of the best, I recommend the pork & mushroom wonton soup. Opt for steamed dumplings over fried here as they can be a little bit tough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHN2REVnEAE,"I ordered fresh fried shrimp, squirrel sea bass and salmon fried rice, none of them were deliciousü´†"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWZIb1h3EAE,Been wanting to go here for a long time. Service was fairly quick even though they were busy but I was still let down hard. Had the chicken prawn long bao and kung Poa chicken dumplings. Both the fillings had this denseness to them and it felt more like chewing through rubber. There was nothing about the flavour that was nice or fresh and the kung poa chicken dumpling tasted sweet for some reason.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnJ6SGRBEAE,"Great food, ok price, fine service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenY2OXN3RRAB,Very nice xiao long bao and hot-and-sour soup here!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHZmcXF3RRAB,Dumplings to die 4. Absolutely fresh and tasty.  A good amount of chilly with the peanut satay
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHFYVEh3EAE,wait forever
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN0tQNkhBEAE,Amazing and real Chinese food! Super quick
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVBQNDNRRRAB,Too Loud but good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc09ybU1BEAE,"Average, Xiao Long Bao is ok, but not the best. There is more than enough than the top and more than the bottom."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoXy1GThAB,A great place for us to meet after work for some cheap eats.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOS1mWUxBEAE,"Mapo Tofu Rice and Wonton Noodle Soup!!!! Please eat Probably the best Chinese food in Melbourne. And if you ask for jasmine tea, they give it to you, so be sure to ask for it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoelpPeWJREAE,Peanut chilli dumpling to die for!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGJxaTh3RRAB,Highly recommend this place. Perfect food. Fantastic service and all at a reasonable price. Definitely go here for a meal or two.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWZ6ekFnEAE,Great dumplings
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWJybS1nRRAB,Really good dumplings and mains
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaWFmc0ZnEAE,Very good dumplings quick service and reasonable price. I will go back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4a01LSHFnRRAB,"Great place for a coffee, friendly service, nice big cup of coffee, music very enjoyable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXJEdFFREAE,Great customer service despite them being so busy. Friendly staff
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3VQMXVBRRAB,Was ok. Service not the best. Coffee good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdFlXdGJREAE,"I  dont know how, but they made chilli crab for breakfast work. Take it with magic while enjoying the view and people-watching in Bourke St."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWNMMzhnRRAB,"Avo stack was pretty good, but the toast was a bit average. Coffee was good Staff friendly and the table was clean."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMVBpVlp3EAE,Delicious foods in good location üòã
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTV6WExREAE,"they were nice enough, but charging a ‚Äúsunday surcharge‚Äù on a saturday (not a public holiday) and claiming it as a ‚Äúweekend surcharge‚Äù is unacceptable"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmJqRXVnRRAB,"""Best breakfast I've ever had"" - my 8 year old daughter (picky eater). Great service, great coffee, great hot chocolate and superb French Toast. Would give 6 stars if it were possible!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMFpENEVBEAE,The coffee is delicious and the location is good. The staff are all friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoenZmOGVBEAE,Nice coffee and convenient location
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobU1LSUVBEAE,"This place used to be great, Now staff have changed, bad customer sevice and it's dirty and the food was not great as before."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodWJlQk93EAE,Great service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocHVmVE1BEAE,"I wish someone had told me about this place sooner. I've been wandering Melbourne for daaays looking for a brekky joint that's open, affordable, and delicious... and it was here the whole time. Thank you for saving me this morning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodk1qNHFnRRAB,Great coffee and great service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMTdxTkd3EAE,"Great coffee, lovely staff, best location."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdGQtejFRRRAB,"Consistently good quality coffee, nice atmosphere, wonderful service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCODRULXl3RRAB,"This place used to be great, a treasure in the cbd. Now the owner has changed and it's dirty and the food, not great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM2JqaFp3EAE,Best coffee in Melbourne.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaWZlZElnEAE,"An uninspiring breakfast which took half an hour to come out, after being forced to order on their mobile app menu. I also had to send my food back once since you can‚Äôt leave notes in the order"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeWVpbklREAE,Used to love this place but last 2 visits are the last straw. I think the owner has changed because the people and menu has changed and it's pretty bad. No more shakshuka. Burnt toast. Just plain bad. It used to be pricey but good. Now just overpriced. Won't last long
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNFluQk9BEAE,Man knows how to make a 4 shot almond coffee.  Perfect
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbHJTRVNnEAE,$5 for a small coffee and that was served cold....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMnJHTnFRRRAB,Smashed avo and Cappuccino. Avocado was bruised and tasted well past its prime. Roast tomatoes cold and flavourless. Coffee just ok
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaElLRTZBRRAB,Amazing customer service displayed today. Was provided a free coffee and mimosa after dropping mine wt Brunch. Will definitely be returning!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLUtMNlN3EAE,"Be prepare to be garbed in bib, gloves, wielding a wooden hammer, this is a fun and messy meal. The yabbys are juicy and delicious in the spicy sauce, with a side of corn and rice to sop up the juices. We were lucky to enjoy the special, Crawfish, which were succulent and cooked to perfection. The prawns were a little dry, perhaps cooked for the same length of time as the other crustaceans but we will certainly be back again to try the sliders and cocktails. Service is ever so friendly and efficient, just remember to ask for cutlery should you need a spoon for the rice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzem9yTjJRRRAB,"Unfortunately I did not have a good experience at Grab a yabby,my wife ordered a crab,when it was brought to the table my wife found a long hair embedded in the crab. We informed the waitress of this,instead of resolving the issue right on the spot she informed us that she had to contact her boss to get a result,after waiting for 15 minutes she came back and said that it wasn't any of the chefs,s the waitress insinuated that the hair must've come from my wife. I found that very insulting towards my wife,the owner of the restaurant should have a good hard look at his/her staff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbXRXb3R3RRAB,"terrible service ! my friend pulled out a long hair from the alaska crab legs. she showed that to waitress. then waitress returned and told her all the waitresses serve outside not nearby kitchen, and their chef has short hair :) well, my friend has long hair but tied up, feel like they consult that hair belongs to my friend. very irresponsible. check the cctv then you will see where the hair comes from! wont ever come back there again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbXU2YkpnEAE,"Bad service with food was not delicious and a bit pricing. We found a long hair stick around crab foot. We told them about the hair. 20 mins later, they told us :"" all the chef had short hair and they wear hair net. You was nearly finished the dishes so we will give you 15% discount of that dish, the one with hair inside."" ... they mean the hair belong to us. It s our fault !!! It s such a very very bad services !!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNb29IU2FnEAE,All day breakfast was ok but little bit pricy. The service was good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcWRUWFFBEAE,"This place was a hidden gem when I stumbled upon this place. Coming in late, they told me when the kitchen closed and when I asked if ordering the rib was reasonable. They said it was no problem and told me to come in. It was a small restaurant no more than 50 seats capacity inside. I ordered the rib and was told I had to wait 20 mins. Ordering the rib 20 min wait time was very reasonable so I patiently waited and it was very worth the wait. Rib‚Äôs sauce was perfect as well as the amount of meat on the rib was good. Service was very excellent and very attentive. Came back 2 days later with my friend and ordered a yabby and a lobster linguini and it was so good. The sauce with the yabby was very tasty and it went very well with the rice it came along with it. Once I come back to Melbourne. Im sure this is one of the place I will be looking forward to come back to"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNmRmM21BRRAB,"Meat is dry and bland, most likely due to being cooked twice. Mild is Spicy, obviously they need a mild option that is actually mild. Everything is overpriced for what it is. A VB is $9 and a Peroni/asahi is the same price. Wouldn‚Äôt visit twice"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbnNMbGZnEAE,"King Crab, mussels and lobster tail were delicious- the singaporian sauce (which is not on the menu) is to die for! We ordered it in mild and it was perfectly spiced and we dipped up every little bit of it! Don't be fooled by the red plastic table cloth when walking in. Staff were super friendly and informative, looked after us with exceptional service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcVpmZkhBEAE,"*No Yabbies for the 2nd time. *No Oysters: Oysters are to be ordered (over the phone with your booking) a few days in advanced so they can run down to Safeway and get them for you. *Premium price for frozen Bay Bugs - sigh *No Crabs in stock, but they have chicken!  Don't waste your time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMDhfSEJ3EAE,"Totally unexpected down to earth great seafood dining experience. It is back to basics approach: 1 - Fresh and good seafood, 2 - Totally tasty sauces and 3 - Turn up the spice heat. We had Prawns in XO, Marrons in Singapore Chilli and Clams Sphaghetti. There were delicious.  The only reason for not giving five star is the excessive use of plastics - plastic table cloth, plastic bibs and plastic gloves. Surely we can clean our hands under a tap."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0LWJDM0N3EAE,"We had 1 crab leg, 1 tiny yabby and 5 pippies each with a soft drink...$50 pp..I‚Äôm all about spending money on food, but seafood wasn‚Äôt fresh, they tried to cover up how low quality the seafood is with sauce (no option to have it plain as seafood ISNT FRESH). Garlic sauce is terrible and taste like old oil. Don‚Äôt want to sound mean, but one of the worst restaurants that I‚Äôve eaten at. Not to mention the amount of money you pay and get charged for a lemon wedge to eat with your seafood. Definitely do not recommend unless you‚Äôre happy to throw your money away"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdjd6Y2xnRRAB,Once fresh food and good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZcTUzRTVBRRAB,What an atrocious dining experience. I ordered the lobster pasta and it was clearly unfresh. Both lobster and pasta was overcooked and had no flavour. Lobster texture was rubbery and I still have a sickly aftertaste from it an hour later.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZeTlUX2x3RRAB,Pretty good food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNGN1djRBRRAB,"The waiters were nice, i tried the Australian shrimp, it was good, the amount was not to much compared with the price"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvNC1TWXVBRRAB,Great food and service .Thanks you so much
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdDRMckhBEAE,Food was good.. Not amazing but good. First time i have had yabby. I give it a 3 because it was ridiculously over priced!! I could of bought 10 times the amount of seafood from springvale and cooked it myself for what we paid. Service was friendly :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvZzUyRWp3RRAB,"Best food, Best experience! Staff are all super friendly and the food is just amazing! Have visited once and will definitely be back. Don‚Äôt be scared to get messy, make sure to dip the crab meat in whatever sauce you got - it is like seafood heaven in your mouth!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOWEySHdBRRAB,"Fun and new experience.  Eat and play coming together. Don't be afraid to get messy.  My honest review is everything that we order was extremely delicious. Customer service is exceptional, informative and consistence.  Obviously with all seafood unless frozen are expensive (to each their own). As someone who eats regularly at home and dines here and there, this is definitely a higher end for the average Joe. But then again, it depends on how big of an appetite you have. I will say a dinner for two here including two wines cost me roughly $120. You can see from my previous reviews that we spend roughly $30-$60 for a dinner for two. This is 2-4 times more than the usual. But it was a celebration dinner nonetheless.  The seafood you can definitely tell is fresh.  They even provide wet wipes after you're finished !!  I would definitely recommend this to someone with a desire for fresh seafood.  I am definitely coming here again !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ckxTY1J3EAE,Food quality is amazing and super fun design when served. Cocktails are delicious as well. The overall atmosphere is such a cute vibe. Perfect location for a girls day night and brunch.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dU1pblhBEAE,Food and service was just ok PINK restaurant is really very pink. üôÇüôÇüôÇ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0p1VkNREAE,"This is the worst restaurant I‚Äôve ever eaten in. I wish I could give it zero stars. We went for a friends birthday on the weekend and had to choose from a set menu which has 3 entree options and 2 main options. The entrees all arrived cold and staggered, the calamari was just two frozen calamari rings cut into small pieces. The mains were a vegetable tempeh curry or ribs and Asian green vegetables. The curry had what looked like roast vegetables in there and didn‚Äôt have the tempeh, nor did it come served with rice. The ribs were just over cooked hunks of fatty meat that couldn‚Äôt be cut, smelled awful kind of like liquorice, and the meal was served without and vegetables. They also missed an order in our group so we were short an entree and a main. While we were there someone was renting the space upstairs for an event and had come down 4 times to complain about the service and food. No one could eat the mains, they were inedible and we sent them back. When it came to paying the guy serving us wouldn‚Äôt have a bar and we all had to argue about the service and the quality of the food to even get a lousy discount, he wouldn‚Äôt let us just pay for drinks only, which was all any of us had. Despite only having one cocktail and not eating any food I was still charged $40. Don‚Äôt ever go here, it‚Äôs horrific. Nothing came at the same time and the food was such low quality, matches the decor of the interior."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjhQMTNnRRAB,Terrible and rude customer service. Outdated website. Waste of time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScjctaVNREAE,"1 bartender serving 30+ people cocktails then disappearing, food taking forever to come out & not enough for everyone, too slow clearing plates very disappointing for the money spent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnZENElBEAE,"Our visit at this restaurant to say the least is very underwhelming. Yes the decor is fun and cute but apart from that, everything else did not hit the mark. We were greeted by I‚Äôm assuming the manager with the least accommodating vibe and when it was time to order, we were asking the staff member for some recommendations on the menu since you would assume they‚Äôd know what is good. It‚Äôs quite a surprise to me when the staff member herself said ‚Äúumm‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt know cause I don‚Äôt like the food here.‚Äù Although that was already a bit disappointing we still gave the restaurant a chance. The cocktails tasted nice but the food was definitely not worth the price. The tacos were smaller than the size of my hand and the beans were really tough so I‚Äôm assuming it wasn‚Äôt even cooked and there was very minimal meat in the dish. This place could use some improvement."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnRTeWtBRRAB,Cute pink place. Staff attentive and friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScm9pYV9nRRAB,"Pretty setting, very small servings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEtpLTlnRRAB,"don‚Äôt bother. The aesthetics of this place are nice, but you can get better pics in a random ally way tbh.  The food : we got a bowl of chips and calamari. The chips were COLD and soggy after waiting 40 min for it. The calamari wasn‚Äôt even cooked and Fridge cold (it‚Äôs still swimming as we speak).  Also I forgot that I wasn‚Äôt at Karen‚Äôs diner :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeE1pdy1RRRAB,"Great pink aesthetic but shocking service and food. Proportions were small for price, cold and stale. Even drinks weren‚Äôt made properly whether they‚Äôre were cocktails or coffee. The coffees had white particles in them."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaEszY0dREAE,"The place it‚Äôs nice, different from other place‚Ä¶ the cocktail are very cool but the menu it‚Äôs really poor‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobThTeXBnRRAB,"The first time I came here it was nice, but the last time I visited it was not a good experience. The staff are nice and the decorations are cute, however, the food, although pretty, is very average and overpriced for what it is. There were only two tables eating in, and the staff just stood around talking; it took an incredibly long time to be served and then for our food to actually be made. There was no communication from the staff about when the kitchen closes, meaning my younger sister missed out on dessert, which she was most excited for. I don‚Äôt normally like to leave negative reviews, however my mum and sister were very excited to visit here, but ended up having a disappointing night."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeU1MNlpBEAE,Nope.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWRXTEtREAE,"I visited this restaurant excited about the pink decor and a delicious menu. My excitement soon disappeared as I was greeted by a surly waitress who I distracted from folding napkins. The place was fairly quiet, yet I waited over 10 minutes to have my order taken. The food was average and took far too long to be served. Unfortunately for the whole girl power theme, the female staff are unfriendly at best (and completely unattentive). A shame, as the novel restaurant concept could have been a lovely experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGJmdGxRRRAB,"Service and food delivery was very slow, made up by the atmosphere, decor and company. Fast alcohol delivery"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXZpRUxBEAE,"This place is absolutely abysmal as a restaurant. We had an awful experience here a few weeks ago. We book a table for 12 for a friends birthday and it took 2 hours for us to receive our meals. Despite us flagging down the waitress several times and asking we were unable to get a second round of drinks. The meals were sub par at best, as we were a large group we had to order of a specific menu. The tofu started was dry and tasteless with no greens at all. The beef main was mostly fat and had no rice or greens, just the meat. There were not dessert options at all. When we left they would not offer us a discount at all dispute the terrible service, terrible food and the time it took. In fact they ended up double charging me and after I call they and the manager said they would refund me, they have not. The venue was much older and dirtier than we expected, the foam mirrors in the bathroom were broken, flowers were missing from the flower wall, pictures on the pictures on the walls were ripped."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXJpbDNBRRAB,"HOW HAS THIS PLACE NOT BEEN SHUT DOWN? This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I was given a specific menu that I had to order one entre, one main, and one cocktail from. For the entree and main there is only 2 or 3 options, the cocktail list seemed better but - the restaurant never bought me my cocktail. I ordered it with the waiter and then flagged down the staff and asked where my drink was 4 seperate times, and after 2 hours I gave up. The entree was gross and the main was inedible. Literally the worst dining experience of my life. When it was time to pay the bill I explained that I never received my cocktail that I paid for, and asked for a refund. I was denied. What an actual joke this place is."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeUtTSGxBRRAB,"Went to Pink the Restaurant last Sunday for my friends birthday and we had the WORST experience! We were booked in for the 2 hour bottomless brunch and not only did they not have anything on the menu avaliable at peak time on the weekend, they also didn‚Äôt serve us our first drinks until an hour in. The cocktail jugs and food were different to the descriptions on the menu and we had to ask for extra food when they brought out our ‚Äòmains‚Äô as entree sizes cause they didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients. Free flowing prosecco was also part of the bottomless deal which took 30 minutes from ordering to be brought to the table. Aside from this the staff were useless and seemed to not know what was going on or just standing around. We left hungry, thirsty and disappointed. Do not go here, it‚Äôs a scam decorated in pink."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa083Zmh3RRAB,"My friend and I were visiting from Adelaide and decided to book for dinner here on a Friday night. We even received email confirmation of our booking. However when we turned up to the adjoining pizza bar, we were told Pink is no longer open on Fridays. We understand that opening days/hours can change, however, we were not notified of this change and that our booking would be cancelled. It wasn‚Äôt even posted on Pink‚Äôs social media. We were quite disappointed and had to wander the city in search of somewhere else for dinner.  In saying this, we decided to give them a go on Sunday and enjoyed a cocktail each. The decor was lovely, very pink! And our cocktails were quite nice. To make up for Friday‚Äôs inconvenience, the staff member did not make us pay for our drinks, which was lovely of him."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodjhmY3BnRRAB,Not overly happy. My first and second choices were both unavailable. Ended up ordering avo toast and very disappointing considering the price. The eggs were cold and the toast was just basic bread. Don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth‚Äù $23 (plus the Sunday 10% surcharge).  The service was also very very slow. Waited 30 minutes alone for the 1 mocktail.  The venue itself is cute but that‚Äôs about it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMzVXaTd3RRAB,"As a lover of all things pink, this place was a magenta filled disappointment. My partner and I came with the intention of enjoying a few drinks ahead of a midday theatre show, but after waiting for over 30 minutes for a glass of bubbles, our experience was quickly soured. We watched patiently as the table beside us got served their food before any drinks. I swear I could hear the cocktail filled tray sitting on the bar calling out for someone to pick it up and get it to the thirsty patrons' lips. A mum and daughter at a table behind us had their dream of filling their bellies with pink flavoured fare shattered when it arrived at their table cold and messy. With no sign of wine in sight, we stepped away from our rose coloured seats. I walked my fresh pink bob swiftly out of the door and vow never to return again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaDZMUS1nRRAB,"As a lover of pink üíó and flowers üå∏ this restaurant was my complete vibe. The interior of this restaurant is so pretty and love that they have cute pink cocktails. They also have a flower wall and when you head upstairs you will see the ‚Äúpink vibes only‚Äù area.  The menu also has the cutest names and play on words. We had pork boa buns, braised lamb with lentils, calamari choy bow and yellow vegetable curry with roti and rice. All dishes were flawless and packed full of flavour.  Definitely give them a visit and consider this restaurant for a girls night out!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoODhtM0NnEAE,"NOT WORTH IT!! Visited this place with a group of 12 for a friends birthday. We were told we had to have the set menu at $65pp which was okay with us. We arrived at 6pm ordered food by 6:20pm. Entrees came out reasonable, none of the wait staff checked back to see if the food was okay or if we wanted more drinks. Two guests ended up waiting 40 mins for a mocktail each. By 7:50pm we had still not received any of our main meals and one of our guests had to leave. I informed the wait staff that we hadn‚Äôt received our mains or any other drinks and she just huffed at me and sighed. In the end about 8:30pm mains arrived and they were average to say the least. When paying for the bill the wait staff insisted the guest that left did not pay (which she most definitely did as she paid only for entree and drink rather than $65) and added an extra charge onto the main guests card - charging for an extra two people. Overall the experience was beyond average. The place is pink yes and maybe good for photos but nothing else. You also have to walk through a dingy pizza place, out the back and up the stairs.  Would NOT recommend and will not be going back ever!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmFqN1dBEAE,"If you like eating at a place where the overpriced dish looks like a pile of scraps, the drink taste like cough medicine, accompanied by dead flies and dirty decors, this is your place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMGR6WEZREAE,Really great food and perfect table service! Love the brownies and ice cream! The watermelon cocktail was really good as well
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXJYbVlREAE,"Nice egg benedict, although the sourdough was a bit hard to chew."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHRpeXBnRRAB,Pizza isn‚Äôt the best. Same standard as a store bought pizza base
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3UzeUVREAE,Delicious large size pizza for an affordable price range.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd19hdnNRRRAB,"Yesterday we had a large pizza. The guy told that we can have 2 choices so we had meatlovers and Hawaiian. Both were great, tasty, with loads of toppings."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSME1hMkR3EAE,Pasta is bad. I had the veggie one - so clumpy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNzRLd3ZBRRAB,GOATED PIZZA SLICE RESTAURANT
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMjdpSlVnEAE,"High quality pizza slices that have a range to choose from depending on your dietary needs. I always stuck with the classic Hawaii & meat lovers as the price you can snag a slice for was amazing.  The staff are friendly and the aroma of freshly cooked pizza, makes the senses crave it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodWZYWTF3RRAB,"Poor experience. Expensive and not a pizza I can recommend. 5 star ""reviews"" from local guides are paid reviews by the way. Avoid the place and the owner"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa1pQRlR3EAE,Pizza for people who don't know what a real pizza looks like. Sad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX09ud1hBEAE,"Top notch pizza, cool atmosphere, good music, no frills late night tucker. Always true to their slogan, Get sliced, ya dog!  Top stuff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodEl6Z2F3EAE,I got this pizza on Saturday afternoon Literally the best pizza i‚Äôve ever had in Melbourne. Hate that it took me so long to try one from here but I‚Äôm going here everytime i crave pizza. chefs kiss üòôü§åüèΩ
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeFBTSkdREAE,One of the best pizza ever!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLVlYbnZ3RRAB,Super cheap quick pizza and pasta. Pizza is delicious but pasta is so so. Definitely grab a slice of pizza
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNllQSFN3EAE,I ordered a slice of pizza Margherita on both Rozzi places on Swanson Street.  The pizza üçï slices were still warm and tasty! Highly recommend Rossi's if you like pizza. Prices are relatively good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdmVHZFFBEAE,"possibly the best pizza i‚Äôve ever had at 11pm, i cried the first time i took a bite out of this angelic slice of pepperoni pizza. reminds me of when i was a young boy, in the streets of rome (italy) (the boot shaped country) and i had a real pizza. i wish it was open right now‚Ä¶ (it‚Äôs 12:50am)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMUplRmtRRRAB,"Very bad, because I bought one slice of pizza which priced only 5 dollars, but they charged me 6.5, that‚Äôs why they put there machine so high, people won‚Äôt be able to see how much they charged. That‚Äôs illegal! Greedy people!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOExIQktnEAE,F‚Äôn incredible pizza. So different. So spot on. Try the sweet chilli chicken.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOWRyOGN3EAE,Great pizza
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtX1BiNXZRRRAB,"Service is very fast and efficient, which is very handy for on the go slices. Though I will say $5 for a slice is quite expensive. I would like to see some gluten free options!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN0xDRS1RRRAB,Fantastic pizza ...plenty of topping couldn't fault it üëç
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk1LZld3EAE,Had a great night at ARU!!! Food n service was perfect. Thanks
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkxEanRnRRAB,"Food was incredible - we ordered the pate en croute, duck sausage sanga and clay pot rice. It was a shame we felt rushed the whole time. As soon as the mains were served, the waiter asked if we wanted dessert. Understand we had a two hour seating but we had at least 45 mins to go for our booking and constantly being asked if we wanted dessert and all the friendly reminders that we only had our table till 8 (when it was meant to be 8:15) really ruined the experience for a high end restaurant"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUpheDFRRRAB,Decent food & service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0x1MjJnRRAB,Delicious food and lovely service with a gorgeous venue
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDczR3JBRRAB,What makes Melbourne a great dining destination and culinary epic centre
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDZDamF3EAE,"The restaurant is fine. I found the food to be underwhelming and overly hyped. For how the menu and staff presented the food, I expected something exceptional. For example, I've had much better broken rice meals, which wasn't even prepared in a fine dining setting. Same applies to the salmon dish, duck sanga and scallops. I genuinely think the restaurant and its staff have the capacity to deliver much better food that represents its fine dining stature."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNl9qRGhnRRAB,Everything we had here is way too good & the dry aged duck is mind blowing! Very obsessed with them.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVpDdTRBRRAB,"Loved everything about this experience. The intensity of the flavours imparted in the dishes is mind blowing. The oyster left such a lovely savoury, lingering flavour. It was my favourite. The presentation of all the dishes was perfect. We sat at the bar and I really enjoyed watching the preparation of the food with my partner. I probably wouldn‚Äôt order the chicken again as the flavours accompanying the chicken were a bit too intense (salty?) and probably should have had something bland (like white rice) to subdue it. Plus the duck has amazing reviews so I can‚Äôt wait to come back and try it, along with many other dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVpIa2VBEAE,"Was looking forward to writing a positive review, however the delicious food was ruined by arrogant service. The maitre d unfortunately ruined the whole evening with his sassy attitude and lack of understanding of what customer service is.  However, the warmed oysters and and clay pot broken rice were delicious. Don't recommend the duck sausage as you can't tell the difference between that and a Bunnings sausage! Recommend not sitting at a high table as they have been designed for giants. It's a shame when good food from skillful chefs, who put on a masterclass show in the open kitchen, have their hardwork ruined by average wait staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnJlamF3EAE,Everything was just superbüëå
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHRhUjRnRRAB,Duck and pate en croute show-stopping good as usual.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHByNVh3EAE,Instantly became one of my top fancy dining experience in Melbourne. The Asian Australian fusion provides a great range and shows a very modern and local take on Asian dining. The wine list is also pretty good as well as an interesting cocktail menu. Will come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb29LcVdBEAE,"Overall a great experience. Great ambience and nice service too. Great selection of drinks list too. These were the standouts! - Dry aged duck - Claypot rice again - duck sausage - Kaya waffles  The entrees and small plates - scallop, raw wagyu, bone marrow, bahn mi were alright. Some dishes were very salty though especially the bone marrow and bahn mi (especially the soy bean jelly in it)  The papaya salad would‚Äôve been nicer if it had more of the Thai flavour, more tangy and less mint.  Overall I was satisfied, and would go back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd28zNVpBEAE,"Aru lived up to it's accolades and is now one of our favourite restaurants in Melbourne. Asian fusion food, delicately prepared that showcases fresh local ingredients and flavours. The sourdough bread is amazing (we would buy a whole loaf if we could). The warmed oysters were beautiful, as was the raw beef on betel leaf with marrow. We couldn't resist ordering the 2 rice dishes - claypot and fried rice. Both were excellent! The pipis (special on the day) were beautiful too. Kaya waffle was ü§§ with the tang of raspberry cutting through. Scorched pavlova wasn't overly sweet and was so light. Wattleseed cake was like an elevated spice cake. We can't fault Aru and can't wait to be back!  Wait staff were so attentive and helpful!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSek9hYjdnRRAB,Awesome birthday dinner
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEliVW9nRRAB,Excellent duck. Heavily Asian influenced dishes and all full packed with flavors
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE53RhAB,"incredible experience at Aru, would highly recommend. outstanding service, impressive wine selection & food that'll wow your socks off."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE96LU9nEAE,"Everything was amazing. Listen to the wait staff, every recommendation was bang on, the only misstep of the night was when we didn't listen to them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNS02WTJBRRAB,Brilliant on all levels ... except not cheap
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDVTdVBnEAE,"Absolutely stunning menu, the food was to die for, the customer service was fantastic and the atmosphere was great. Simply can't go wrong üëå"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd19IeEZnEAE,"The staff are very attentive and great at what they do. Highly recommend the duck dish, great tasting and cooked to perfection. The noodles was a close second. No need to order the fried rice, crab meat didn‚Äôt really make the dish any nicer. Had 2x tapas, a small plate, a large plate, a noodle, a rice and two cocktails for $300."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N0tDSndRRRAB,"Pasta texture is absolutely criminal. It tastes old, microwaved, and the biting into it feels like biting into wet toilet paper. I prefer canned spaghetti from Coles. At least the garlic bread was crispy but I would rather eat wood than that pasta again. I only finished it because I am 6 ft but weigh less than 70kg so I will eat anything that has any form of protein in it. Feeling burned as I spent 34 dollars altogether. You have been warned. Avoid at all costs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjlDS1ZREAE,"I ordered the meat pomodoro. Could not finish my food. Pasta was overcooked, strands were clumped together as if the pasta had been sitting there for a while. Pasta sauce was okay. Meatballs were great though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmItX0dREAE,"Had lunch here, decor was nice. Pesto pizza was burnt on the bottom and the tomato was the best part, too bad there was 4 small slices on the entire pizza. Without the tomato it was well over powering flavour.  Had the beef cheek ragu. Beef was well over cooked and very watery. Pasta was doughy and chewy. Aldi frozen ragu is honestly better.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. One staff member was nice, the other wants to dispatch your food, mumble something and get out quick smart."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGVTZXd3RRAB,"Don‚Äôt come here. There are so many amazing Italian pasta and pizza restaurants in Melbourne and this is definitely not one of them. We had the meatballs and bruschetta for starters and beef cheek Ragu and chicken Alfredo for mains. I had the home made lemonade and my partner had Coke Zero.  Every dish was bland. The meatballs were terrible and the bruschetta smelled awful. The pasta dishes were not good, everything tasted like it had just been microwaved or pre made days in advance and frozen.  Unfortunate because the restaurant itself seems inviting and cosy. Very disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWMya2pBRRAB,I have pasta and was so bad. Pasta was undercooked. Not recommended to go there...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHVqanFnRRAB,"Great service, delicious food with amazing cocktails .."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOUpyUE13EAE,"The pasta was under cooked, plus the system was down from ordering from the code in the table, i didn't ask for the drinks while waiting 25mins, they wouldn't of known about not receiving the order."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFB2RzNBRRAB,"The place is quite big but it wasn't busy at all when were there. Food was good, nothing special or distinct but just as expected."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjZMYUR3EAE,"Amazing food, atmosphere. Lovely staff! Highly reccomend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajRpRjhnRRAB,"Very nice tasting bacon and pulled chicken Pizza for a decent price of $26!  The service was good as well. The only thing I dislike is ordering through a QR Code, prefer old school menus, could offer this on walk in?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNV96U2dRRRAB,"Garlic bread was served cold. 1 main served with the garlic bread, other main 10 mins later. Not great flavours. Nice looking restaurant and bar area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDV1OWxRRRAB,"Lacked atmosphere, no music, very quiet, and staff didn't really interact. The food was not very good. I ordered the ragu, which was barely warm with the sauce being very mushy with not much 'sauciness' about it. The pasta was also overcooked and very gelatinous/ claggy, which was not very enjoyable at all. I paid extra and added cherry tomatoes, thinking they'd be cooked in the sauce, but I was wrong. There were just 4 cold, raw tomatoes dumped in the bowl. My husband ordered the prawn pasta dish, and this only had 5 prawns with not much sauce, and the pasta was again overcooked. We ordered through the app at the table, and my scotch and dry came out as a scotch and coke, which was swapped over quickly but shouldn't have needed to be if the order was read correctly. It was very quiet in the restaurant, and the bartender had plenty of time. We will not be returning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTZqaExBEAE,"Long time lover of vapianos but unfortunately this experience was very bad. We ordered at the bar and didn‚Äôt receive drinks until our starters arrived (knew there was a wait but a long time for 2 lemonade, 1 wine and a pre-made frozen margarita) then our starters were almost delivered to the wrong table. Garlic pizza and salad were really good, however the bruschetta was one small piece of bread cut in half - very abysmal - the servings are usually much bigger. The tomato was so soggy and old, ate the bread as we were hungry. The real disappointment were the three pastas we ordered as mains, inedible. Spaghetti was so over cooked it was like glue. Staff only gave the option to have food recooked, have some drinks or an option of a $25 voucher for $90 worth of food that we couldn‚Äôt eat. Not even an apology and told that no one else had complained. had to push for a refund on the pastas as we just wanted leave at that point  Used to be a favourite of mine for an easy Italian dinner, I won‚Äôt be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczV2Ql9BRRAB,Great Italian food and cocktails in a funky lounge setting. Try and grab a comfy booth by the back if you can.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDkyOFhREAE,"Visiting from Sydney I was expecting Melbourne to deliver on its high reputation for its Italian cuisine. Sadly Vapiano provided a poor culinary experience when it came to my pasta dish. I had spaghetti Bolognese. The pasta was well overcooked and gluggy and the sauce was thin, not rich and tasted more like a cheap Woolworths brand microwave dinner. It was easter long weekend and they seemed understaffed and sadly it took over 1 hour to receive the meal which is also overpriced for a microwave tasting meal.  Sorry Vapiano, but overall a seriously bad experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDRhMTR3RRAB,My partner‚Äôs food arrived after I had finished mine. Disappointing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzRYSWdBRRAB,"I haven't eaten such terrible food in a long time. It wasn't just the food that was terrible. We ordered Crema Di Funghi, Bolognese, Arbos Chianti Tuscany Italy. The wine was brought in half an hour later. The volume and quality did not match at all. The food was delivered within an hour. The crema di funghi pasta was overcooked, there were so few mushrooms that the taste was not felt at all. And most importantly, that sauce was terrible. Most likely starch was used to thicken the sauce. There was no creamy taste. There was a feeling that you were eating a digestive paste with glue. The bolognese was also terrible. There was almost no meat, the sauce was disgusting. I really regret wasting my money and time. Plus discomfort in the stomach, although I ate no more than a quarter of this dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdmJQOVJBEAE,"We had lunch here while in the city for the day, amazing food and lovely big restaurant and bar, wasn't to busy while we were there fortunately. Only critique would be they don't accept cash which we had at the time, disappointed about thatüòß I don't like when you don't get the choice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWJ6Y19RRRAB,"Food ok, no service, do it yourself by QR code which had the nerve to ask for a tip ??. For someone to drop a plate on your table and walk off. Missed one meal which to 15-30min to sort after everyone else had there meals"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWVtNl9RRRAB,"First time trying this place on Sunday and was thoroughly disappointed! Firstly, the group I came with made a reservation and yet when we showed-up, there was no table reserved for us and we had to sit on bar stools as all the booths and window seats were taken. Can I ask what is the point of booking then? When we eventually did find a table, no one told us where to get water for the table or how anything worked, the wait staff couldn‚Äôt have cared less.  Secondly, we waited close to 45mins for our food to be brought out to the table, only to take a bite into undercooked pasta in a lukewarm sauce. The wait staff didn‚Äôt check-up on us at all so I had to chase down someone to send my food back. The waiter did not apologise for the undercooked pasta and if anything seemed annoyed that I created extra work for her. My food was clearly thrown in a microwave and the sauce ended-up becoming runny and tasteless, but at least the pasta was cooked (lol).  The place has potential, but has a long way to go before I would consider coming back. Such a disappointing experience, and does not compare to the Flinders Lane store. Oh and the escalator is still broken too, might want to fix that‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaWEzazRRRRAB,Average food and poor service. Go elsewhere
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnZ2T0ZBEAE,Pizza was alright. Pasta was terrible. Managed to be greasy and dry at the same time. Took ages even though the dining hall was half empty.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXZIR2tBRRAB,"staff were mid, food was mid, undercooked, not worth the price. took them 10 mins to take another coke out for the table, there were 4 of us and one of us would always be left out. no service, atmosphere was pretty cute but thats all it offered"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N0lmWTFRRRAB,Bar tender flipped off pater

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHVyaUlnEAE,"I came on Saturday night and it was going off however the lady DJ made me feel so small. I requested 10 songs to be played as it was my 20th birthday and she only played 5. She then went on to tell me she is not my personal juke box and to go elsewhere. The security also told me to get away from the DJ booth, what nonsense is this. Its my birthday and the DJ must take anybody request. It was my birthday. ruined my night. What a joke."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaHZucVB3EAE,Good comedy venue

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzhlTzdnRRAB,"The cheese set is delicious!! All the cheese tastes so creamy, very suitable for drinking. For the main course, we ordered the steak and chicken (I forgot the name of the chicken dish). The chicken was kinda mid, and nothing too special, I just tasted the bolognese sause and the mozzarella. The steak is good, tender and did not have much sauce so I can tasted the natural flavor of the beef."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzZ5b0lREAE,Great food and drinks. The vibe is amazing in there. Recommend a visit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScF8zc1NREAE,"Great spot, good vibes. Has a good outside balcony area to hang as well as a dancefloor for a boogie. What more could you want?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmF2cWp3RRAB,Nice rooftop bar
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmN2QnpRRRAB,"Wait staff here are atrocious. They‚Äôll take your drinks away from the table, even when you‚Äôve just purchased them from the bar. Check the CCTV. Got nothing to hide here"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGZ1RUZREAE,Best Parma in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ak1HUWNBEAE,Worst kfc around Victoria If they actually open they don't have chicken or main one I get is no chips and today they have a sign up saying not open till 1030 because deliveries? Guess all the deliveries get no chicken or chips just potato and gravey lol not a soul in store and it's 11am??
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUwtaWV3EAE,"The close time was 3am, we were there at 11am, there were not room in down floor and the manager didn't allow us to go upstairs!!!!!! We have 5 of us and a little kid The weather was too cold and they didn't allow us to seat inside, we had to dine in the car Very disappointing!!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWVmekN3EAE,rice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHJYV0F3EAE,"Fried chicken is average, not as good as Chinese kfc"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEl2Q1lBEAE,"The whole place was so unclean, bins full and no clean tables. Didn‚Äôt see anyone cleaning up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTUtajFnRRAB,"My poor burger appeared to have been drowned in an unappealing mixture of around 1 litre of Mayo and 1 litre of BBQ sauce. Truly a horrific dining experience, had to scrape waves of sauce off of a soggy piece of fried bat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTd2dE5BEAE,Rudest and slowest service ever! Also ultra dirty and littered.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2VyV2NBEAE,"I had a terrible experience. There are three pigeons living in the upper seat. Are these the ones KFC raises? God, I felt like I was eating in nature. The sight of a pigeon swallowing the French fries I spilled in one bite was impressive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaXE2TjdnRRAB,Its KFC cant complain but not the nest one in town
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaExLc1hnEAE,This rating is purely for Lloyd's service - Lloyd was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Couldn't hope for a better team member - thank you!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWZLYTBnRRAB,It's pretty fast There is a lot of people. The cleanliness of the environment needs to be strengthened
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2VuX1p3EAE,"Dirty, floor very sticky. Pigeon inside eating food off the floor and tables. Totally disgusting. Toilets, don't get me started."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXBQd2J3EAE,ordered a zinger burger which normally comes with mayo but instead i got one with supercharged sauce as the employee didn‚Äôt bother making a new burger and instead just handed me a burger that had been sitting in the chute for a good 10 minutes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoelBUZ0t3EAE,Just want to comment on the exceptional customer service provided by Lloyd today! This kid was dealing with a super busy period with a smile on his face and spoke so calmly and happily to each customer and greeted everyone so politely. 10/10 good job Lloyd!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM2F5ODR3RRAB,bad bad good beat bad bad = good bad bad good nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoem9fbVBnEAE,Great service. Always straight forward here
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M0pZLRAB,"We can have Yumcha all day here. There is No food cart going around. Instead we order by scan the QR code and the food come out quickly. I really like that the food here taste light, not too salty or too sweet. Will come back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N01DQVhBEAE,Quality of foods have really gone down.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUttWXh3RRAB,Awesome food. Been much better consistent quality after the renovation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUt6SDZ3RRAB,"The food is just average and the portion is small. However, the price is above average. Definitely, it's not value for money and no vow at all. Will not pay another visit in near future."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGZMb0l3EAE,"The food was good, flavourful and better tasting than your average Yum Cha restaurant. The ordering system was self served and the service was quick and efficient. The front of house greeter who showed us to our table was friendly and welcoming (a noted difference to the last time we visited). Definitely would visit again for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzk3a0xnEAE,Great food easy and tasty. The food are great busy during weekend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZzlXdkNnEAE,A large variety of Hong Kong style dim sims and yummy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazZ1MWlnRRAB,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. Been at least  dozen times over the years. The place is perfect. Food is always up to the standard so no matter how many times you revisit you won't be disappointed. Staff are slightly abrupt but not rude. Food sometimes comes out too quickly... yes I know imagine complaining about that... but if you are looking to enjoy your food slowly, maybe order in 2 batches."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM2YydzNRRRAB,Food was nice but staff were a bit short and didn‚Äôt listen
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmNQUGN3EAE,"My gosh, the service and speed was exceptional! The food was very good, but wouldn‚Äôt call it exceptional. The mango sago pudding was lacking in sago, the egg custard tarts could have been more flaky, and just in general some of the flavours were quite mild. Nevertheless a great place a definitely worth visiting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScVk2bHBRRRAB,"This is my second time visiting Tim Ho Wan and sadly it just doesn‚Äôt live up to its hype. It‚Äôs still just an okay yum cha. Some dishes tasted like pre-made frozen food (i.e. shrimp dumpling). Not a fan of the weirder dishes they offer. They‚Äôre positive is that they are open late for dinner.  Normally a line during afternoons. Easier to get a table for dinner.  15% holiday/weekend surcharge.  Ordered: ‚Ä¢ Vermicelli roll with Chinese donut ($10.50) 8/10 ‚Ä¢ Vermicelli roll with shrimp ($10.50) 6/10 ‚Ä¢ Steam pork and button mushroom with black bean sauce ($9.40) 6.5/10 ‚Ä¢ Prawn dumpling ($10.50) 6/10 ‚Ä¢ Beancurd skin roll with pork and shrimp ($8.50) 7/10 ‚Ä¢ Fried Beancurd skin roll with shrimp ($8.80) 7/10 ‚Ä¢ Wasabi salad prawn dumpling ($9.30) 6/10 ‚Ä¢ Congee with seafood ($10.80) 6/10 ‚Ä¢ Hong Kong milk tea ($4.50) 7/10  Pricing is pretty standard compared to other yum cha restaurants. Proportions are slightly smaller.  Standard, quick service.  Plenty of seating, especially after they revamped the restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHVuNkNREAE,Overall we loved our yum cha. Must order the BBQ Pork buns and the sticky rice. The steamed dumplings are always fresh here too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnFMV21nRRAB,No split bills: instant 1 star.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc0tXUHhBRRAB,a bit less choice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTdlV2lRRRAB,Good tasty food with a price tag. Have had better ones in Sydney. The good thing was the food was deliveries fadt!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczhtZ3dRRRAB,"delicious a bit expensive Good service, served very quickly clean shop"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURveklXUEd3EAE,"Tim Ho Wan has recently become our go to yum cha place; we have family living on opposite ends of Melbourne and it's nice to meet in the middle.  You use the QR code menu, place your order (pay at the end of the meal) and food comes out quick. First dishes were out within 10 minutes, with all 16 of our dishes out within 20.  It's meant to be a Michelin Star restaurant. Does it taste like it? I reckon. Not super fancy, but I'd describe it as ""attainable luxury"". For 16 dishes and a couple of drinks on a public holiday, bit under $200. Not bad at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2RYakt3EAE,"Average food, lackluster for a Melbourne CBD restaurant"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaFlqWlRREAE,"We've always liked this place for decent and quick feed. Post renovations, the portions seem smaller. The chicken feet was quite dry and not as succulent; our previous favourite prawn chive dumpling, the skin was not as silky as before. Other dim sum items are still ok. Will give it another go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHZIaGR3EAE,"Came to eat again after the renovation, the interior looks so much better. The food is excellent, except for the ribs sadly. Our favourite was the BBQ buns! Always order one to take away for my parents to have at home. Portions are small but filling ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHNieUlREAE,Delicious and quick yum cha style food. A good place for a quick feed but not a place to spend none eat time at
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN1B6OUJ3EAE,"We had a early light dinner and this was perfect.The restaurant hadn't started to pick up for the dinner crowd so we were seated straight away and our orders came out quickly. Super order to p,ace your order by scanning the QR code for your table number and ordering g. Payment is at the counter on your way out. The food was fresh and full of flavour. The only slight negative was how cold the restaurant was, we had to leave our coats on for dinner and it was still an uncomfortable cold."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXN6V2dBRRAB,"I give this restaurant two thumbs up! It is a jewel among the Chinese restaurants buried in the hustling and bustling of Melbourne‚Äôs uptown area. My wife and I are spending a five day vacation here and craving for a hearty Chinese dinner after a day trip to Sovereign Hills Gold Mine. I searched on Google and decided to come here for dinner. We are both so happy that we made this decision. It was a busy Saturday night and all tables have been reserved. The hostess helped secure a table on the corner of the restaurant intended for walk-ins. We choose three common dishes to my wife‚Äôs liking. The service was fast and the quality of dishes were beyond our expectations. A vegetarian dish, a spicy pork dish and a fish fillet in a hot pot. They were genuine Sichuan style cuisine. We savored every bit of the dishes we ordered. People are warm and hospitable. When traveling far away from home, what can one ask more than a hearty meal! This eatery deserves a five star rating for the food they serve. üëç"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodFlHN0lnEAE,"It's a nice and stylish restaurant - first impression. However the food was horrible. It was a cold dish. I had ""Steamed Chicken With Peanuts, Chinese Celery And Peanut Butter Sauce"". The chicken had over and over bones in the chicken cubes. Just impossible to eat. When I claimed it the staff wouldn't respond and I didn't get any better food and I had to pay the full price. Hands off! Chris"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaExYczRRRRAB,"Not too sure about the mixed reviews here but based on my personal experience, I‚Äôd rate it a 5/5 undoubtedly. Service was amazing (which is super rare given that it‚Äôs an Asian restaurant). Food was great as well! We got their chilli oil fish, braised eggplant, stir fry vermicelli with prawns and cold noodles with shredded chicken. All dishes were cooked perfectly. Dishes came out steaming hot and fresh. We would definitely revisit to try out other dishes!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCd2JqV1hBEAE,"Menu photos are exaggerated and don‚Äôt reflect what you‚Äôre gonna get. The restaurant won‚Äôt cater to your asking either.  There is a large gap between the real object and the picture, and the store is unwilling to make adjustments."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCME5QRFJnEAE,"Don‚Äôt eat it in the future, everyone. Half a duck will give you a quarter. It‚Äôs still not fresh. I bought a lonely one for 40 yuan. The waiter is still cursing. Shame"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbzlyZWt3RRAB,"This place serves authentic Sezhuan food. It used to be quite crowded, now we came here only second table in the whole resto. The lighting is a bit dimmed, feels like niteclub atmosphere. Nothing to complain about the food, all excellent. They are just a bit expensive, ranging from $25 to $70s, with average about high $30s. This time we ordered diced chicken, a bit surprise that it is cold dish. It is delicious nonetheles, and beef with bambooshots. Top notch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdVozRmZnEAE,"The place is a little dark with mood lighting kind of place. Reminds me a little of a night club.  Food is actually quite good, spice level is great, and price is a slightly on pricier side."

I had said I did not want anything to drink but had ordered ‚Äòlamb‚Äô, what was most extraordinary was instead of just admitting to making a mistake she went on at which point my partner had to join in and say I had definitely ordered the meal but no drinks. To her credit she did manage to get it fairly fast. What a bizarre experience each of us eating our meal on our own."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3BDRXR3RRAB,Really great service and a lovely atmosphere. A good selection of alcohol as well as really good meals.

After having terrible customer service at our dinner restaurant we came to Mr Munro for drinks and dessert. We wanted to pay with a restaurant gift card and the staff more more than happy to help us with that method of payment ( unlike our dinner restaurant)  We were so impressed by the service at mr Munro that we decided to come back for breakfast. Even though we weren‚Äôt staying at the hotel staff allowed us to partake in the buffet breakfast and it was delicious!!  I just can‚Äôt say enough how the staff at mr Munro made our weekend! Thank you so much and we will definitely be coming back again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTRueFhREAE,"Booked the private room Miss Miley for my bestfriends Hens.  We had last minute dietary requirements and Jayden the host was so accommodating it was fantastic. All the food was lovely and portions were great too.  Thanks again, everyone had a great time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWVtUl9RRRAB,"Great atmosphere, staff and food! Highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGVmZkVBEAE,"Decided to have meals at this restaurant twice this week, for convenience, as I was staying at the hotel next door. Food was just okay. However, the second time I went for a meal, I received a very pathetic 'rocket salad', which came with a small drizzle of balsamic oil and a petite portion of grated pecorino cheese..... to the tune of $16.00. This was an added request intended to compliment my 'small bites' order. Although this was 'off menu', it was still extremely overpriced for what was received. Otherwise, Service was bland, by both bar staff and female restaurant Manager. Food was akin to cheap Pub Grub only more expensive. Do not, unfortunately, recommend unless desperate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodTl2dkV3EAE,"Staff wonderful. Food is pedestrian and I have to say you get exactly what is described. Really just an expensive chain restaurant experience.  Excellent service, mediocre to average food. Will try breakfast, hope is better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3E2bklREAE,"I had dinner at Mr.Munro for Valentine‚Äôs dinner. Everyone I spoke with from Mr. Munro, provides excellent customer service! All staff were very friendly and helpful. Valentine Set menu was cute."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2REV1ZBEAE,Had Cocktails and Cheese board. My wife had an amaretto sour that was delicious. Great range of whiskey... will definitely go again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd1l5YWtBRRAB,"Since it‚Äôs reopened, it‚Äôs like a new place! I came here for my mum‚Äôs birthday dinner and the new manager and other staff were so kind and brought out our cake with candles and made her feel so special. Highly recommend the Lamb Ragu and a margarita"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcnVmZlZBEAE,Love this place! Fantastic service and food. Reasonable prices as well! Definitely will make this our go to when in the area! Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb3VpbkNBEAE,Nice Latte art! The Coffee tastes great. Espresso good too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzlLNzR3RRAB,"üëÄ We had a group dining setup in one of the stunning private dining rooms. MM is kind of hidden, we walked past it at first.  üí• It is a sexy venue! Especially the private dining setups.  üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Service was amazing, so attentive!  üç∑  I had a beer!  Entre√® I had the Oysters and these were delicious and stunningly vibrant mignonette.  For mains we had the Grass Fed Dry Aged 200gm chargrilled Yarra Valley Eye Fillet with Red Wine Jus and crispy goose fat salted potatoes. I had the Victorian Rainbow Trout with capers, garlic butter, shaved fennel and Meyer lemon, it was a beautifully thinly sliced piece of fish. The addition of capers etc made it feel like an entree, I liked it!! I loved the veg dish of Roast Butternut squash with apple and vegetable, crunchy kale and cider cream sauce, I was so excited for the vegetarian in our group as she had the ‚Äúwow‚Äù dish, different from the rest of the trip. Our table had sides of  sweet potato fries and carrot kale and snow pea feta salad. For dessert I had the Caramelized Citrus Tart with Honey Creme Fraiche & Candied Ginger which had beautiful presentation and equally as delicious.  I would love to check out the brekkie menu and please put the oysters back on the menu!  ‚ú® Thank you to the wonderful staff at Mister Munro for having us!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc0tPbEtBEAE,"We hired a private dining room for my husbands birthday.  Kelly was so helpful and great at communicating in the lead up.  The food was fantastic. Everyone was so happy.  It was great just to sit back and enjoy  The service was some of the best we have had.  Very professional,  always someone there when you needed help,  but not intrusive  a special shut-out to Al- he was amazing.  Would definitely book there again for a special occasion."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhek1lRlJnEAE,"Ordered a pizza and requested no ham, received a pizza with ham. Ordered Napoletana Fettuccine, received spaghetti.  Two stars for the friendly service but the food was very very average."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdU5MNXNBRRAB,Had dinner yesterday and breakfast this morning. Loved it. Friendly staff. Gorgeous decor. Great food snd beverage choices. Reasonable prices. Nothing not to like. WAs staying next door at Victoria Hotel. It was nice just to wander next door for meals instead of going out and further.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeDVHWW93RRAB,"NEVER GO HERE! I had made a booking for 8 people on a Friday night, all travelling from different locations to attend. On arrival the restaurant was completely empty and I was told by the one staff member that he ""thought"" we cancelled our booking. I provided him with evidence of our booking, which had never been cancelled and he continued to try and say he was told its cancelled. Further to this, he showed absolutely no care or solution and just said sorry about that, there's nothing we can do. I had to re direct 7 others for a special occasion dinner and walk around the city for 45 minutes trying to find another restaurant.  The worst experience I have ever had and worst customer service. I can see exactly why they did not have one customer in there. Save yourself the bother."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxLWNDUGx3RRAB,"Very disappointed with the lack of organisation. After restrictions were lifted (restaurants opened), we booked a dinner on Sat at 6;30pm. We drove all the way to the city and came at 6:30 and it was empty. We received no cancellation email until 4 hours later at 10:30 which was obviously useless."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdWFMWklBEAE,"DONT book here, they are closed and have not updated any platforms including google."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTh6Ti13RRAB,I am so grateful
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScThQOVh3EAE,"What a special place! Sensational experience, amazing Sashimi, Sushi and exceptional service. Love the little discrete location of this place as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdUxqVW1RRRAB,Amazing customer service. Would recommend the kingfish and sando! $$$$
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDREMmhBRRAB,"Honestly, it was okay‚Ä¶we got the chef‚Äôs tasting menu. we expected a lot more Japanese inspired food. But there was more of contemporary dining experience, where we were sat at the bar and watching the chef cook. Wasn‚Äôt worth for the price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHZtT193RRAB,Lovely food. Went there with a big group and had a lovely time. Great food and really good service. Only thing was music was a little loud and it was kinda hard to find. Highly recommend the taiyaki for dessert
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaG9HSmxBRRAB,"Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in my entire life! Absolutely amazing food in a cool, yet relaxed atmosphere.  Do yourself a favour and check this place out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaFBuUThBRRAB,"I visited this place after seeing a review in the age, specifically the mention of amazing fried chicken wings. The wings were great but everything else was a real eye opener, a new take on traditional Japanese cuisine. The eggplant salad looks nothing like a salad when it's served, but it's an adventure in taste and texture. The aforementioned chicken wings were great, the fry job was excellent but they lacked a bit of flavour. The highlights were the carrot tempura and the incredible and surprising icecream Sando for desert. Definitely worth a visit for someone looking for great and slightly different Japanese food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOWNlSXJBRRAB,Incredible food and hidden location that was let down by poor management of kitchen and service. We watched 2 tables arrive after us and leave before us because the kitchen and servers couldn't figure out which course we were up to. They proceeded to serve everyone else before us which left us waiting up to 30+ minutes between each course. This said the food was amazing but was definitely let down by the hungry wait between each round.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWRfN25nRRAB,"Great food, service, sake, and vibe! Been here once many years ago and still great! Coming back for more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodVlMMmNREAE,"We visited last night,  The food was gorgeous, vibes are great Jarrod was the best !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3R1OWZREAE,"Take my wife here today for our Valentine Day. Have order the set menu. Everything was perfect, my favourite dishes was Marlin Crudo, it taste so creamy and full of flavour. Never had something like that, it is amazing!  Good job chef Jarrod ü´° and rest of the crew!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdzhTenF3RRAB,Great food and service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNmNyWTdRRRAB,"As good as it gets. The venue, the hospitality, the food. If you‚Äôre a foodie looking for a great experience, do yourself a favour and visit. Jarrod & Paul, keep up the great work"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLXRDZDhnRRAB,"Izakaya Den just provided one of the most memorable culinary experiences of my life. From the cool underground setting, to the artisan skill of the chefs, and the myriad of flavours included in the set menu, I was left both spellbound and speechless for the duration of the meal. The beef brisket melts in your mouth in a way that makes you rethink the very definition of the clich√©. Thank you Miyuki, your hospitality and passion for food is intoxicating."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdHVqQ3hBRRAB,Amazing and delicious Japanese food! Love they‚Äôre different take on the dishes and the fresh sashimi! Cocktail are also great and love the bar seating!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM0p1WFNBEAE,This is not the place it once was.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteVlHd2ZBEAE,"A friend treated me to dinner here. Hidden away, I never would have found it, which makes it so exciting. I was like, where are we going?! The atmosphere was perfect, and the service was beyond amazing. We got the person in charge to choose our meals for the night, and every one of them are something I wouldn't have chosen personally by reading what it's called, but after tasting them I was blown away. I hate mushrooms, the first thing I had was some mushroom dish, and it was my favourite. It was the best damn thing I've ever had. Everything I ate that night was amazing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcDctal9nRRAB,"Service is outstanding!! However we got the banquet, which for $115 was very underwhelming."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlLWZDemRnEAE,"A very disappointing experience. When we arrived the person greeted us while on the phone and we had to stand there for a few minutes until he finished the call. The vegan set menu is far too overpriced, food came out too slowly and the desserts to share were horrid. After spending over $300 my partner and I left hungry. Only positive is that the food runner‚Äôs service was professional. P.S. making a piece of asparagus look like is has a tail doesn‚Äôt make it worth $17."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURld1kydndRRRAB,"We came here for my daughter‚Äôs 21st, it‚Äôs not the kind of restaurant we usually go to, but we enjoyed it. The food was pricey but high quality, beautifully presented & delicious. The dishes are ‚Äòsmall plate‚Äô type. Service was very attentive. Although we didn‚Äôt request it, dessert came with a birthday candle which was a lovely surprise."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlanItcTNnRRAB,Not sure if we visited on an off night. Waiter was friendly and service was reasonable but the food was very mediocre and extremely expensive for what it was. Serves were tiny and I really struggled to work out if it was at all Japanese. We all finished the $115 per head degustation and left hungry!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlM1BhTEhREAE,Beautifully presented and crafted meal and very professional and friendly staff. I'll be coming back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0tIVWlBRRAB,"Good food, attentive & friendly staff. Very expensive for what you‚Äôre getting though but the food is of high quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LUoycEZnEAE,Amazing atmosphere üôåüèæüôåüèæ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1am9qNHp3RRAB,"Not a place for dining actually, more to having drinks. Not for people who wanted a place to chat as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNjltOHd3RRAB,Fresh food. Delicious
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEoyMmpnRRAB,"Favourite place to go. Great place, great service and great food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEo3ckh3EAE,"What can I say, two thumbs up. The food is great and service is  excellent. I highly recommend the combination plate...."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NUktTDd3RRAB,"Good meal, good drinks, good service and reasonably priced. But music too loud"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEo3b21nRRAB,Great food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzVPWFpBEAE,How can you not have fun with a bucket-sized margarita! The restaurant has a great vibe and we really enjoyed our food.  We'll be back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGFUMEZBEAE,Cute little restaurant with authentic food. Quick kind service. Delicious food that didn't leave you feeling heavy or hungry. We were still raving about hours later.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXNXWFBREAE,"Tasty food,nice vibes"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3FUbk53EAE,Very nice environment and food with amazing service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNkpTejF3RRAB,"Food 3.5, cleanliness 1; We were once turned back just after 12 by the staff saying they were not yet open (though the timings are 12 onwards). Second time there were some deliveries sitting at the entrance thawing in a puddle when we got there. Barring these, food was good and nice ambience. Vegetarian taco option was not great but fish was delish. Only men‚Äôs loo was open. Ladies was locked. Up a flight of stairs, so not easily accessible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScy03VnNRRRAB,Good place to have Mexican food in the town. #hidden place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGU2X1FBEAE,Perfect.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmNPa3lBRRAB,The guy who took our order forgot about our food until we complained to him.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeVlpU3J3RRAB,Very good food with generous portions
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM3BMLU5nEAE,"Food great, service great. Space!! A bit tight but thats the only complaint i have otherwise very yummy food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnZXWWxRRRAB,"The food very rich. I recommend the nachos and ""the combination"". There were a lot of people so we had to wait a bit for the food but it was worth it. The staff very friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHZ1UVdREAE,Taco Bill may not be a particularly ‚Äòfoodie‚Äô type restaurant but you have to hand it to them for having so many of these venues all over Melbourne for such a long period of time considering they aren‚Äôt particularly cheap for what you get. I always enjoy my meal while noting that the fare is not reminiscent of what I ate in Mexico. I recommend the chicken flautas with a side of sour cream. Not on the menu anymore but they‚Äôll still make it if you ask  Update Back we came to use the tokens (great marketing tactic) alas we left them at home so we will back yet again. Enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa. This used to be standard but I‚Äôve noticed other chains have abandoned it of late. Delicious nachos every time  Original review I would not be exaggerating in the slightest to say I've been to Taco Bill 50 times over the past ten plus years but I just wanted to commend this branch on their service. After an enjoyable catch up with a girlfriend for dinner the staff gave us a free sombrero and complimentary margarita tokens to use next time. Like I needed a reason to go back for more mango tequila goodness. Yum
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobS1pUEt3EAE,"Not expecting the world, but when you walk into a fire trap - base of stairs crowded with full gas canisters, irony not lost as they also blocked access to fire hose reel and main riser/hydrant. You do not have to be a brain surgeon to know that is the start of serious news story. Climb up the stairs fine, then pleasant welcoming of nod of head, no real words. Sat at table where table should not be. I was directly next to the ""pass"" and everytime the food was ready my right ear was assaulted with the lound ring of the bell. That was quickly followed by my chair being kicked as the serving staff came to pick up the food. That along with if I learnt back my head and shoulder hit the shelf of the pass. It was busy and so some delays were to be expected, but being left in the corner, I think we were ignored, now unlike no-one putting baby in a corner, I ain't no baby, so 110kg hard to miss, but missed we were. At least I was kept entertained by the arguments between the kitchen and the servers as order mistakes or confusion increased delays and therefore pressure. I noted to other tables sat after us, get drinks, mains and one table even finished. The meals came out after 45 minutes or so, but no drinks. Eventually, the server apologised as the frozen margaritas had run out so more had to be made. When ours arrived, yes you've guessed it, not frozen - slushy machines are like that - you need to let the machine do its job, otherwise it's just a vaguely cool mango puree squash drink. Maybe my body language, or at least the slipped discs in my neck from having to sit all cockeyed, but when the bill was asked for, the server asked if I was angry. I choose not to answer as none of the experience tonight was her fault. The owner needs to stop and have a look at what service actually looks like. Wanting to get out before being caught in a blazing inferno, I didn't have the time or courage to use the toilet. Initial views were, as the rest of the restaurant not promising. Broken door, broken bins, broken tiles and paper towels strewn over the floor. So, if you want an experience of 3rd world Mexican based food, go to a bario in Mexico. The risk of kidnapping and ransoming much less than the migraine inducing posture requirements and time delays at minimum, this establishment will give. Seriously sort out the fire hazard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMF9TZEtBEAE,"Good mexican food, but the atmosphere is compact and somewhat noisy. There is Halal sign outside, but be warned the place serves alcohol. The staff are nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWV6NGNnEAE,The place is very colorful and I feels like I‚Äôm in Mexico at the moment. All the tacos was amazing I couldn‚Äôt stop to order
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodVpuM0pBEAE,"Great food, but the interior looks a bit run down"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobWJiQWlRRRAB,"Great food,  friendly service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4elByUEpnEAE,"This place has very tasty burgers they did say their meat is halal for the halal eaters but also serve pork, they did say that is cooked on different appliances."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MVBpTGJ3EAE,I went in after very high praises from my friend. Cant say that i have ever faced bigger disappointment. Spent 17$ each for burgers which didnt even seem worth 4$. It was the worst.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bElEMkF3EAE,Simpson's Burgers are to die for.  First time trying them the burgers are amazing you can taste the freshenss and the flavours of the food. The chips dn't get me started on the chips they sooooo delicious and crispy üòã üëå üòç and that place people line up outside the door.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LU82UG1RRRAB,Best burger I have ever had. Highly recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dU4ybVlBEAE,The burger I‚Äôve been looking for over a decade !!! Juicy and fresh!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aU9qTEFREAE,"Burgers are made to order, fantastic flavour, juicy and succulent, buns are actually toasted unlike most burger joints and the chips are always hot and crispy. Fantastic. Only minor complaint is that the interior of the joint is terribly smoky, I reckon the fume hood isn't up to scratch. Excellent burgs though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEt5Z1hBEAE,"Burger is good, but not great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEtUQ013EAE,"Great spot to get lunch in the city. Food is out quick and tastes great. Weirdly their fish and chips are absolutely amazing, I always get it when I go. Portion sizes are also fantastic, seriously, can't recommend the place enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMF9mMmRBEAE,Nice chips and juicy burger
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMF9lTUpBEAE,"I search up good burgers in the city. Had to scroll down a bit but ended up finding this gem!! Absolutely amazing burgers, so juicy and full of flavour!!! Also the chips are to die for, and I don‚Äôt usually eat fried chips!!! üòçüòçüòçüòç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDd6b2FBEAE,Yummy Borgor
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd2ZLZVNBEAE,"Look, it's just a scruffy little cafe. But you can smell that meat being burnt from right up the street. These are the BEST burgers I've found in the CBD so far, and believe me, I've been trying hard. The staff are also lovely. üòä"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa3F6VGl3RRAB,Just the best spicy burgers in Melbs
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHBtR1h3EAE,"Dont let the look of this place put you off...this place has the BEST burgers I've tasted in a long time! Also, I had the fish & chips and onion rings - so delicious...highly recommend this place!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk1xWEFnEAE,"Very rude staff, arrogant and childish. Ordered a meal asking for extra sauce and pickles. Heard the guy at the back laugh and whisper ""like she needs any extra"" I then said excuse me and he laughed directly in my face. Told them I will leave this review and walked out. Worst experience I've ever had. Laughing at my weight obesity is no joke."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbklxWVdBEAE,Disgusting food. Saw 2 cockroaches around the table I was dining at and the entrance. Should be shut down.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajRpOTFBRRAB,Amazing taste!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMl9yMUxnEAE,Could have been a 5 star rating as the burger bun and Pattie were top notch but the bacon was salty and overpowered the taste. I removed the bacon and ate the rest of my burger which was then delicious. I tried eating the bacon on it's own but it was definitely too salty. I would absolutely eat here again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDlPaTl3RRAB,"I recently visited Simpson Burgers for lunch and I'm so glad I did! The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, and the staff were so friendly and attentive. I had the 'Spicy Fries', and I have to say, it was the best burger I have ever tasted! The bun was fresh and fluffy, the cheese melted just perfectly and the special Simpson Burger sauce gave the burger the most amazing flavour. Overall, I would highly recommend Simpson Burgers - they're definitely my favourite burger joint!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWI3ekVnEAE,"The burger here was sensational üòä, clearly the best burger joint in all of the Melbourne CBD area, the $14 or $15 I paid for just one burger, completely justified, the meat was cooked perfectly, the special sauce tasted amazing and the other ingredients just complemented each other beautifully üòç, the only negatives I can think of is the burger probably just needs a stick in it to hold it together and some of the lettuce just came out a bit, but overall definitely worth the mess though, you will definitely not be disappointed with these burgers üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWF2cllBEAE,American Burger was 7/10 for me. Tasted like a good homemade burger.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2ViaVpnEAE,"Simpsons burgers have some of the best food I‚Äôve tasted in a very long time! Great range of burgers and sides, at a very affordable price. Exquisite flavour combinations, and everything is freshly made. Customer service is brilliant staff are all lovely and even remembered names of customers. Greatly recommend this place, they are extraordinary."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2VhQURREAE,"One word can describe simpsons chips and burgers, Astonishing. I tried the simpsons burger and it was fabulous. The patty and cheese combination was a thrilling combination of flavours and really blended well into my diverse pallet. Throughout my time at simpsons burgers I was able to try the loaded fries, Now when I tell you that my mouth had a shaking orgasam as the sause dropped into my taste buds. The combination of the spices from the jalape√±o and saltiness of the chips. The customer service was also a 10/10 the staff were lovley and learnt our names as we kept coming back for more of their delectable confectionery goods."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2NhbDF3RRAB,"Great food, great service, flavours are thrilling and food is not too oily or greasy, couldn‚Äôt ask for much more"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbi1LZTBnRRAB,"The lighting in the restaurant is extremely dim, it is difficult to see the texture of the dishes and the menu, and the dining experience is not satisfactory. The prices of the dishes are extremely expensive, and the quality of cooking does not match the price. Although the pictures of the dishes look good, the taste is not satisfactory."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSejlEMFhBEAE,"If I was sentenced to death and could choose any meal I want, I would probably order from this restaurant. Incredibly good food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDVTQUR3EAE,"Wonderful food, lovely staff and super cosy atmosphere...would recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTlHeEZREAE,"A wonderful dining experience with fine food, beverages and excellent service. I highly recommend people consider a night out at Sezar to sample the dishes from Armenia. I recommend you book early and catch an Uber or Taxi to the venue. Parking in this area of town as melbournites should know, can be expensive and sparse."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0ajRhcG1nRRAB,"The food here is fabulous every time, the atmosphere and staff are lovely. A must try is the Kataifi wrapped lamb but every dish is delicious. Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTQzRnlnRRAB,Great service. Good food. Nice place for some different style of cuisine.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamMzY0xnEAE,"I had quite high expectations for Sezar as had heard some great things. On the plus side, the service was friendly and attentive. The food was super tasty - really interesting flavours and nicely presented. On the down side, although we had booked 10 days prior and the restaurant wasn't full when we arrived, we were firstly offered a really terrible table - right near the service desk, front door and the route from the dining area to the toilet. Thankfully we spotted a better table ourselves and the waiter was happy for us to take that. Second issue (and perhaps it was just our table) the lighting was terrible. It was so dark we had to use the torches on our phones to read the menu. Last issue the portion sizes are tiny. $44 for a beef main that was perhaps 100g of meat. Just meat and and sauce. $17 for a pumpkin side that was delicious, but just three small slices of pumpkin and its topping.  The lamb rib starter was superb but two lamb ribs each perhaps a mouthful was a bit steep at $20 something. The food was great but these few issues did detract from our visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2JfWUhnEAE,Amazing. Food was spectacular but the service was even better. Highly recommend üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenVDUjlBRRAB,Amazing experience! Food was delicious! Loved everything about this restaurant
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXBLWFFREAE,"all the food was divine, perfect temperature and taste and such nicely proportioned. the service was lovely, if you have Dom as your server, you are in luck, she is so kind and bubbly and has very good vibes, also dresses well. the service is so impeccable, you wont see an empty water glass, they‚Äôll fill it back up before it‚Äôs empty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHNfOEhBEAE,"Probably the best food I‚Äôve ever eaten at that price point. Highlights were the broccoli skewers, the hummus, and the baklava ice cream. My only complaint is that there was too much food and I have no self-control."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNa2JDVmNnEAE,"Came back again for a second time, and amazing food experience! Literally took no photos of the food as we couldn't get over how good it was, thanks to Dom our hostess, she was awesome too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUoyR1VnEAE,"Went with some friends to try Armenian food for the first time and was not disappointed. The flavours are phenomenal and the portions are generous. The wine was beyond our expectations, and the staff there were extremely knowledgeable on not only the wines flavours, but on the vineyards themselves. Couldn‚Äôt fault the service, it was attentive and warm, we felt well looked after and had a great laugh with them as well. You have to come and try it out, there‚Äôs no better fine dining venue with a wholesome family touch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMkxPeVJ3EAE,"The second time we have dined at Sezar and both times, it has been exceptional. The service and food are fantastic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajdQMEZnEAE,"Sensational dinner at SEZAR Melbourne.  Fine dining food with the warmest, welcoming service. Couldn't fault a thing.  We ate:  HOMMUS | chickpeas, brown butter, toasted lavash KATAIFI WRAPPED LAMB | sesame aioli PALM SUGAR & SUMAC CHICKEN| sous-vide, pomegranate honey, pickled onion, herbs = softest chicken I've ever had. ROAST HAPUKA | pumpkin & lentil fatteh, sweet potato kataifi, yogurt - A white fish, divine NEW STYLE BAKLAVA | walnut toffee ice cream, salted caramel OMG"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSem9XYmZ3EAE,Good vibe.. not my taste in food but good quality
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSanVPNXdBRRAB,Our party of 4 dined on the 4 course Chef's selection and we highly recommend it. Wonderfully professional staff which enhanced our dining experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHZXakNBEAE,Good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNXVXSFBBEAE,"Really tasty food. Def go the chefs selection. Three course was plenty. Service was good but the staff definitely aren‚Äôt hospo veterans but such is the current staffing climate. Only 3 stars because the place is bloody filthy. Walls, doors and toilets all disgusting, and it‚Äôs a dark venue‚Ä¶..I‚Äôd hate to see it in the light of day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX09TTEhBEAE,"Tried Armenian food for the first time and we loved it!  The hummus had some brown butter mixed in (divine), the lamb ribs are umami bombs, the skewers perfectly charred, and the basmati fried rice with crispy onions hit the spot. üòã The chips were good too.  The crab manti was only okay though. There is also a credit card surcharge. If you book for more than 6 people, you need to get the set menu which is a bummer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSck1LMFFREAE,Lovely place to spend time with your loved ones.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoXy15aVdBEAE,Really lovely experience at the restaurant.The food was flavorful and well presented.The service was prompt and attentive .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDdlMVZREAE,"Would give it a zero if I could. The manager was rude, I really disappointed for that. Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation, waitress was amazing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbS1ib1JnEAE,"Didn't expect one of my favorite Japanese franchise would become like this... Sub par food quality and table service. Chawanmushi is over cooked and has less ingredients now. There used to be mushrooms and chicken pieces in the chawanmushi, and there's only edamame now. Sashimi is not top quality fresh. I can get same quality nigiri from sushi train for half of the price. My glass was empty for 20 mins and no one came to fill up the water. I also couldn't get any waiters attention because no one walked past my area... Food price has also gone up quite a bit but the quality of food has gotten worse. I had so much good memories dining at wagaya over the past years. Unfortunately will not return to eat here again after today."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGJ6eEhBEAE,"I love sukiyaki so much that I have visited this restaurant 5 times. But today was the worst meal ever.  When I brought my Japanese and Thai friends to this restaurant, I only had good memories, so I brought other friends after a long time. We ordered 3 highballs, Beef Sukiyaki Hot Pot,  Stir Fried Noodles, Chicken Yakitori, Eel Skewers, Wagyu Beef Skewers.  At first, the high ball came out, so I started drinking with excitement But the highball flavor was bland and there was no sparkling. The taste of highball was the worst compared to other restaurants There was only a slight taste of whiskey and lemon, but it was just lemon water. There was no carbonation. One out of three really tasted like water, so I talked to a female manager and asked him to change it. And I asked him to bring me water, so I said okay, but he didn‚Äòt give me water even after waiting for 10 minutes, so I asked if I could water another employee again.  Second, Sukiyaki came out and the meat was too big to share, so I asked if I could cut it in half, so the female manager went into the kitchen with the meat, saying okay, but the meat was not coming out again no matter how long I waited. At first, I thought it was because I was busy, so I waited, but 20 minutes passed, but the meat didn't come. So I called another employee to explain the situation.  he third side menu and stir-fried noodles began to come out, and the food was served very slowly, and all the hot foods were served cold.  I wouldn't have been this disappointed if I had eaten it for the first time in this restaurant. But it was a good restaurant, so I was really sad that it changed.  Last, An hour after ordering, Wagyu Beef Skewers didn‚Äôt come out to the end. So we didn‚Äòt have enough time, so we eventually called in the manager and asked for cancellation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWM3dDZnRRAB,"Tried to walk in but got stopped by the manager Daniel starting that they are 'fully booked' due to a promotion 50% when you book on 4th April. I then went onto the website the fork and saw that the restaurant has tables available at all time slots (30minutes). Ended up booking the table (no promotion) and went back to face a disgruntled Daniel. Requested to change to a booth table but was refused by Daniel saying that table had been booked by others, but finished my dinner in an hour and a half and the booth table is still empty. Sat down at the table for 15 minutes and no one to take our order so I had to walk up to the front and grab attention of the staff but I found that there were only 2 waiters busy with other tables. Food was mediocre at best and serving portions of meat were quite miserable. Got the tofu teriyaki but the outer crumbs were soggy. Wagyu hot plate had a tad of odour, and it was cooked with Brussel sprout a very odd pair of combination. The mackerel was good but the bottom bit got burnt making the fish taste quite bitter. The only redeeming factor was the scallops sashimi, it had a sweet taste to it showing it freshness. The beef tataki taste is pretty bland the sauce combination and the amount given is inadequate. This is a place I would not go in future even if it was 50% off, even worse I paid in full that day. 112 dollars for those dishes. Disappointing"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSek56bm5nRRAB,"I went on Saturday evening with a booking, with a friend. We were greeted by a nice male staff. When we queried what happened to the ipad ordering system they used to have we were informed that he is filling in as they are short staffed. We then had to use the scan link and use our smart phone to make an order. It was a bit difficult to this over the phone and the website automatically adds a tip without us being able to remove it. Second red flag right there. Order once placed we waited for someone to bring us water, 10 min later no water so we had to find someone to ask for it. 20min after the order we got a 5 piece sushi dish when it was labelled as a 6-piece sushi dish in the menu. When we asked about this we did get an apology and they brought us the additional one. We also ordered the beef skewers which were ALL FAT, we commented on that and we got another sorry. Clearly you can see the fat before cooking the meat. This was unacceptable. The gyoza came cold. The only good and hot dish we got was the fried chicken. Well you can guess that by now we just wanted to finish eating and get out of there. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN. Maybe they want to close it down. If I could put zero stars I would."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocV9qcl9nRRAB,"Disappointed is the only word I can use to describe this restaurant now. After being a frequent diner here for 10 years, the new management have absolutely ruined this restaurant by hiking up the prices by nearly double on some dishes whilst keeping the same portion sizes and removing the ordering tablets from tables that made this restaurant unique.  The new system requires a QR code on a smartphone which opens a clunky menu that requires a payment every single time you order. This automatically also applies a tip and a ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù which is a percentage of your total order price. Service fee for what? Your customers are doing all the work for you. You must be dreaming.  New wait staff are absolutely useless, we didn‚Äôt even get a table water at all through the night, something that you used to be able to order through the old tablet system.  It‚Äôs a shame to see what was once my favourite restaurant in Melbourne become easily one of my most disliked. The new management have taken this place downhill and you can tell they don‚Äôt have a single care, since they only reply to positive reviews. Should say enough.  Avoid at all costs and find somewhere better. That won‚Äôt be hard at all, since Wagaya has now set the bar that low."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodzdybVdBEAE,"What was once a pretty reliable place for affordable Japanese food with decent ambience is no longer. A change of management has resulted in a hike in prices, under trained staff, and a decline in food quality. New owner plans to turn the venue into a fine dining spot. We ordered a wagyu tataki that was chewy, thick, and didn‚Äôt even meet casual dining standards. A fine dining endeavour seems ambitious, if not, delusional. Music was obnoxiously loud and the playlist spanned commercial dance to 70‚Äôs. The iPad ordering system is gone and is replaced with a QR code to a very buggy Squarespace menu.  Other highlights:  - Mains came before entrees - Tempura came without tempura sauce - Salmon nigiri came without wasabi  Staff at the front were kind despite the circumstances. This seems to be a top-down issue by this new change of hands. „Åæ„Åü„Å≠„ÄÅ„ÉØ„Ç¨„É§ üëã"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNlo2M3B3RRAB,"For me, i think it is the right choice to dining here. Food is truly delicious, well-decorated with reasonable price. Moreover, staffs are friendly and helpful whenever i need them. Recommended"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3JhQTRnRRAB,"Do not recommend anymore. Poor quality food, not worth the price, go else where for Japanese.  Was a fantastic place but in 2023 there's been some sort of change, perhaps management, and overall the restaurant has just plummeted. Touch screens used to order food from are gone, replace with a buggy and sluggish QR order on phone system.  Menu range has been slashed drastically and prices have shot up. Regular items eg chicken skewers, which I would get multiple of, now I can literally count the dollars per bite.  Quality of the food itself has dropped. Eg friend noodles, basically clumped together and flavourless instant noodles.  You'd get better flavour and quality with a packet of instant noodles from the supermarket.  Sushi and sashimi was fish you could tell was old, and again rice that was old, dry and very under seasoned.  The final straw was the service. Understaffed and very confusing. I booked well in advanced and was emailed a confirmation to have a booth but instead I placed on a table with the sun literally in our face. Staff literally opened up my booking request in front of me and ignored it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocjg2VzBBRRAB,"The food experience was good no complains, but I remember the ordering experience use to be better, relaying on your own mobile kinda sucks and if people order from different devices the waiters get the very confuse, not he same nice memory. Other reason why the 2 stars, the restaurant was stupidly under staff in the floor , they where only 2 waiters running like headless chickens, why are u trying to save money on staff?."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocmRUNWVnEAE,"The music was so loud you could hardly hear each other speak, we asked forbit to be turned down but staff said theybwerent allowed as noisy music was their policy. You have to order off your phone which is not easy to see the menu and you have to pay each time you order something before the order is sent to the kitchen. Some of the items say ""sold out"" but you can get them by asking the staff... and paying for them separately at the end...  Food was pretty good and seemed to be prepared by Japanese chefs and it came quickly once we had figured out the system.. They dont make things easy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWNEUzhBRRAB,Good atmosphere and decent food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaExhYV9RRRAB,"Quite difficult to find and place is a little old with the worn down benches and damp smelling private rooms but the food came out very fast and it was very delicious. Soft, fresh sashimi and wagyu hot plate was so fatty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2FHRk13EAE,"The food as always is great, I've been coming here for years. The only let down is that the tablets you order from are now gone and you have to use a QR code, when dining with a group it makes ordering a nightmare. Staff are great but not the original. Prices have gone up also. Booking a table has gotten easier though"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCanFUajZRRRAB,Food was horrid. We got a sashimi platter and the prawn & other items were spoiled. In the end they had to refund us. Never coming back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMi1iVXl3RRAB,Worst ever. Quality was seriously lacking. Regretting ever coming here while eating‚Ä¶ not a feeling you want to have while dining. Do not recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjVxelpREAE,"Worst everü•≤not only hard to find but also hard to eat happily here ü•≤poor quality high price. Save ur money,Don‚Äôt come. ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcVpxay1RRRAB,"Anti-referrence: After enjoying and supporting dining at Wagaya for the last 7 years, new management and their concept of ""trying something new"" have been able to quickly end our interest in attending there ever again. And they were able to achieve this in one sitting! No more electric menu on the wall with easy push-button options (which used to include calling a staff member to help). Only now able to use a QR-code with your phone to navigate through a slow tricky app by the way!  No hard-copy menus either...so heaven help the elderly who may not be into mobile phones!! Prices all increased to compliment much smaller portions and sizes of platters. My Californian Roll looked more the size of a Spring Roll! Very average food too. One of our orders reached the kitchen, but the staff accidentally ticked it that it was completed and sent. Thus 3 out of 4 at our table had meals, whilst our 4th person missed-out. After flagging down one of the managers about this, he asked to borrow my partner's phone and take it to the kitchen to suss-out the issue! My partner wasn't impressed and insisted on accompanying this guy with the phone! After the error was discovered, the 4th meal arrived and all of us could watch our friend eat it, as we'd all finished our entre-sized main courses 30 minutes before that. We hinted to a semi-apologetic management if we could be compensated in any way for this...and they uncomfortably declined. Sorry Wagaya, you were good while you lasted, won't be back! SAYONARA!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdkw2c0t3EAE,"Restaurant was ""moody"" (read: dimly lit) Staff seemed inexperienced and could only provide basic service. Squarespace online ordering was bug-ridden, difficult to use and slow to load any of the pages. Checkout process was manual, drawn out and clunky. But at least the food came out quickly (took less time to cook than it took to submit an order!) and it was tasty....altho we were starving by the time we finally got orders into the system so we would have eaten whatever they brought us. Portions were Japanese-size (tiny) so we ended up having to painfully submit a second order. Would not return - it's not worth the hassle."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteVozLW13RRAB,"No more physical menus or tablets to order dishes anymore. You have to scan a QR code on your phone to access the menu. After pressing on an item, you'll have to wait about 10 seconds for the next page to load. No more gluten free options either. Oh, if you thought by downloading the app would make ordering faster, it doesn't.. They are the same speed. If you need staff service, keep an eye out for them to call them. There is no buttons or call bells to call them either anymore.  I can only hope someone sees this and re-thinks about what they've done. Used to love this place. A pity.  EDIT: Food was initially 3/5 but proportions have significantly decreased too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNFpYZHBRRRAB,"Wagaya is Finn‚Äôs favourite Japanese restaurant. But recently they changed their menu and unfortunately, it‚Äôs not for the better.  Seared Salmon Sushi üç£ Fresh, quality salmon topped with salmon roe, Japanese mayo & eel sauce. So far so good.  Pan fried tofu is a downgrade, they replaced the agedashi tofu with this new dish where the pieces are smaller and not as crispy as they used to be. The sauce is good, but the tofu skin was missing some crunch.  Wagaya Salt Base Ramenüçú No change in the recipe. Had a light salty flavour. We liked the noodles, they had a great taste and bite to them. A good bowl of ramen.  Chicken Yakitoriüêî Have shrunk in size, the meat was just cooked, but it was missing some char. It tasted ok but it could‚Äôve been a lot better.  We were a little disappointed with the quality of some of the dishes this time around but we will come back to try other options.  Finn Bites dining experience 3.9/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è $$ üíµ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNklqTGl3RRAB,"Used to be a nice place to visit for dinner. Now prices have gone up, changed ordering system to QR code where tips is applied by default.  We ordered 2 pasta, and 2 sushi dishes bringing the total to $70 already. Food quality was alright, but not worth the price.  Loud disco music was playing among mandarin songs and they couldn‚Äôt lower the volume when we asked."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ01HT2x3RRAB,"Food was good enough. The cooked dishes was great, fresh raw items could be of better quality for the price.  Service wasn't great (but could also be that they are training new staff which is fair, but still expected more from Wagaya)  But food is good enough for me to come back in the future  to see if service will improve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcTVfUTlnRRAB,Nice Japanese restaurant in CBD. Food are up to standard. The hotpot tastes good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaXNpdUFnEAE,"Last time I dined there, they didn‚Äôt even bother to serve us water. I walked out of the restaurant feeling thirsty. The ordering machine at our table was broken and they refused to switch our table to another table of our choice because we ‚Äúbooked‚Äù for that specific one we sat in apparently. The other table that we wanted to move to had no one there the entire time we dined there. No sure why they wouldn‚Äôt just let us switch over so that we can have a better dining experience. Food was just okay. Some are good, and some are average. Would not go back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlN1lTU2tnRRAB,"This used to be one of my favourite places to come for Japanese because of its variety of options and relatively cheap prices. However, recently the management of the place changed (they told us themselves) and the prices have just risen to a level where you are no longer able to get the same experience.  Just to give you an example, 5 pieces of gyoza now cost 14.90 meaning almost $3 per gyoza (they are slightly small too), and a coke costs $6.  Additionally, although I'm not sure if it's a mistake or not, we ordered $81 worth of food, but card payments have a 1.5% surcharge which brought it to $83 on the tab given to us at the table, but I was charged $84 when actually paying.  It seems they are transitioning a bit towards fusion food too. A lot of new menu items in their offerings use western ingredients not commonly seen in Japanese dishes and have combination dishes that I would probably expect out of a western place trying to serve Japanese influenced food. We didn't try any of those so I won't comment on them, but maybe it's an incoming shift that people should be aware of.  All I would say is, if you're a returning customer, be aware it's not the same experience and the prices are much higher than before. If you're a new customer, the food isn't bad, but in my personal opinion it's not worth the price they are charging now (which you'll see reflected in many of the recent reviews of this place)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHZtem13RRAB,"A fun, cheesy jungle themed decorated bar that does happy hour. Strange choice of outdoor furniture indoors but if you‚Äôre staying at the hotel it‚Äôs very convenient and well priced."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNlB5NXdBRRAB,"Ordered room service for a booked specified time. Food arrived over an hour early, lukewarm, in a paper box with no condiments. Expensive, poor service and bland. For an upmarket hotel I expected a LOT better and would 100% NOT recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaHFxU2p3RRAB,Really underwhelming
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLU9LV2tnRRAB,"Part of the Stamford Hotel. It was a contrast because I liked the hotel, but this place was lifeless like a bad joke."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OExTanlnRRAB,Stopped in for a G&T. The Jungle theme didn't really deliver! But nice service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPak1fcG5RRRAB,Very delicious cocktails that were reasonably priced! The bartender was very friendly and was happy to make what ever I was after! The venue isn‚Äôt too bad but nothing special! Sadly there was a mouse trying to attack me which kind of ruined the moment but overall not too bad!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya2NXRHJnRRAB,"Bottomless gin was good but music was horrific, think they compiled a play list of all the worst covers ever made and played it on repeat"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnZ6U1JREAE,"My family came and stayed at the Stamford Hotel for the Easter weekend and Harry's Jungle was next door. I cannot recommend the bar manager, Kate, as a star employee more highly. She really made my family's stay at the hotel memorable, personable and fun! She is an amazing mixologist and a great bar tender. I hear that she is moving on to another bar soon, and I truly feel bad for your loss as this girl deserves a pay rise. The bar itself is fun, the hotel memorable, but Kate really made our stay worthwhile. Would strongly recommend the $39 all you can drink cocktails for large groups of friends and for functions!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXYtMHlRRRAB,"I used to come here with friends years ago. I had fantastic memories of this place: busy and great vibe, packed with people cheerfully chatting, drinking and eating after work on Fridays. I am finally back here to catch up with a friend who works nearby. Thrilled to find the Happy Hour drinks are still delicious and affordable, as well as friendly and speedy service (thank you Marvin for your friendly and professional service). It was a bonus to still get complimentary nibbles. The only thing missing is the crowd: well it is only Tuesday... I know, right? üòÜ Nothing wrong to have an after-work drink early in the week to support your local businesses. üòú I really had a great time üòÉ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcTgzcTRRRRAB,Aways enjoy sitting outside enjoying the food and cocktails. Staff are all lovely.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNC16cldnEAE,Outrageous price for poor standard of food. The fact that my official complaint to the Stamford plaza has been ignored suggests a lack of interest in their business.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNDlPdVBBEAE,They offer good value daily specials but the service has gone down of late with increased waiting times. I waited 40 mins for my meal.  Not recommended
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVX3NLcGZ3EAE,Clean and friendly atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVMU5lZmx3RRAB,"Great food, seated without wait. Highly Recommended"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4alBMS1lnEAE,WOW WOW WOW! My partner and I had been craving some ribs and found this place to be the best from other reviews and it was better than expected! All the staff were so attentive and nice and made the whole experience so seamless. Entrees were fresh and delicious and we could barely even speak to each other while eating the ribs they were that good! Chips were also the perfect crunch on the outside fluffy on the inside. I was tempted but just way too full from the mains to have dessert but I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve been just as perfect. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better night ü•∞

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWRLZUZ3EAE,"James our server/host was all smiles throughout the evening and contributed to a relaxed atmosphere. We ordered steak, ribs, onion fries, oysters Kilpatrick and as a lovely surprise were served a complimentary ice cream for my husband's birthday. While on the pricey side, we found it worth every cent..this is a great restaurant for a special event."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanZXWld3EAE,My only issue was I got lost trying to find the place. I made a call and the waitress actually came out on to the road to wave me down and escort me to the venue. The exceptional service continued from there and all meals were stunning. Can‚Äôt wait to return and share the experience with our friends.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXBDUkx3EAE,"Entrees were great, service was fantastic, restaurant awesome, cocktails were good but the steaks were really undercooked and not worth the hype.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUpxbE1nEAE,"Beautiful steaks, restaurant and staff! Highly recommend, we couldn‚Äôt fault the experience. We love Rare and are regulars to the restaurants. Each time the experience is seamless, and fairly priced with good portion sizes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE9UZzVRRRAB,Went for my wife's 60th birthday. Food and drinks were delicious and the service was superb. Very attentive without being too full on. Would thoroughly recommend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0o2cS1BRRAB,"Gab my name, I know why is called reare stake because that‚Äôs the place to get smaller stake, don‚Äôt go there if u are hungry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNV82d2t3RRAB,"Came here as I was craving some steak and visiting melb at the time (from syd). This steak house was amazing, so tasty and service was immaculate. Prices are alright especially considering the service and steaks are never going to be cheap! Creme brulee was too die for. Also ur welcome to set up shop in Sydney ;)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc19ienF3RRAB,Great food and service. !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzVuaC1RRRAB,Excellent customer service and fantastic place to meet up with friends.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeFpLb3N3RRAB,"The steak was good but not phenomenal, and so was the kangaroo tartare. The sticky date pudding was delicious! The staff were very nice but the place was a bit too noisy for our taste. A good experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWF1MnRRRRAB,Amazing service and steaks were cooked perfectly
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mko2ekl3EAE,I guess you need to like Mexican food to really enjoy this place! Found is all a little meh but that is possibly a little harsh. No-one did anything wrong - except my first 2 choices of beer were not available.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDlqQ3p3RRAB,One if the best Mexican restaurant I have been to . Amazing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZy03TEdREAE,"Every dish is delicious! The doneness of the main course was perfect! The service is also very good! When you come to Melbourne, you must come to this Mexican restaurantüëçüèªüëçüèª"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1lfZ3NRRRAB,Really great food! Will definitely be returning.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2MydzhBRRAB,"Good vibes, yummy food and exceptional margaritas (a must try). Great for people who are gluten free! I would order the tuna p√¢t√© over the guac - it's delicious.  Tacos could do with some flavour improvement (a bit bland and underwhelming), but everything else is tasty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWZmSHVRRRAB,The Margarita here is the best in a hundred miles üòç The food is great~ The atmosphere is very goodüëç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenZULWxRRRAB,"Mamasita is a solid Mexican restaurant. We enjoyed our meal and the cocktails. The tuna starter was nice but nothing to rave about, the tortilla chips with guac was good too but again not blow your socks off. We enjoyed the fish tacos and the pork belly main, again nice but similarly not the best I've ever had either.  Service was prompt and friendly. Please note that the table bookings are 1.5 hrs and they ensure you stick to it. Again that's fair enough but if you want a longer sitting ensure you ask."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanZmRmpnRRAB,"Guacamole to die for, amazing vegan selections and some awesome meat dishes, too!  We went hear before a show and the team were super accommodating asking how long we had to dine and made sure we were taken care of.  Special mention was to the ox tongue tacos which were fantastic with the addition of the green jalapeno hot sauce."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHNHUVR3EAE,"Good food and service, but a bit expensive for what they serve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnA3VjVnRRAB,Bit overrated in my opinion. Nothing like authentic Mexican food. They're going for more sort of  contemporary and fine dining experience if I may say so. Lamb birria was average!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkpxSFRREAE,"The worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been. I'm from Mexico City and I've been in Australia 7 years so of course I don't expect much or the real Mexican food, but this was really bad. The taste of the dishes was mediocre and portions too small. Very overrated place. The ceviche has absolutely no flavour, how can you ruin a ceviche?!  I was here in 2015 then 2019 then March this year 2023 , all by invitation and all I can say is try any other Mexican restaurant in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUpPQjVBRRAB,"We were made to order the banquet as we were a group of 8. Pretty disappointed as it meant we had little to no choice in what we were served, and when you multiple the pp cost by 8, it's actually pretty expensive for what you get. I don't understand why they're so firm on that, I just want to choose what I'm paying for.  The guac was basically smashed avo with some seeds on top. No taste of lime, no traces of onion, and I counted two tiny pieces of tomato. Ceviche didn't have enough lime juice either.  It's also frustrating when you're paying the bill to get handed an eftpos machine with 3 main options of 'how much would you like to tip?. You have to navigate out to select nothing. Why is there a culture of tipping when the staff should be being paid fairly. This isn't America, and it's not fine dining where the staff are going above and beyond.  So many better Mexican restaurants in Melbourne."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbzY3LUFnEAE,"how i found this restaurant today was a bit unfortunate (basically was trying to kill some time before heading to RVEEH) but what a find !!  i saw the prices and thought it was a bit much but was so hungry and i didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôll find another place that would be open on easter sunday so i went up.  we ordered the corn, fish tacos, pork belly, and corn chips with a black bean dip (?). the pork belly was $44 which is a lot HOWEVER was it to die for. my partner wanted it and i said sure, i‚Äôm not the biggest fan of pork i kind of fell out of love with it but i can eat mamasita‚Äôs pork main everyday. crispy pork skin but the meat was so juicy and soft i could not get over it.  my only gripe was the fish tacos. yeah, it was good but i think 18$ for the two was a bit much. i‚Äôve had similar quality for 10$ for two.  i do want to shout out the service though. the waitress serving us was super nice and explained the menu very clearly. i asked if they had any mocktail and recommend the virgin mojito which is apparently a secret menu ! she looked after us very well and told us about the lady on the wall ! so shout out to her !!  surcharge was crazy but not including that it was $120 for two ppl including drinks (i did have a mocktail so maybe 1.5 drinks). i think pricing was reasonable enough.  tldr: pork is worth 44$"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmI3VUt3EAE,"Visitor from Sydney here, visiting Melbourne quite often but usually have something quick and easy around Swanston/Flinders.  This time, decided to try this restaurant as many guide suggested and I feel I should try something that ‚ÄúMelbournian‚Äù have. Also, a great Mexican food should bring me back a good memory when I was in Cancun many years ago.  Sat at the bar as I came alone and really want to keep the table for a bigger party.  The staff were lovely and service was good although a bit annoying as two ladies sat beside me seem to chatting and playing with staffs most of the time, fair enough, they might be friend with them, or, they might be extrovert and socialise people which the bar is well accomodate them.  However, I feel like I wasn‚Äôt taken care well enough even though I just came here for a ‚Äúnice‚Äù dinner, not sure if other customers at the bar feel the same or not. Also, the music quite loud which makes communication a bit struggle.  Then the food, here we come, the reasons for one star.  The menu wasn‚Äôt catered very well for non Mexican experts, come with various jargons and Spanish words. This might be good for upscaling the restaurant but it‚Äôs quite confusing and really have no idea how the food is (PS. English is my second language, it might be OK for others, I don‚Äôt know)  The food quantity is not that worth for the price tag. Your guys are a rip off. I feel like I have been scammed.  18 bucks for 2 very tiny tacos, 15 bucks for 2 very tiny wrap of grilled squid (?? I don‚Äôt know how to call as the menu issue, already mentioned), and 7 bucks for a tiny bowl of prickles and assortments. My initial plan to enjoy the nice meal here is over and I need to have some pizzas around Swanston Street after that to fill my stomach.  Anyway, the drink is OK and worth the price. The coconut milk with cinnamon is a good match and taste really great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmNtV2NREAE,"Amazing food! Made sure that all my intolerances were looked after in a serious way, the food was amazing and the drinks were Devine! Will be recommending to anyone who needs to eat in the city!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWVQNXlRRRAB,Our dinner was short but sweet! Literally mouth-watering tacos and that Yuzu Marg is to absolutely die for. Amazing service as well and such a beautiful vibe for a date night!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmM2WXJBRRAB,"Incredibly disappointing. The taste of the dishes was extremely mediocre and portions were small. Very overrated place. The ceviche was disgraceful. I'm no expert but that's nothing like the dozen or so ceviches I've had before. 4 slices of fish in a red pink sauce. See image attached. Ordered 5 dishes,  none of which were mains, and four drinks and the total was $256. The drinks were decent but overpriced as well. $30 for an old fashion. Will never return or recommend. If you want better flavours, atmosphere and prices,  head to Harley and Rose."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2J6SFNnEAE,"Family of 5 here we took our daughter here for her birthday Food tasted ok  but the servings are so tiny it‚Äôs not funny I ordered the steak burritos very small amount of meat and they give you about 3 tiny little tortillas wasn‚Äôt enough for the small amount of meat my kids could not stop laughing at how small there burritos were I have noticed other reviews on here have said the same thing about how tiny the meals are maybe start listening to your customers and increase the serving sizes we went hungry as a family and after spending over $300 we all left hungry, we had to stop at McDonalds on the way home"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnF2Qkh3EAE,First time here and service was outstanding. Waitress was happy to spend time to explain the drinks and food. Food and drinks were lovely - we had banquet $69 and 2 cocktails each and was enough for us. Would love to go back again sometime.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnNtRFBBEAE,"Generally it's a cool venue and the food is good.  However, we booked a table for 3 people, once we go there we were sat down and our food and drink order was taken and the staff were very friendly, however that's where the good experience ends.  We ordered the $69pp banquet set meal. The wait between courses was absolutely unacceptable, at one stage we waited over ONE HOUR between courses.  When we asked if our order had been forgotten were told that our next course would be ""five minutes at most"" - already tired and a bit miffed I started a timer on my watch - it took 23 minutes.  This was a recurring theme, we were sitting down for 110 minutes before we managed to get our main.  Then another lengthy wait for our desert was not what was on the set menu we ordered.  We were offered a free jug of sangria, but one of the 3 of us was pregnant and at this point we had been there for over 2 hours and had to get up at 4am the next morning to get a flight.  To top it off, there is a mandatory 10% surcharge on Sundays, which is usually totally fine, but it was quite a sour thing to pay when you have such an awful dining experience.  All in all, this place has loads of potential, and I'm sure is usually fine as we got it as a recommendation from a friend who said they had a good time here - but our experience was a completely unacceptable dining experience and no amount of ""Sorry it'll be out in a second"" every 5 minutes for 2 hours can make that feel any better. Unsure where the problem lay, but as a customer, this was unfortunately one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time.  The food was very good, but based on our whole experience I would not recommend this establishment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3N5MEdBEAE,The food was nice and the staff were attentive but the food was so slow! Over 3 hours for our dinner and an hour between courses. I was embarrassed to have suggested it for our group dinner.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXVyYVlBEAE,"This review is from our visit in early February. I usually love Mexican food, but somehow did not like the food here very much. Not very flavourful or fresh. But the one thing I absolutely loved was the mushroom tostaditas! So good! However the service was great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ckp5dkl3EAE,"Great view, great service, great food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSal9hUG13RRAB,"Regularly go to this place.  The service is always great,  good is amazing and the views create a nice ambiance.   Great place to take that special person.   Meet and relax in the bar outside the restaurant"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDVuSl9BRRAB,"Visited this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Beautiful views, excellent customer service and top of the world food. Amazed with details and the how well the flavours are complementing each other! Tortellini and veggie bao for entree are top notch followed by chicken breast, veggie main and date pudding, creme brulee! Definitely worth every $$$ and Thank You chef and entire team for such a great experience. We'll be back again!! Our section waiter Will, you're a gem and making this restaurant shine brighter! Great work"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOF9yNVBnEAE,We have lived a culinary experience! Thank you so much to the Chef and the team ! Also the hostess was super friendly and helpful! Thanks again !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScVpHOFV3EAE,"Will is the most amazing waiter I have ever met in my life and I traveled all around the world! He made our experience more than amazing and we will always remember him. Thank you for making our date night the loveliest! ‚ù§Ô∏è  The other waiters were also very nice and friendly!  The food was also amazing, it was so tasty and I consider myself a picky eater (I am French) haha  Beautiful view, great ambiance, great prices 100% recommend the place! Enjoy! ‚ú®"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcHRQTXhnRRAB,"we dined here on a thursday night. The waiter was very professional and knowledgeable.  we asked for a table beside a window. beautiful view of the city at night. prices are on the high side, but the food, service and view is amazing. i'd go again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScGNMOVBnEAE,A fantastic experience with amazing views. The food was beautiful and waiters were all lovely. I would recommend for all special occasions. Only issue is it is a bit hard to find if you haven‚Äôt be there before.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWJhYU1REAE,Our Daughters 21st the food was excellent so was the service made the day memorable.Fab View!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNllQNlJ3EAE,"Lovely meal, very high standard and with exceptional service from will."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGVPX19RRRAB,"We stayed at Sofitel Melbourne and dined as a family of 3 at No. 35 on 30 March to have an earlier evening. Beyond the beautiful sunset views of the city, we found the food and drinks to be enjoyable and elegantly plated. While one or two dishes were slightly over-salted for our taste, we found this to be the case for most restaurants in the city.  We were served by Ashley, who was courteous and warm to our daughter. The general manager at the front of the house was a cut above the others, and fully attentive to the varied needs of each table. For example, she noticed that we were sharing the entrees and proactively brought us sharing plates. Our water glasses were also refilled so smoothly that we didn‚Äôt notice anyone doing it. Would recommend No35 for a pleasant dining experience in the city."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnJyVFVBEAE,"I went to No35 for the first time with my friend and we were looked after by a lovely gentleman named Will. Will was so kind, knowledgeable, accommodating and hilarious! He truely made our experience worth while and a night to remember. We started with wines and not being a wine drinker like myself I was overwhelmed by the choices. Not only did Will narrow it down for us, he also recommended the best tasting ones and his favourite ones which did not disappoint at all! He was engaging in conversation with us and didn't treat us like customers, he personalised the experience as if we were old friends having a chat. Will's food recommendations were absolutely spot on and we'd be absolutely lost without his impeccable customer service and recommendations. He is an absolute asset to the team and if you ever get to eat at this gorgeous restaurant, please request for Will. I can't give him a more glowing recommendation, I will be back again in the hopes to be served by this lovely man. Please give Will a raise, or at least acknowledge him for the amount of care he provides for the work he does. It's rare to come across the customer service Will has provided. Thank you so much again Will! much love from your favourite chismosa xx"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXYzb1RnEAE,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at no.35 restaurant and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The restaurant boasts an inviting atmosphere and the service was top-notch.  My partner and I were celebrating our 2nd Year anniversary. As frequent diners, we've been to many restaurants, but no.35 definitely stood out in terms of food and ambience. However, it was Will's (the waiter) service that made our experience just that cherry on top.  We opted for the 3 set course and Will was very knowledgeable in recommending popular dishes. Each dish we ordered was outstanding. The warm chocolate fondant dessert was a highlight and perfect for any sweet tooth.  Overall, I would highly recommend no.35 to anyone looking for a superb dining experience with exceptional service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXBhZHRBRRAB,"A wonderful evening in a delightful venue. The city lights are outstanding! The food was excellent and Will, our waiter, was nothing short of pleasant, friendly and welcoming. His smile and humour made our evening together celebrating a birthday even more special."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXBxZFBnEAE,The food and service was amazing! A special thanks to Will who looked after us and made our anniversary night extra special!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNXVfS19nRRAB,"We spent the evening at No35 for my wife's birthday.  Our waiter was Will a young enthusiastic and extremely polite young man who was an absolute delight to have serve our table. He attended our every need and was kind enough to organise a small plate with happy birthday written on it.  Truly above and beyond üôè. The food was fantastic, everything was cooked to perfection and the desert was out of this world. With Will assisting us on becoming Accor members we most definitely be returning and recommending this fine (breathless view) stablishment. Thank you Will and No35 for a fabulous evening."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc3VUaTFRRRAB,Fantastic customer service from the waiters Exceptional quality food I have been a few times bringing new guests who also enjoyed the meals and the service and amazing  views!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3JUVkhREAE,Highly recommend No35 as a place to celebrate specials events! Dishes are  delicious and atmosphere here is great. 5 stars for Will:))His service is excellent. He is so sweet! I had a really memorable  birthday night.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEtUMUF3EAE,"No35 is located in a high-rise building with an excellent city view, which creates a unique and enjoyable dining experience.  The view from the restaurant is simply stunning, with a panoramic view of the city that adds to the already beautiful interior.  The menu at No35 is diverse, and the dishes are carefully crafted and beautifully presented. Every dish we ordered was delicious and prepared to perfection. The quality of the ingredients used is evident in every bite, and the flavors are well-balanced and enjoyable. The wine list is also extensive and offers a wide range of choices that complement the food perfectly.  The standout feature of No35 is undoubtedly the service. Our waiter, Will, was exceptional. He was attentive and charming and made our anniversary day truly memorable. Will made us feel welcome and comfortable, and his recommendations were spot on."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLTZMYXRBRRAB,"The restaurant is certainly back to 5 star service, it‚Äôs an enjoyable experience, great view of Melbourne and amazing food and great selection of wine.  If you want something different try the popcorn Expresso martini."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NTg2eXV3RRAB,Absolutely incredible
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczctczV3RRAB,"The most extraordinary breakfast experience in Melbourne; you can enjoy a fabulous view over the city and the river from 35 stories up whilst breakfasting on a sumptuous hot and cold buffet, with dishes like eggs benedict and omelettes made specially to your order. The service is wonderful too; legends like Alice, who's worked for the Sofitel for some 30 years, are always on hand with kindness and consideration to make sure that you start the day in the very best way possible!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmVMOUp3EAE,High tea with resplendent views of Melbourne and a pianist was the perfect way to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day. At $90pp plus cc surcharge it‚Äôs definitely at the highest end of Melbourne‚Äôs high tea offerings but we enjoyed the experience. The savouries were pedestrian but the pastry chef impressed and the scones were the best I‚Äôve had in some time. Deliciously light and fluffy. Side note do visit the bathroom before departure. The view is sensational not to mention the sublime Balmain hand wash
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGZHdmJ3EAE,Delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3FqTURBEAE,"10 stars. The best fine dining in Melbourne an unbeatable experience, food, views and service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodHZILThBRRAB,Absolutely lovely!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzRyQWJnEAE,"Exceptional. Simple food served quickly for those of us going onto evening events but somehow not rushed and we got the impression we could have lingered all night if we'd had the time. Down to earth, but knowledgeable service and the anchovy toasts were some of the best food we have eaten this year. Yum. Only downside was that sitting at the bar meant we got bumped a fair bit but that's a very minor point."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMTdxTXpnRRAB,"I had rabbit mushroom risotto, a wet rice dish which was creamy, mushroom, yummy with chunks of rabbit in it with a $21 Spanish wine which was paired very well with the dish. Tip for person in charge, do make single diners more welcome."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDg3T3VRRRAB,We originally booked inside but upon arriving we asked if we could sit outside as it was milder than we anticipated. They were most obliging and quickly set a table by the heater for us. Service was super friendly and efficient and the food certainly lived up to our expectations. We loved sitting out in the bustle of Little Collins St.  The wines matched beautifully with the various plates we ordered. We cannot wait to return and order the plates we didn't try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnVlZGp3RRAB,Great food and great service ~ best place to hang out
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXVMWGNnEAE,Great wine and desserts. Going to come back for a full dinner experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd29ld1BREAE,Overrated Spanish food. Menu is not rich. Description of food is not clear. Food presentation is not nice. Toilets are clean. Waiters are polite.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX0xEMjFBRRAB,The food is great~ The original menu is in Portuguese~ The Mediterranean Iberian flavor is biased towards üáµüáπtapas~ It is worth coming again~ Great atmosphere~ Cozy bistro
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDgyMmJREAE,"Very disappointing. Staff is not helpful. Would not want to share the available wifi and when I cancel the order to head back to the hotel, tried to charge me for it even though I canceled. Felt like being taken advantage of, rather than welcome. if you are looking for a nice dinner dinner Sheraton while on a work trip trying to get some reading done with tablet and a dead mobile phone, look elsewhere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWFISTRRRRAB,"What a wonderful place. Feeling like a European wine bar, Bar Lourinha did not disappoint our group of five friends on a busy Friday evening in Melbourne. The small and large share plates suited us perfectly from the tangy lime and chillie oyster, the beautiful wagyu beef skewers and the amazing pomegranate crema with honeycomb. Washed down with a delicious bottle of red (or maybe two) all topped off by perfect service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2Rud293RRAB,"Good food, friendly people but just lacked a sense of atmosphere for lunch. May be better in the evening."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeHF5M1hREAE,"Loved this spot!! Service was great and the food even better. Loved trying out a number of the dishes (great to come in a group of 4) with the standouts anchovy on bread tapas (special), scallop and pork cheek pintxo and Portuguese duck on rice. The Bolinho de bacalhau (cod croquette) was also pretty good along with the squid. Will have to come back and check out the rest!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXBmYVJ3EAE,"Think twice if you have allergies!  I'm anaphylactic to sesame (seeds and oil).  We were at Bar Lourinha for a catch up with girlfriends from Sydney - some I hadn't seen in over 20 years!  I asked the servers twice if there was any sesame and I was told very confidently that there was no sesame in any of the dishes we had ordered.  I had a reaction straight away so I asked again and was told again that there was definitely no sesame in our food.  I finally asked if there was perhaps tahini in a dish and was then advised that yes, they had added a little bit of tahini in one of our dishes.  Not once did any of the servers, or the chef register that tahini is pure sesame!  That is like forgetting that there is peanuts in peanut butter!  Needless to say, I was left cradling a bucket with a very nervous uber driver but at least my friends got a free meal out of it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocjVDVm1nRRAB,The service was exceptional. We had a private gathering upstairs and they keep the bar open after hours just for us. Never experienced this at such a high demand bar before.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoODVhc3VnRRAB,"All time favourite Melb food safari destination. Beautiful flavours, friendly staff and delicious wines."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa3N2aEhBEAE,Great food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa3BYU3RRRRAB,"Delicious tapas. Buzzy vibe. Friendly staff, experts on recommending number of dishes. Great wine selection by glass. Dessert full of intense flavours, finishing off with Spanish Sherry. Bravo."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocktYR2h3RRAB,Spanish style food bar with tapas and raciones! Food is delicious and friendly staff!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaS1Yem93RRAB,Here the food is Spanish Tapas or more specifically Catalan cuisine. So expect many small dishes served in quick succession. It is a small restaurant but what it lacks in size is more than made up with an atmosphere that is unpretentious. You get the impression that the staff like working there as it reflects on what the customer sees - Friendly faces. I will return many times. Highly recommend
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOWMycXdnRRAB,"We had a wonderful New Year's Eve meal at this fantastic intimate eatery to see out 2022. A set menu, including a glass of bubbles (not the cheap stuff either), made it nice and easy for us. Everyone working there did so with a smile on their faces & made us feel special - a big tick in my book. The wine list is extensive and the food was sublime - my favourite was the spiced spanner crab tostado & my husband's was the soft shell prawns. We loved all the knick knacks adorning the walls - a nice reminder of times we spent in both Spain & Portugal back in 2018, and the live singer/musician towards the end of the night added to the ambiance. Thank you to the staff of Bar Lourinha - Happy New Year to you!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbllhcElREAE,"Lovely lunch with a client, set menu - 150$ was very nice"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRM1A3eHRRRRAB,Very tasty food. Great cosy setting with knowledgeable and helpful staff. Will be coming back.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOXBpdmJREAE,"Just had their 8 course Christmas lunch. What a joy! Fabulous food, meticulously planned menu, waitstaff unstinting in their attention and food delivery. Could not fault it and will be back next year."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteDhYbVlREAE,Shoutout to Stephen for going above and beyond.  Appetisers and entr√©es were incredible. Mains were alright. Cocktails were good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMDk2Sl93RRAB,"The restaurant for the Sheraton Melbourne. Pretty solid kitchen that also does the rooms service and the hotel breakfast. Burgers are really good and the salt and pepper squid was also a solid choice. Buffet breakfast is the usual hotel offering with hot food buffet, pastries and fruit. Eggs made to order including omelet. Staff are friendly and efficient"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN2VQM3dBRRAB,Food was great and enue was great too. The staff who served us was very helpful and tries to givee 110% all the time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN0xHY29RRRAB,Comfortable night in
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ODhyNTRRRRAB,"Fantastic service, small menu but great choice. Also cater for vegetarians great drinks at reasonable price. Over all it was a great night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMl9uaGd3RRAB,"This Little Collins St Kitchen has changed since someday before after COVID19.  Dine-in menu for dinner is now pretty simpler as there is no longer fancy buffet run for dinner, nevertheless quality of shucked oysters with caviars is pretty good and worth paying for.  Wagyu hamburger for the lunch menu was good and worth paying for as it was still better quality than Hungry Jack.  Coffee in this hotel is not worth paying for as coffee beans do not look fresh nor aromatic flavor.  Downside is; 1. This restaurant and cafe does not have local beers(Melbourne one) 2. A glass of Moet Champagne costs $24, while there was no refreshing bubbles left in a glass. 3. The worst part is that staffs in the bar has no idea why patrons and guests are paying for $24 in the bar instead of buying this bottle of Champagne $60 in the bottle-shop. And they insisted that freshness of Champagne is still good although a bottle was opened for a day, maybe morning or afternoon they do not remember anything.  Overall I was satisfied with cook in this restaurant, but not recommended for Bar and dinner if you may look for better and quality of food and unless staying at this Hotel including breakfast is a package option. There are plenty of better restaurants near this hotel."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc2V1bEVBEAE,"Immaculate service, extremely friendly waiter, the food was very nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMzhlTldREAE,Had organised a high tea for a hens party. Ricky the manager was so great to deal with and all the staff were friendly. They were so flexible and accommodating too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdmFhVDBRRRAB,Had a fine dining experience. All the dishes we tried had a unique flavours. Staff also really friendly and helpfull. Highly recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHLXNyV3NRRRAB,Amazing service and delicious food! Definitely recommend this place if you want high quality meals and a calm atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhM056Zjd3RRAB,"Nice food, good atmosphere, great staff.  Great for a special occasion.  It's OK at the moment due to the limited menu.  I'm really looking forward to the full menu being back on offer when COVID is controlled better.  Best was to come here is via public transport or taxi/uber as parking can be expensive/nightmare."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMEtPa1dREAE,Yummy pasta
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdWJXNlV3EAE,"A nice little restaurant located in the Melbourne Sheraton Hotel.  The food dishes were delicious, but I would like to see more seafood options. The seafood quality was fresh and delicious though.  The desserts were amazing!! That was my favourite part of the dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNmJDWE1nEAE,Service was  brilliant.  Food exquisite.  Made our birthdays  very special
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzODhEYW53RRAB,"Pretty good seafood buffet.  While the buffet isn't very big, it does offer better quality of dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrc08yNXdnRRAB,"I was reading all the reviews online and hesitated to make a booking for my wedding party. I‚Äôm glad I decided to try for myself. First the service was amazing! I booked in advanced and pre-ordered a la carte menu. It was a breeze dealing with all their staffs. They communicated to each other well so I didn‚Äôt have to explain to every single one of them every time I contacted them. They were able to accommodate my request in advanced to arrive at 11.30, which would be earlier than their usual lunch hours at 12 pm to have refreshments. I was originally told that we could wait at the lounge seating at the front of the restaurant, which was fine but people would be walking around us. Again, I wasn‚Äôt fuzzy about this. But when we arrived today very early at 11 am, we were seated in a very private area that was reserved for our party next to the bar on those comfortable chairs. Unexpected and wonderful experience! It was intimate space and away from all the restaurant patrons. For refreshments, we had coffee and tea with those Buttermilk Fried Chicken sliders and Baked Camembert with herb and garlic butter along with toast. Those were great and such a hit with all my guests.  When we were seated at 12 for lunch, we were well taken care by staffs. Alison was knowledgeable with the wine selection. Love the Australian sparkling wine she recommended. When the food arrived, the portion was not at all what I expected. It was huge portion. Calamari was tender. Mushroom risotto was very good according to my husband. I had salmon for entree. Perfectly cooked with red curry butter sauce to spice it up. It‚Äôs not spicy but definitely something different that I would order again. The steak was beautiful and everyone enjoyed the meal.  I particularly love my strawberry macaron! Delicious and fresh to clean my palette after the fish. The dark chocolate hazelnut fondant was nice and warm. The richness of chocolate was satisfying especially to go with rum raisin ice cream.  Overall excellent service and amazing food. Definitely memorable experience for our special day. I will recommend to anyone looking for cosy and comfortable ambience with great food and five-star service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNLU5Dd3pRRRAB,Very relaxing atmosphere and food was delicious.  Excellent customer service as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNks3REdREAE,"Went there with 3 friends for a Saturday seafood buffet with our Groupon vouchers. Only had 2 staffs on the floor serving everyone. Staffs kept forgetting to clear our tables (as we had oyster and prawn shells in bowls) or bring us water. To be honest it was not their fault because I think the place was understaffed. Towards the end when it was quieter, staffs were really nice to tell us that the buffet was coming to an end and we should grab our desserts. Food wise I think the crab didn‚Äôt taste too fresh but everything else was great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNOEx2dmVREAE,"Seafood buffet has good quality seafood, fair variety of seafood. Buffet in general is quite small with average quality mains. Cosy atmosphere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M0tlMlJREAE,"Service good. Food ok. If you go here, the corn is amazing!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek5HR1lBEAE,"Staff are some of the friendliest I have come across! Fun space where you can people watch from the balcony. The food was delicious, particularly the Pork Hock! Decked out in Asian fusion decor üòç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN19LQUpBEAE,"Great little find late on a cold rainy night in Melbourne. Lots of interesting and tasty bits and pieces on the menu and probably the best beef pho I've had in my belly. Service friendly, warm and attentive. Not the easiest place to find signage wise but worth the explore"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3V5UUZBEAE,"The food as well as the atmosphere here is amazing. We asked for a quick lunch and they gave us a quick lunch, with 2 bowls of pho ready in minutes.  There is such a calm environment and the staff are very friendly.  I would definitely come here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjRyUEN3EAE,The food is good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnBDcUFREAE,"Banquet menu not worth it. Had the Uncle Knows Best menu & it felt like they just serve you their cheapest dishes for $64pp.  It started with the lime cured hapuka and coconut on betel leaf which was so mild and lacking in flavour. The aftertaste was just fishy & in want of acidity.  The other starters were quite tasty: edamame was nice but is literally just salty grilled beans. The grilled corn was also done really well but ‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs just corn? The crispy chicken bao with pickles was the tastiest dish from the entire banquet & balanced sweet & salty well.  The mains were the let down. First of all‚Ä¶ fries? This didn‚Äôt complement the meal & the Szechuan salt was unidentifiable. The fish curry tasted like a bowl of warm milky coconut soup. The potato & bean curd puffs were just starchy & there wasn‚Äôt enough texture or taste.  Quantity: They gave us 1 bowl of rice to share between 3 people and 1 plate of steak between 5-6 which worked out as one slice per person‚Ä¶ definitely feeling a bit scammed here.  Vibe: nice set up & decor, nice toilets (unisex), with hand towelettes.  I won‚Äôt be back & am surprised by the high google ratings. I‚Äôd rather book at Rice Paper Scissors or Ho Chi Mama for contemporary Asian flavours done well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmRMZzZ3RRAB,"Stepping into Uncle we were warmly and genuinely welcomed by all the staff.   Clearly they love working here.  The food was fresh and clean,  with the best of ingredients presenting us with hot,  umani, crisp and balanced combinations.    Best meal we've had in Melbourne"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek1fNFZREAE,"Love this place ‚ù§ delicious food and staff asked if we're on lunch break and need speedy service, very considerate. Great friendly and happy staff, feels like being in Vietnam- upstairs and lots of light."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdDdYTjNRRRAB,Considerate service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcXNha3JnRRAB,"Good food, good service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeXRyaktnEAE,"We had a delightful experience. Absolutely loved the food. If you are looking for comfort soul food look no further, paired with amazing cocktails.  Most importantly, impeccable service from the staff. Would go back again & again !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa3ZUS0VnEAE,"I had the displeasure of dining at Uncle yesterday for a team lunch. Unfortunately some of my team were struck down with COVID so of the 8 we booked for only 3 of us were able to attend. Upon arrival we explained the situation to the Manager and he said (in an arrogant manner) that we would be charged a no show fee of $64 per person that didn‚Äôt attend. He mentioned it was stated in the terms and conditions in the booking confirmation email (which they were not). The website also doesn‚Äôt mention anything about a fee when part of the group can‚Äôt attend. To avoid the fee I arranged for 3 additional colleagues to attend given the office is nearby. Therefore there were 6 of us.  We went to order the $35 lunchtime quickie but were informed that Uncle weren‚Äôt serving the lunchtime quickie during December. I was told that this information ‚Äòshould have been outlined in the confirmation email‚Äô (it wasn‚Äôt). I pointed out that the hard copy menu didn‚Äôt have a note or sticker or anything to indicate that the lunchtime quickie wasn‚Äôt available and nor did the website have any wording to indicate it wasn‚Äôt available (it is still listed on the website menu).  Our group then went to order a la carte and were told we were not allowed to order a la carte as we were in a group. I mentioned that the website doesn‚Äôt have a requirement that groups can‚Äôt order a la carte at lunch - direct quote from the website ‚ÄúA La Carte menu available at lunch and for groups less than 8 at dinner‚Äù. To clarify, we were dining at lunch (12:30PM).  The website also states: ‚ÄúWe require all groups of 10 or more at lunch to dine from either our ‚ÄòLunchtime Quickie‚Äô or ‚ÄòUncle Knows Best‚Äô banquets. Groups of 8 or more in the evenings are required to dine from either our ‚ÄòUncle Knows Best‚Äô banquets‚Äù.  The website further states: ‚ÄúWe require all dinner reservations of 8 or more to partake in either our $64pp or $80pp banquet‚Äù.  To clarify, there were 6 of us and it was lunch so I don‚Äôt understand how Uncle can justify forcing us to order from the Uncle Knows Best banquet. Even if they were enforcing that our booking was for 8 it wouldn‚Äôt justify it according to their own words on the website (there were less than 10 of us and it wasn‚Äôt an evening booking, it was a lunch booking).  I was then passed to a Manager (the same one from the start).  I explained the situation to the Manager outlining all the facts. The Manager was unable to justify why both the hard copy menu and the online website (and online menu) had no wording to support the $64pp no show fee, nor that the lunchtime quickie was unavailable, nor that we were not allowed to order a la carte when in a group. The Manager was adamant that all the information was outlined in a booking confirmation email. I showed him the confirmation email we received and he then went to get his computer to supposedly show the confirmation email. When he eventually returned, what he showed me was not a confirmation email (it was essentially some manually typed shorthand notes in their system).  As a ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù the Manager said he would waive the two no show fees (which again appear to be made up fees that we weren‚Äôt told of beforehand or could find no mention of on the website). Also given we had 6 out of 8 ppl there and were ordering takeaway for a 7th it would‚Äôve been a bit rich to still charge us a no show fee, so the gesture was nothing but an empty gesture.  At this point it was getting late and it was clear that the restaurant had an agenda to give us no option other than to order the $64pp menu and given our credit card was on file we begrudgingly accepted.  In terms of the food, the best way to describe it would be ok but not great. I‚Äôve had worse but I‚Äôve also had better, much better. The quantity of food was also not great.  I dine out a lot in and around Melbourne and have never had such an unpleasant experience at a restaurant before. Safe to say that the people I know won‚Äôt be going back. In my opinion there are much better options out there in the CBD with much better customer service so diners beware!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbTZIeWt3RRAB,Good service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdXVQb013EAE,"Wonderful food,  wonderful place. Highly recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOG9fYk1REAE,"Great food and atmosphere but the whole experience was made special by Shannon. Impeccable service and genuine interest in our visit to Melbourne really made an already great dinner, fantastic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldGRTVy13RRAB,"Went here for a quick pho run, was extremely delighted by how well trained the staff was. Our waiter was extremely friendly, and attended to all our needs. Pho‚Äôs beef was delicious: tender and full of flavor, with a reasonable price too.  Although this place seems to project itself as a semi bar that sells small bites, the food and service will not disappoint."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaGR2YktBEAE,"The food was divine and im glad i changed the set feast option from spring rolls to soft shell crab.  The drinks were all right and service was great.  However, quite discerning i received an email from management saying the bill wasnt processed yet my friend said the bill was processed on their end. Who do i believe?  They have my credit card details due the booking so they may debit what owing anyway."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMllXSlV3EAE,"Great meal, incredible staff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla2NDX193RRAB,Wow what an awesome experience and the food to match!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlckxDUUl3EAE,"Great food, but the service and attention to detail were very much the champions of our experience. Impressive all round. Thank you for a lovely pre theatre experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU16UFBREAE,Very nice place to eat. Highly recommended Omer chef too good for this.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MUl5ZjRRRRAB,Very very good very very yummy Chef Omer very kind very high recommend come come plz
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU9UZXRnRRAB,"This place is ok, not great. Too much food colour in starters and in some curries. Biryani is good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NVBtX3h3RRAB,Great taste great service must try amazing presentation
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NVBtTi1BRRAB,nice way of meeting

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NVBuYTBnRRAB,"Very tasty food, friendly staff"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LVBIVmRREAE,"When I first arrived, the sign said it was closed when it was actually open (online said it was open so I went in). Service was horrendous and it took 20 minutes for the food to arrive. However, the food was decent. Would not recommend dining in due to the poor service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mko3OHB3RRAB,Excellent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d1A2TEJ3EAE,Their new restaurant is amazing. Briyani is the best thing on the menu. Other options are good but like it‚Äôs name their Briyani is top notch.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjZhTlFREAE,Just bought takeaway They messed up my order Totally incompetent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjlMZ0FnEAE,"Hyderabadi Biryani used to be super awesome. Not sure what has happened, they have moved to new shop which looks really good but the food taste has degraded heavily. Specially the biryani was pathetic today."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSai1XNW5BRRAB,"Chicken Biryani and the Masala Chicken were amazing! Really good.  Unfortunately the goat biryani had an overpowering smell of goat which I have not found in other indian restaurants, unsure if the meat was old? Also the Dal makhani was a disappointment, too sweet.  I would only come back for the chicken Biryani."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTVxWDVBRRAB,Popped in randomly for a quick snack and got some delicious curries!! We loved our daal makhani and pelak paneer very much (as well as the garlic cheese naan) yum! Open late too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTZQcWJBEAE,7/10 for food but there‚Äôs no waitstaff to clean other tables.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTlhZGVnEAE,Best biryani in Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb19TWWhRRRAB,"You should consider renaming to ""Bland house"" from Biryani house. The ""biryani"" they sell was rice boiled with meat, no hint of seasoning or flavour whatsoever. I've had hospital food that's 10 times better than what they're serving. Never ordering ever again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdGJxUExnEAE,Amazing Goat Biryani.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGRPYkJBEAE,"Very bad customer service, there was smell in the chicken, biryani is tasteless I don‚Äôt know why did they name this biryani house. They cook only jeera rice add some chicken no flavours at all which they call it biryani. Biryani is not cooked like this also you have to wait for your order around 25 minutes prioritise only takeaways and Uber eats. I asked the lady to clean the table but they didn‚Äôt bother at all I had to asked them again after 15 minutes the lady showed up for cleaning the table. Very bad experience don‚Äôt waste your time and money there. Go somewhere else."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJMFppTHFRRRAB,"Just next to the my office,fresh salads and reasonable prices."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvLWNua2xBRRAB,Good food. Clean establishment and the employees are very friendly!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRaF9UVUFREAE,Its on william street in city with adequate seatinv capacity.  Does not have wheelchair access. And no parents room either. But food is good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdmJfQ0lREAE,Very friendly staff.  Clean a d comfortable.  I go there for breakfast good value and quick service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNWZPRmNnEAE,"Pretty good if you need a quick and decent eat, but the coffee is very hit and miss. Busy, but lots of seating options, and the staff tend to be very good, if not quote enthusiastic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdUtqYzZBRRAB,Used to go every morning. Stopped going as they can never get order right. Losing old customers. Since new owners took over ratings gone down un my estimates.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3a0l5N2RnEAE,Good food. Good value. Huge glass of red that I couldn't finish. I had Vegetarian pasta. Yum.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncTVxQlVBEAE,Awesome Greek restaurant in Prospect! Great food and service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeE02LVJ3EAE,"Visited every morning for five weeks to find that I'd been over charged $2.20 every morning.  Barista, an utterly miserable Asian gentleman, lacking in any social skills whatsoever, could not have cared less. The manager then tried to pretend that the $7.20 for coffee and toast has ""just been introduced"" - why did you charge me that three weeks ago ? Barista refuses to speak and on one occasion at 7am kept me waiting for a full five minutes whilst he updated the blackboard - and then failed to even apologise. Worst service I've experienced in many a year. Many better places around. Avoid. I certainly won't return"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBb0szcVRnEAE,"Horrible customer service. The lady behind the counter wrongly took my order and it took lot of time just to make the latte. I ordered a small latte, she charged me for the large latte and served a small cappuccino. I have been there on the way to office and wasted my 15 min. Not at all recommending this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnaVlqbFVREAE,Staff were very very friendly and the eggs Benedict was amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbjdHNXdRRRAB,Had Hard toasted Sandwich lol. Good customer service.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodjZ2aWhBRRAB,"I enjoyed the crispy, piping hot fried chicken, and we thanked them for helping us separate the sauce. The soup was pretty good as well, and my friends enjoyed the cold noodle as we had it on a really hot day. Kimchi pancake was alright, and overall we had a great time here. Cosy atmosphere and we'll return soon! Thank you üòé"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocmEtZzVRRRAB,I ordered whole chicken with half n half sauce.  The two flavor sauces all mixed so i cant find which one is which. even the fried chicken has black parts which looks like cooked in dirty oil! The taste was disappointing as well. It was my first time order and I wont order again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocnNpb1ZnEAE,The watermelon desert is the best 11/10
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbjhhakVnEAE,One of the many Korean restaurants in this area dubbed the Korea-town that open till late. The place is not that big and usually gets busy so booking ahead of time is recommended especially in larger groups. The food is great and the flavour seems perfect for drinking sessions. We would recommend the egg rolls and the seafood hotpot. Food - 8 Service - 8 Vibe - 9 Price - $$
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaTdYVktBEAE,worker angry. why?
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbGRTdTNBRRAB,Good place to drink soju and beer.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteHFqNVNBEAE,"The waiter was super rude, was there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday ruined the whole vibe and mood with his racist comments and attitude, dude trust me you don‚Äôt want to be in this place unless you speak their language."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbnZXYWNREAE,"This place is perfect for late night munchies. Stays open past midnight and great selection of hearty food. We got the spicy beef ribs stew and it was delicious. Very tender ribs and chewy potato starch noodles. We also got a kimchi pancake which was a little on the oily side, but was very big and flavourful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaUl5czZRRRAB,Good vibes for hangout with friends
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cVBhejZ3RRAB,Amazing food and excellent service I came here more than 3 times and never disappointed about the quality of food. Good prices with a generous portion. Staffs was pretty nice and prompt. Give them a try if you want to find an authentic Korean noodle restaurant üëç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cVB6dS1RRRAB,"Been wanting to try jjajangmyeon for the longest time and finally got to try it at Paik‚Äôs. The sauce was flavourful and tasty, if there was one thing I‚Äôd change to enhance the dish, it‚Äôd be to add more pork!! Otherwise, the noodles were soft and delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aVAtS3dRRRAB,"Noodles were far too spicy, virtually no meat, boring flavour. I ate a couple mouthfuls then gave up. Would not recommend."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWJMcEhnEAE,Reasonable price for Jjangmyeon and Jjampong with TangSuYuk on the side.. taste is not bad too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmJ6N3RBRRAB,"Another pleasant dinning experience from the Paiks enterprise!  As soon as you step into the two level restaurant you know you will be in for a treat, don‚Äôt expect your traditional KBBQ but a variety of mouth watering dishes starting from the sides through the signature soup and noodle dishes!  A simple menu that is easy to read and takes away the confusion! Simplified but yet enticing dishes that will surely impress even the fastidious dinners!  Dishes of the night were Jjamppong - spicy noodle soup. Beef bokkeumbap a hearty fried rice with beef tender brisket with vegetables and egg. Gochu yuringi - spicy fried chicken with chilli peppers and soy sauce, which tasted somewhat similar to lemon chicken.  Expect a line during the busy end of the week but the wait is short and flowing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWJfbTNRRRAB,"Best Korean food, very authentic"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGN6cFJnEAE,"Korean jajangmyun, I ordered a noodle for 2 people (jengbanjajang) but i receieved only vegietables with very little seafood portion. Taste ok. Small portion of noodles too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODlDRk93EAE,"It‚Äôs a noodle store located on the western side of the CBD, which is a quick tram ride from Melbourne Central. The jjajangmyeon here is some of the jjajangmyeon of all time. I could not taste much going on, so I have no clue why this place is so hyped up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbHVlS3RBRRAB,"great costumer service, nice food and drink, been here twice and sure will be here again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3ZDQXNRRRAB,"Loved the food. Tried the Jjampong, jjajjyang bap, tangsuyuk and prawns. All comfort food type. No big crowd at 1pm, lots of takeaways but our food came fast. Place is clean, cutlery etc at side of table in drawers under the table."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkk3QTNBRRAB,"As expected, the tasteless Hong Kong spot. Korea or Melbourne... . It's just the taste of eating because I miss you"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXRHcTR3RRAB,Good food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVBEVjlBRRAB,"Ja jang myun in Syd is so over priced, its around $19 a bowl. I am so impressed with 11.90 ja jang myun here. Taste the same. It will be your budget efficient choice of all time. Try out!!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc0p1VFpREAE,We had the half half combo special - noodles with sweet and sour pork. We also had the fried rice with Wagyu beef and it was tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE96Y0VREAE,Great food and exceptional service!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEtUN19nRRAB,"Very solid 4.5. The black bean sauce is scary to look at but delightful to eat. The rice, egg and sauce together as a combination was phenomenal.  Fried rice and deep friend chicken were good but not great, nothing special but still delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjlheDNBRRAB,Noodles were rlly nice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajVLQTB3RRAB,Delicious and worth coming back for
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDk2U3JnRRAB,"Went here for lunch with friends, and the food and drinks were super affordable. My meal was less than $10, which was great as food can be pricey sometimes in Melbourne. On top of being cheap, the food tasted really nice and did well to fill me up, meaning I didn't feel like any follow-up snacks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDVhN0VREAE,"Real taste of korean, somehow better than many restaurant in Korea"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDZMTlBBEAE,Good food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dklqUW9BRRAB,Had dinner here Friday night. Food was delicious and the staff were fantastic!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaGNQY0NBEAE,"Amazing food, staff and dining experience. Highly recommend for this spot for a start to a big night for a couple (dates included) or a big group of friends or family."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmNTNlpREAE,"Our combined friend group from all over Melbourne rarely gets together, but when we do we usually start the night at Mapo. Which once had amazing food, great service and atmosphere you won't want to leave. Now the food is terrible, lacks flavour and our usual luxury set feels as if it's gotten smaller, the meat wasn't fresh the coal wasn't lit properly and getting the attention of wait staff was near impossible considering the restaurant was basically empty. Now the bill was $665 including a 15% surplus for being good Friday, which is understandable but the food and service was definitely not worth it. Will be looking for a new Korean BBQ location."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSamFDMHN3RRAB,"The customer service was so poor, the person ignored us when we tried to order. When she put down side dishes she threw it on the table, plus the grill wasn‚Äôt hot enough and meat took ages to cook. All of the staffs was on their phone when we looked over to the counter. When my friend forgot her card the staff responded rudely. Would not recommend, please check in with your staffs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbFl2bGNBEAE,"The service attitude here is very poor, which has directly ruined my good mood. When I walked in, I just sat in my seat, and no one provided any service for me until I went to the front desk to inquire. They were very rude and told me to continue waiting. In short, this is the worst service attitude I have ever experienced.  Add comment: Thank you for your response. I came here at around 11:35 pm last night, but I didn't end up ordering anything and left because of the attitude of the waiter makes me feel uncomfortable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNV8tdkt3EAE,Great for a late night Korean feed (& beer) üçª ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNnRQc1hnEAE,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Full stop.  Giant jugs of Korean beer, exquisitely-marinated meat (I cannot recommend the Spicy Pork Belly enough), great kimchi pancake, and spectacular customer service. If I lived in Melbourne, it'd be hard not to want to come to Mapo at least once a week."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHFXNFNBEAE,The food was fair to good nothing special. Service was even though the place filled up quickly. They only served 3 sides with our BBQ combo plus a salad. Like I said nothing special and soso food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMS1TNm1RRRAB,"This is 1 of my favourite places to have Korean BBQ for Awesome Appetites.  I love this place because I usually do finish work late. And when I do finish work at 12am to 2am most places aren‚Äôt open.  So, it‚Äôs AWESOME that Mapo Grill & Bar is open until 1am to 3am.  For me, I think when meat is cooked using a charcoal grill it tastes better‚Äîlike they do here at Mapo Grill & Bar.  Plus, I‚Äôve been here many, many times and they have never disappointed with their AWESOME customer service and mouth-watering food.  So, I‚Äôll give this place a 5-out-of-5 for if you‚Äôre looking to have Korean BBQ for Awesome Appetites."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM2NEOXZ3RRAB,Amazing food! Well priced
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNFBpdWlnRRAB,"The food was really good , they source the beef and chicken from halal certified meat stores. Also the staff was friendly. Overall we had a great experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCanY2RWJBEAE,"Didn‚Äôt accept a walk in customers , even though they have free tables as far as the eye can see, and it‚Äôs 1130pm. And yes, the kitchen was still open.  Edit Post Response: Thank you for the response, much appreciated. Your staff must have mistaken us with someone else, since we never had a conversation or being advised about waiting time for charcoal. We left because were advised that you only accept reservations. Thank you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjdiMEp3EAE,The food was lovely with great quality meat! Perfect for dining.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCall6TU93EAE,#NAME?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLWFIelZnEAE,"Very good wagyu beef, fully recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbF9QN3JRRRAB,"The perfect place to have a dinner, the staff are very friendly, perfect for friends. In particular, their wagyu beef selection can be said to be one of the best in Melbourne, and their stir-fried dishes are also very delicious. It's a great evening for drinking soju with friends"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeE5XRUFREAE,"The staff were so lovely and the food was incredible, the meat was so soft and flavourful, the menu has such a great range of options!! And the corn cheese was so delicious :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdWEtVW5BRRAB,Korean cold noodle only comes with 1 SAMLL piece of beef and they charged me $16. This is robbery.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdWZYTDN3RRAB,"Good quality meats, spacious and food comes out quickly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMmRqUHhBRRAB,Well price good taste. Book in advance to get the best table.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc0tHTW5nRRAB,"Worst korean bbq I‚Äôve been to. The grill wasn‚Äôt hot enough. The rice tasted terrible like some cheap rice. The pancake wasn‚Äôt cooked properly, the dough was still wet. Only one staff serving all the tables and the service was very slow. There are many other better restaurants than this one."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNnZxMGxnRRAB,"I recently had a great Korean bbq experience at Mapo Grill. Visiting for dinner we decided to order items individually rather than one of the set combinations. We got the beef bulgogi, pork belly, spicy chicken thigh fillet, vegetable combination and seasonal mushrooms. We accompanied this with steamed rice and a vegetable pancake along with rice punch, grape juice and lychee soju to drink.  The great thing about KBBQ at Mapo is that the staff do all the cooking at the table for you. This is particularly handy if you‚Äôre not much of a cook or if you‚Äôre relatively new to Korean bbq.  Everything we ordered was delicious and was very filling. The highlights for me were the beef bulgogi, chicken, mushrooms and the vegetable pancake. The beef was juicy and tender and the bulgogi marinade was lovely whilst the spicy chicken thigh was full of flavour. The mushrooms worked beautifully on the bbq and the vegetable pancake was nice and crispy.  I rate Mapo Grill ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è out of 5. The food was delicious and I loved that the team assist with all the cooking. Thanks very much for having me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMU42dkVnEAE,Love the pork belly set. The pork belly original is so good. No bad smell Form Pork at all. The soy sauce marinated one is also delicious. Love the sweetness form the pork and the spicy marinated is so tasty. It‚Äôs so full at the end.  The soup was great and corn cheese make the bbq taste even better.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleDhQZEdBEAE,Mapo is still consistently goodüòã The traditional Korean food and creative idea to enter the Melbourne market.  Find out >> Melbourne‚Äôs Ktown @mapogrillbbq  üé• Follow for more videos!

The service was amazing and the servers was incredibly friendly and accommodating! Will definitely come again! üòçüòç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjZIN0V3EAE,Ordered via app. Smallest portion I have ever had at a kebab shop. Not sure if it was a one time thing but the quantity of meat was abysmal and looks nothing like what‚Äôs shown on the website. 90% of it was salad which was charged as extra.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScVpYbGFnEAE,"Came across this take out kebab shop while walking through the city. It was very busy and looked fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was so tasty and good value large portions for the price. Crispy chips, delicious meat and yummy salads. Had a great take out dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0pLM0t3EAE,great food and service. The portions are HUGE and taste great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNThMNzVBRRAB,Stopped in with the family for some city food. Food was served fast and freshly made and we walked out full and satisfied.  Only having a small space to sit and eat was our only issue otherwise delicious üëå
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDl5RFhnEAE,Best kebab anyone can find in the city. Very friendly behaviour and quick food serve. Highly recommended üî•

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMEtEU1RnEAE,Super affordable and delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDYzeXpRRRAB,Good kebab. Meat was spongy and tasted good

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocUxYa1VBEAE,"My go to for HSP, unbeatable in taste and price. Also, $10 kebabs? You won't find that anywhere else. Just wish they were open late on Saturdays!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoZ0syTUdREAE,HSP is exactly what i needed. jam donuts fried to perfection and the turkish delight is so good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcTlPSHJnRRAB,This is one the best kebab shop i have ever tasted. The staff is very friendly and make the best kebab ever. If you want to spend good money on good things then this is the best place for you. Because every penny counts ü´°ü§òüèªüíØ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCczZQUjhnRRAB,Best kabab in Melbourne
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcy1YcnBRRRAB,The smallest kebab I've ever had in Melbourne. You can see how thin it is comparing with a can of coke. Disappointed!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMWNmQ0xBEAE,Good service and delicious kebabs
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaGRubHN3RRAB,Good food

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWZIQU5nEAE,"Worst customer service, i find the young guy who serves rude. And they never says thank u to their customer üëéüèº"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbDZHcVJREAE,"Went for the roast duck.. Pretty good, not salty Love the greens that comes with it!! üòã"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHNuYzV3RRAB,Great food and service!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtekpTSmVBEAE,"We had been waiting for our orders for more than 20 minutes while they put the priority to cook and served the dishes for other guests who came after us. We already reminded twice but they made an excuses like our Peking pork took long time to be finished which didn‚Äôt make sense at all, as the other guest had ordered the same.  One more thing, the food quality is not so good. The rice wasn‚Äôt well-cooked which resulted in the hard and cold tastes. The pork taste smell is not fresh too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNzRDUUVnEAE,"I used to love this place, but they have recently changed hands and the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I ordered Satay Chicken with rice, there was hardly any chicken, a ton of onion, 1 stalk of brocoli with no flower on it, 3 pieces of carrot and a heap of some green vegetable that is disgusting (don't even know what it is.) This place used to be packed at lunchtime and now it is mostly empty. I wonder why."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtanF2WWlnRRAB,"Microwave food, not fresh."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb2ZmSzZRRRAB,Full price half value
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX1ByM1F3EAE,Disgusting. Will never eat here again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbG96VGdnRRAB,"Amazingly pleasant Chinese BBQ food here in the CBD office area (roast duck, roast pork,‚Ä¶). The aunties could not speak English well, so you might want to have something in mind first before heading. But they are very friendly!  Bad thing is that this place closes down quite often, and does not have a proper tax invoice (the auntie will write the order number and ABN to a paper for you, but not sure if that can help when you need to claim anything like the Melbourne Money scheme."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcUpENWVREAE,Lovely staff and a great meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOHFHR2ZREAE,huge delicious portions for a great price :) nice people working there as well :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeVBiWU5nEAE,What can I say? I've been here so many times I've lost count. Food and service are quite good. My favourites are the roast dishes but sadly those have been unavailable for a while now. Hope they bring them back soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXenJDcmVnEAE,"I ordered fish-flavored eggplant stew, ginger and scallion fish fillets, and seasonal vegetable tofu. All tasted great! Great service, great value for money, highly recommended!  Very good service and quality food with reasonable price. Can't complain anything at all!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdlBPa0F3EAE,"Very friendly staff, generous servings and great sweet and sour pork with lots of sauce. Will definitely be going back :-)"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtajZPUWxRRRAB,Wonderful food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtajhYYmhRRRAB,"Very friendly staff, outstanding service. The food is well cooked. Was a little disappointed they didn't have the Hainan Chicken Rice but the salt and pepper chicken was very good. Would definitely go again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdlB2QlVREAE,"We came here about 1pm on a Monday, the place had a few occupied tables but wasn't packed for lunch time. Service wasn't friendly but I wouldn't say rude either, let's say it was efficient which is good enough for me.  I ordered the hot sour soup which wasn't that great, it was slightly spicy which just nice for me, had a few tiny prawns, tofu, sliced char siu in it so it filled me up but didn't satisfy me. My son had the curry laksa which was a mistake, don't expect much of a Malaysian dish in a Chinese restaurant. The curry tasted like it was made from powdered curry, don't think any coconut milk was in it. My husband loved his BBQ pork on rice, my daughter actually finished up her honey chicken on rice so must mean it was good.  The toilet was a bit of a maze getting to, you exit a door that says fire alarm do not open, down a dark stairs, out another door then there's the toilet door. The place stinks of cockroaches and I was expecting to see one running around, thankfully didn't."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd0szOFVBEAE,"Food is average, good friendly service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMzlxQVF3EAE,Beautiful affordable Asian cuisine. Definitely recommend
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeHNxWXVnRRAB,"I arrived at a strange time of 3pm so the duck was a bit cold, but it was still so juicy and FULL of flavour. There was a subtle sweet hint that I have not tasted for a long time, it was delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbC1tYkpBEAE,"Amazing venue to host your next function.  Very easy to deal with and the food were generous size portions.  Even if it is raining (as it was for us) the entire outdoor area is covered, so no need to worry about that.  There is parking next door too and it is located right next to Flagstaff train station."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEozbWhnRRAB,"While the food style didn't seem to mesh well with the atmosphere, the fact that it was very good helped a lot and was a lovely night."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM19DQ1l3EAE,"Really nice. At with 8 craft beers on tap, very good and popular."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMFlpT0J3EAE,Well the Tuesday $22 parma special was well worth the stop. Beer standard prices and service was great üëå this place was pumping at 530pm so get in early üëç. You can order drinks and food from your table and is delivered üçª I will definitely be back.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoejhfWXVRRRAB,Had a lovely fish and chips meal here. Located just around the corner from my hotel Pegasus
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczdMaTBRRRAB,"I am extremely disappointed with my experience at the mint tonight. On every other occasion I have had a great time but tonight my friends and I arrived, . A young bartender came out to serve us drinks and he accidentally spilled an entire glass of beer and 2 white wines  all over me . All of our drinks were spilt in the process.  I understand this was a mistake but the staff after did not even offer us another drink? My understanding is that the normal process would be to at least offer us our drinks that were spilled all over me for free lol? is the common practice to spill drinks all over a customer then act like it‚Äôs their fault?  So I go inside smelling revolting and humiliated and kindly request they rectify the situation and offer us drinks. She asks me if I want the manager; I say no it‚Äôs ok I understand it‚Äôs a mistake and I don‚Äôt want to get the boy in trouble but I just want our table to be handled. They eventually agree to offer us drinks (again humiliating when I‚Äôm the one who is soaked and smelling horrible) but the lady comes out outside and just slams the drinks on the table and walks away. I was left very disappointed, In fact disgusting  at their entire temperament   following this even though we continued to stay there and ordered food and more drinks. Not happy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGNlamNREAE,"If the staff and the service is not good, I don't care about the atmosphere or the good. Thankfully, The Mint has it all. Great simple food, fantastic atmosphere,  amazing service and outstanding staff always smiling Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeVlQQ1VREAE,"Fantastic service, great real friendly staff with personality, it‚Äôs unlikely you will be met with a generic flat traditional pub barman/woman at this joint. And the best parmas this side of the Mississippi (in my opinion anyway)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGZQV21BRRAB,Was a little loud despite the carpet. Service was trying to please but didn't understand specific requests. Food was good. Many drinks were not available as 'delivery was coming tomorrow.'
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMzkyZUVBEAE,A favourite location for a long time. The Gnocchi is the stand out dish!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEplQVl3EAE,Great tucker and plenty of it. Yummy side dishes wirh endless refills.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0xmWDFnRRAB,Best Korean BBQ !!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmVYSVVBEAE,One of the best Korean BBQ!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmNqUjhRRRAB,"Okay korean bbq place, price is a little expensive but their choice of drinks and beef is not bad but the serving size is relatively small  Definitely other better kbbq places in city but if you're in a pickle then try it out"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbWIyNG5RRRAB,One of the best in town
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaW9uZmF3EAE,"You can‚Äôt go wrong with Paiks.  Great staff, fast service and a great place to bring friends. Definitely one of the best in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk1tU3BnRRAB,"Good quality BBQ that you can eat at the cheapest price in Melbourne! It's so delicious... Because of the taste, I come regularly! also awesome"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzgtWkJBEAE,Very rude. Confirm appointment time with one of staff is 9 o clock. Staff: ‚ÄúI already said 9!‚Äù Well bye bye then. üëãüëã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMy1lZG9BRRAB,"I made a booking at 9:30 pm, came early at 8:30pm, politely asked whether they have table available. The staff asked us to come back at 9pm, I just want to double check if I got it right, I asked him ‚Äò at 9pm right‚Äô? He replied ‚Äò yes I already said 9‚Äô . Rude staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDVYTklBEAE,Amazing food and banchan
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ19PYTRnRRAB,"Really great KBBQ experience. Many side dishes that come with the set, excellent quality meat and affordable price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnFIRHJnRRAB,Good kbbq to visit in the city! We got the $88.8 beef combo which included three meats and a soybean stew (you can choose between that or kimchi stew). The soybean stew was still a little spicy by the way. But it was really good! The meats were also good quality and tasted fresh. Would recommend to have with family and friends :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbG95dEtREAE,"Normally BBQ should be all about meat but I definitely felt that the star here was the side dishes. Seaweed soup, spicy fishcakes, crabsticks, macaroni salad, etc. So much variety and all of them tasted so good, I would say this place is the best kbbq in town based just on that.  As for the meat, the pork belly was thick and good quality, and the spicy yeoltan bulgogi also tasted fresh albeit a little too salty for my taste.  Would recommend getting the DIY rice balls as well instead of just plain rice for that little bit of extra flavor.  Also, if you can, try asking for seats that aren't at the very back of the restaurant, since that's where large groups are placed and it can get really noisy and extremely bothersome when you're just trying to eat in peace."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSekxmblp3EAE,My go-to korean bbq place. Nice service and good food. The corona beer slushies is to die for. I wish they would have korean fried chicken in the menu though since I think that this might be the first korean restaurant that don‚Äôt do fried chicken.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEttbWpRRRAB,My last dinner in Aussie 2023 was in Paik's BBQ.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN19YeGRBEAE,A must visit every single drive to town.. Worth every penny.. Service was quick and people are lovely. Great ambient and K-feel the moment you walked in.. Good portion too..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOWJQcHlnRRAB,"weekday evening visit I knew for the first time since I was born that Saemaeul Restaurant was in Melbourne. It is located in a place where there are many Korean restaurants around. Baek Jong-won Franchise Hong Kong Banjeom is also around, so it's a surprise I ate a beef combo and an old bento box, but the price was higher than I thought, so I felt that the price was higher than in Korea. The taste seems to have made a lot of effort to preserve the local feel of Korea. Most of the customers seemed to be Asian, but there seemed to be a lot of Chinese. It is said that there is a wait on weekends or popular times, and that the store hours are limited to 1 hour and 30 minutes. The store is very large, so it's good to eat in groups. Convenience of QR ordering"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWFXUFV3EAE,"Nice food, recommend for omelette pork on steam rice"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ2ZldkxBEAE,"We were craving for Korean BBQ and stumbled across this restaurant.  The set up of the restaurant is nice & neat.  Service is really fast too.  We ordered Yeoltan Spicy pork Bulgogi & Yeoltan Soy Pork Bulgogi from the BBQ menu, they are both very tasty üòçtheir Stir Fry Rice Cake is also really good, and we love the Rolled Egg.  We also ordered Budae Jjigae which is also quite good.  Love their side dishes!  The side dishes are so yum!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3JDQy13RRAB,Really enjoyed BBQ here! Good service and great quality meats. Highly recommend üëçüèº ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ3NlSWRBEAE,Dined in tonight our second visit to Paik's & wasnt disappointed..so far the Best korean bbq me & my wife have had! We love the charcoal setup as the meat tastes spectacular! The kimchi soup still one of the best! Great feasting great experience..highly recommend! Happy eating to all...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX0s2cGJ3EAE,The marinated wagyu oyster blade is so good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjZ6ZFFBEAE,"I eat a fair bit and love Korean bbq. When I say the signature set is very big. take my word for it, it is massive! I think it‚Äôs a great option because it comes with so many dishes. You have to check out my photos to see it. The table couldn‚Äôt even hold the set. I suggest having at least 6 people for the signature set. Come with friends/family and enjoy the delicious Smokey meats, the hearty savoury soups and the refreshing sashimi!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzdQVDZ3RRAB,"Not sure what all the fuss is about. This is a KBBQ for everyone else, any Korean would laugh at this place. The prices and portions are not even close to being satisfactory! The place has ok staff, but they are reluctant to speak Korean to native speakers.  Side dishes are tasteless.  Sashimi is 3 pieces of Tuna, seriously?! What is that? Honestly, the 2 best KBBQ are less than 300m away; I hate wasting money and this place is a waste of good money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzVqdHh3RRAB,"Best kbbq service. We had the $85 set for two, comes with meat(a lot), lettuce, soup, rice, and a delicious steamed eggs dish. They really care if you are enjoying your meal. Side dish refills are free."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMl9mWlFBEAE,"All the meat is delicious, there are a lot of side dishes, and there are many types of alcohol, and the staff are very friendly. But the stew is not very tasty.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTZqZDhnRRAB,"Man, let me tell you, the service at this joint was off the chain. The side dishes were straight up awesome, and don't even get me started on the main dish - that Sundae soup was on point.  But what really blew my mind was the way Yenny took care of us. She was so attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  I can't recommend this place enough. If you're looking for some killer food and top-notch service, you gotta check this spot out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNl8tVHlnRRAB,"Me and my friend came here and we ordered Sundae, Intestine & Mandoo Hot Pot. First, they brought us some delicious side dishes. The hot pot was absolutely amazing, and the floor staff was exceptional. They treated us with such great care and were always ready to help with anything we needed.  I'm definitely planning to come back and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal and outstanding service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGRib1JnEAE,"Great service, generous portions and most importantly delicious food. Will be back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWQzb1lnEAE,"Tried this new kbbq place in the city with friends.. they have quite various selection of foods to order - but hopefully the drinks section would be more available as several drinks that I was about to order that time all out of stock, so back to the usual soju ü•≤ We ordered the wagyu set with some a la carte dishes. Meats are fresh, tteokbokki has more various ingredients than most other places (I think haha) - love the ingredients but not as much for the taste, a bit too sweet for me. I had the pancake when it was long time served (finishing my meat, soup etc first) but it still tastes good - the cheese addition makes it more yum üòã Oh and love the gold tablewares!! There was quite a wait for our food to arrive, especially considering not even the meats has arrived yet (which just plated & no need to be cooked first), but service is prompt and friendly üòä"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScVpmZ3JBRRAB,Amazing Korean BBQ. Perfect food and service. Strongly recommend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWJpWXBnRRAB,"The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the wagyu beef, which was of excellent quality. The meat was fresh and paired perfectly with the delicious sides and sauces provided."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWZ1RGZ3EAE,"Good restaurant, good service, good food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWRtcnZ3RRAB,"Super delicious, very fresh and portion üâëÔ∏è"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWNqZVdnEAE,"I highly recommend this Korean barbecue restaurant. They excel in the quality of their food, the excellent service, and the comfortable atmosphere. If you're looking to try authentic Korean barbecue, this is definitely a place worth visiting!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3AySUt3EAE,"Super attentive staff and great food. Love this new kbbq spot, generous portions too. Such a good spot for drinks and eat"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXBTNjVnRRAB,"this is one of those on my best-list! everything was nice just a tad cringy of the interior design the red floor and quite smoky in the indoor. overall theyre friendly, food was high quality, i like their kimchi and yukae as well! have been twice and will def go again! one more thing, they re a little understaffed.. so‚Ä¶.but it doesnt affect my satisfaction to it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXVtV3lBRRAB,"A new hidden gem in ktown, the meat quality is really good. Had a great experience with good service and foods."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdk1Xd3d3RRAB,"the place is just okay but I‚Äôm a little disappointed. side dishes are good and lots of variety of dishes. the downside is, we tried to order the spare rib that was pictured, but received LA style rib instead. when my husband asked about it, one of the staff said this was the spare rib. I work in a kbbq restaurant and have served and cooked these meats before so I can clearly differentiate between the two. It‚Äôs a little upsetting that we had to pay for and eat it when it wasn‚Äôt the right oneüò≠ I know every place is different so that‚Äôs why we decided not to argue, but my husband did clearly order in Korean to the Korean waitress the meat we wanted to order‚Ä¶.. obviously taste of the bbq wasn‚Äôt that good as it‚Äôs not using the real charcoal(which I‚Äôm a little disappointed by considering the price.)the service here is just acceptable, but maybe next time don‚Äôt gaslight us to thinking we ordered something when we didn‚Äôt ? üòÇ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSek5DNE9nEAE,"Outstanding service, delicious food, great value. We came from Sydney and had a delightful time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbEtxMGpRRRAB,Absolutely amazing food and good price.Thanks YUNA for tonight.Perfect service.Really enjoyed tonight.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbE1yRTRnRRAB,I came to visit for a very first time. The food was great and very impressive with the service here with YUNA.  I‚Äôll came back again next time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbE1DQWxBRRAB,"Pretty good! The infrared (I think?) grill is fantastic; steady heat that caramelises your meat without cooling down in spots as gas or charcoal can do when loaded up with protein. I expected to miss the charcoal flavour from a charcoal BBQ, but honestly this was just as good in a different way. Very good range of menu items, huge selection of all kinds of meat and seafoods. Attentive and happy staff (staff actually smiling!). Only complaint was the kimchi pancake being a little gooey and not crispy, but was still enjoyable.  Note: get in there NOW while they still have the 20% discount opening promo running üòâ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUtMeEdREAE,"Great vibe, delicious food and friendly service. Will definitely come back next time. Now this is my favourite Korean BBQ in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVBpOWpnRRAB,This is a new Korean BBQ restaurant. The environment is very nice and the meat is delicious. Yuna is very warm and considerate. I'll come back next time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScExfRWJREAE,"Extremely delicious food with super friendly staff, especially Yuna!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScE9xalRBEAE,"We ordered wagyu set for two, meat quality and portion was pretty good ! All the staff are so friendly and polite I definitely want to visit again üëç"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdV9pQnB3RRAB,"Used to come here a few months ago and haven't been for a while because the staff were unkind and the food was not good. I don't know if the boss has changed or the menu, but the overall taste is delicious. I was very moved by the customer service of the staff I saw for the first time. Very kind! The names of the dishes on the menu are in Korean, so please explain, but you are very kind and told us the dishes in detail, and we also received recommendations! The cocktails are delicious, but the price of alcohol has risen compared to before."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdThDcFpBEAE,"Since the weather is getting colder, I thought of soup, so I ate pork soup and kimchi pancake. There wasn't much meat in the pork soup, but even that had too much fat, and the kimchi pancake was a bit too salty... Rather, the staff must have been bothered by asking and asking for this and that, but they were very kind, so I didn't bother complaining, but compared to other Korean restaurants, I don't think I'll come back because there's no merit in that it's particularly delicious, cheap, or large in quantity. Ah, the kimchi jjigae, sundubu jjigae, and bibimbap looked delicious.."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTcxTBAB,"Went here after karaoke and ordered the Korean chicken and bossam, which were incredible especially the bossam which was soft and tasty"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHMzMTF3RRAB,"The staffs were really kind, service was really great"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3VxbzlBRRAB,"I couldn't find a reason to visit there again.  Side dish isn't good, rice isn't good, and meat in the soup isn't great either. I don't think the meat is in good quality.  Service is the worst, not kind and not trained. They don't know what they are supposed to do.  My friend and I both are very disappointed. We won't go there again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkxqcDVRRRAB,"Amazing food, but services need to be a little better üòä"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSci1MQUZnEAE,Fried chicken is nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbE5QNllnEAE,"Was here last night after deciding that I wanted to try a new Korean restaurant. Vas very disappointed with the portions of the beef bulgogi and the cheese bul dak. After reading reviews of other people, they were also upset with the portions as I was. Sorry to say but I think they need to pick up their game a little. But the staff were nice and friendly. I will stick to Janggun as they have always been good with portions and taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMjRhZmFREAE,"Dropped by recently here, seeing some nice seating space passing by Healeys lane & Little Lonsdale st. Service was good and chef was accomodating and made myself a chicken Bulgogi (as they had only beef /pork bulgogi on menu) which I really appreciate.  Ambience was good, & dish was pretty decent, & comes along with a bowl of rice üçö but not that saucy & striking, as I expected. Nevertheless portion size was pretty decent and enough for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMmFuS253RRAB,"The food was okay, but they seemed to be a bit understaffed and it took quite long to get my food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNHFYamVREAE,"I went to see the business name Gukbap in a distant area and was satisfied :) However, kimchi and diced radish kimchi are important for rice soup in Korea, but the kimchi tasted the same as other Korean restaurants, and the amount was small and there was no diced radish kimchi. It was delicious enough though. Tteokbokki was good because it tasted similar to what we ate in front of the old school, but the quantity was too small compared to the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbTVfTlFnEAE,"I had dwaeji gukbap on 3/1 , and got food poisoning and gastro on the next day. It‚Äôs highly possible that the pork they are using are contaminated with bacteria or maybe the baby shrimp they had in the restaurant is contaminated. I‚Äôll will nvr come here again although the food is good. Please have ur staffs to double check the pork and also the baby shrimp."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcVpqQXl3RRAB,Really love the dwaeji gukbap + maeun galbitang
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcGZDNzVRRRAB,Good for a simple meal
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOUt1OEN3EAE,"It's been a really long time so it's a memorable restaurant hahahaha A long-lived restaurant keke It reminds me of the old days after being there for over 10 years, and I hear it again because it's delicious hahahahahahahahahahahaha It's good to go for a drink and go to the beach hahaha It's delicious"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleDZLR0JnEAE,Staff are rude and flippant towards possible customers. Not very welcoming at all. Didn't even get to try the food as I was not staying to be treated like a diseased person.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaTRTM0VREAE,Fantastic Korean food - one of my new favourites!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOWZxUEZBEAE,Tripe soup and rice cake are really well flavoured. Didn't wait too long before dishes were served. It was very noisy though and I could barely hear my friend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbWVqRThBRRAB,Good food and service.  Will go back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNXJLNm9RRRAB,"Always delicious, friendly service and quickly served. Must try is the LA beef ribs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDY3RzN3RRAB,I like spicy chicken pizza üî•üî• ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemVMREhBEAE,"Must try their Korean Pizza's!!  Menu has a large variety to choose from,  we ordered the monster pizza, snow cheese chicken, rose tteokbokki, cream bulgogi pasta, garlic bread, blue lemonade and grapefruit-ade. highly recommend their signature monster pizza and their Korean style pasta dishes !  opens quite late so its a great spot to bring friends ! conveniently also located near kono-karaoke and a Korean style Photo Booth spot !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdFpia25RRRAB,Amazing food! The definition of unique and tasty comfort food. Definitely worth trying with friends.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbFpXaUtREAE,"We ordered the set meal which comes with pizza, tteokbokki and fried chicken. On top of that, we ordered the cream bulgogi pasta (this was delicious!) and added garlic bread to it. We requested for the pizza crust to be filled with cheese and sweet potato - the signature pizza was very unique and tasty. It was such a good lunch - we had real a good time!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenVmeGNBEAE,Shocking. No one speaks English. Highly overpriced and average pizza. Avoid
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMUxMNHhBRRAB,"There are a few Korean pizzerias that are open until late at night. I have eaten two or three kinds of pizzas so far, and they are all very good. They have different flavors. If you want to experience a few more at a time, choose monster pizza. As a Korean shop, rice cakes are very good. The hot sauce is actually different from other Korean shops. It is spicier but fuller. The fried chicken is a bit ordinary, and the taste is no different from that of ordinary fried chicken shops. The few Korean pizzerias that have been open until late at night, currently tried two or three pizzas, they are very good, a variety of different flavors, if you want to experience a few more at once, choose monster pizza. rice cake is very good, the Korean hot chilli sauce is actually different from other Korean restaurants, more spicy but also more plump. Fried chicken is a bit ordinary, and the taste is no different from that of a regular fried chicken restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOGJDVmJnEAE,"Tried their famous  loaded Premium Monstet Pizza which has unique ingredients and flavours. They also have Korean fried chicken, tteokbokki and Korean fusion pasta dishes.  The shark cocktail was also the highlight of the night. Great fusion pizza and korean dishes"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3NIYVVnEAE,"Such a cool unique dining experience in a city that has so much delicious Korean food. I love Korean flavours and I'm surprised it's taken so long for the concept of a KOREAN pizza place to come up! I recommend the monster pizza which gives you a variety of different toppings, but the bulgolgi was my favourite! Also recommend getting the soy garlic fried chicken and tteokbokki which had great flavours. The KSP (Korean Snack Pack) is also the best treat for those classic late nights!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcjVlMTR3RRAB,One of my favourite restaurants in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMXFYT0t3EAE,Delicious and authentic food with friendly and helpful staff.  We had the soy marinated crab which was devine. Sashimi platter was fresh and delicious. Entree dishes and army stew were very enjoyable too.  Would have been better if they can take bookings.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbWJiYW1nRRAB,Massive portions. Comfort food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyLTZyY1p3EAE,"Ordered the veggie and tofu curry rice here and I can absolutely see myself coming back for it! Generous portion, very yummy and customised to my liking (requested a bit of heat in the curry)!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb2JTM2h3RRAB,Was really good overall with food and service! Good to come with big groups as the portions are really big. Ambience was a bit chaotic but not unexpected.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdjdYSEJnEAE,One of Melbourne's Hidden Gems!  Whisked away in down Healey's Lane is probably one of the most incredible dinner spots I've ever encountered.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMjVlMXZnRRAB,"This is such a fabulous restaurant. The food is incredibly good. The sushi was extremely fresh. The scallop roll sushi was really delicate and so good.

It is joined to its sister restaurant Seven Star we tried the potato noodles, fried chicken & tuna rolls and they all were amazing. We will def become regulars here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazctdjJRRRAB,Assorted Sashimi is average. Love their pork belly and toppoki!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOWN5akp3EAE,"Decided to walk in and try their food, great range of dishes on offer. I chose the grilled chicken cold soba salad to eat in which was fantastic with a range of pickles and also a serious amount of avocado. Great flavours, look forward to coming back. Price is decent for the meal you receive that is for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNheXJhNGV3EAE,Their raw fish are super fresh and they actually use real wasabi which not many Japanese restaurants does. The staff are super friendly and attentive we had a very good time there. Especially after lockdown thank you guys! Ps. Yuzu cocktail is the cocktail to go ü§© ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNnFlVWVREAE,"Mentaiko udon is bloody freaking delicious. The only con is you never know when they're open? I've walked back dreaming of mentaiko udon, but then find they're closed even though Google says they should be open :( perhaps call up to double check before booking"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3ZPd3lnRRAB,"Not a izakaya Japanese restaurant , this is joint with their Korean restaurant. Charging 10% on Sunday ‚Ä¶ not normal"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdU9UNWlnRRAB,"A bit pricey for what the dishes are. Most items are above what you get in a Japanese restaurant (same sort of quality) your typical sashimi and sushi combo. Tried the chirashi, ok portion but the rice is over seasoned. The miso soup is way too salty than it needed to be. The good news is the Korean menu seems a lot better (yes you can order Korean dishes as it's a joint restaurant) and the alcohol is fairly reasonably priced. $14 for a 300ml sake. $19 for cocktails (2 pp per serving). In conclusion, great place to drink but not ideal to dine for the asking price (pretty street food vibe not izakaya...)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOGEtRkpREAE,Love their lunch-time sushi! Great and variety of offerings
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbTl1TUNBEAE,"Located in a small alleyway, Nana Izakaya is one of the two restaurants there. It‚Äôs sister restaurant is a Korean restaurant called Seven Star Pocha. When you enter the venue, the two restaurants are actually connected despite each having its own entrance.  On this visit we had sashimi and sushi as our entrees. The sashimi was available in three sizes; small, medium and large while the sushi was available as small with 6 pieces and main with 13 pieces. Both of these were fresh and beautifully presented.  For our mains we chose two nabe dishes. Nabe is a hotpot which is cooked in a portable gas stove at the table. We were advised that nabe is designed to be shared between 2-3 and we think this is true if you plan to have entrees and other smaller dishes but as a main, we could finish a nabe each.  We had the wagyu nabe and sake fish nabe. And our favourite was the wagyu nabe which had a variety of mushrooms, tofu, glass noodles, cabbage and wombok in a sweet mushroom broth. While the sake fish nabe was as described with shell fish already cooked to 'well done' and layered on top with a layer of cabbage at the bottom."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcHRUamhRRRAB,"Absolute gem of a restaurant, serving up a delicious variety of izakaya-style Japanese food! My favourites were the Unagi Roll and Mentaiko Cream Udon. All the food was very fresh and the service was lovely and attentive throughout the night, without being overbearing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNHUzdXZBRRAB,"Loved dining here at Nana Izakaya. The sashimi and oysters were super fresh and delicious. We also got some yummy unagi sushi. I ordered the creamy mentaiko udon with egg yolk, highly recommend, while my partners ordered some ribs, very generous portions! Staff were super lovely and it‚Äôs a cute little spot. Also if you like soju, the presentation was so fun and loved the refreshing but not overly sweet taste of the fruity soju cocktails"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb0ltT3lRRRAB,"Good service and nice ambiance. Run by Koreans, the food is good but too pricey for what it is. A pity. Got a jug of Black Asahi, large sashimi, 1 sushi roll, 3 entrees and it was $80 a person. For that price tag, I‚Äôm expecting to be blown away. The fried chicken was tasty but not extremely crunchy, loved the wasabi octopus, sashimi were good but small‚Ä¶"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bkpCdBAB,√Çmzing food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N0pycktBEAE,its bit expensive but delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N1BDYlhBEAE,Corn cheese was amazing!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekktaS1nRRAB,"I ordered a lot of meat and chicken successfully, but I'll come and try that one later :D"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU5tTjdRRRAB,It's delicious. I come to eat with my colleagues after work. I recommend chicken feet and spicy pork kimchi soup
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MUppM05nEAE,Very nice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE8zVEtBEAE,Excellent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bFBHOUtnEAE,"Nice one, need have a try"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bExHRjN3RRAB,Honey Soy Fried Chicken is the best!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eU1fcXdBRRAB,good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eU1tOW1BRRAB,"Great place for late nights. Really enjoyed our meal, food was amazing and portions are huge."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b091Yy1nRRAB,Food was great & came really quick! Friendly staff & atmosphere. Highly recommended
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b01PN2RREAE,Seven Star has one of the best fried chicken in Melbourne. Snowing Cheese Fried Chicken is definitely a go-to.  Portion are OK for the price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0otRDl3RRAB,"Great place for a late night Korean feed! My mates and I are regulars here for drinks and food especially late night as they open later and still busy around 11pm on weekends.  Food is fantastic and comes quick and hot with very generous portions.  Army stew, KFC, glass noodles, corn cheese  and all your Korean favourites are ü§å"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSXzdDVVlREAE,Extraordinary service from Katity! Best recommendations and lots of Soju
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdi03Skd3EAE,Amazing restaurant Open late so always a time to come and have a hearty meal
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWNXNUNBEAE,Ox Tail!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbWZfd1V3EAE,F*** amazing sandwiches ü•™ get there now.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWM3WGNBEAE,"Fresh, juicy and yummy! Definitely, this is one of the best sandwiches we have tried so far in Melbourne. Chicken schnitzel was favourite but Mushroom toastie was delicious too. It has its own uniqueness and would highly recommend it! There were a few sitting arrangements as well. It remained crowded most of the time. But the service was pretty quick."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVk3Yk93EAE,Small sandwich and the guy at the front had attitude when I asked for no mustard. Quite expensive for what it was. Was filled with lettuce which just became very overpowering
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjVEX2FREAE,"For sure this is a perfect sandwich (the Cuban). $17 is steep but yeah, it's perfect and they know it. I got lucky in going when it wasn't too busy so the wait wasn't long and I was able to grab one of their few laneway tables. Will return to try other sandwiches."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3NYdThBRRAB,Overall 4.4/5 Local sandwich ü•™ we had the truffle mushroom sandwich but they ran out of the gluten free bread ü•≤ but that‚Äôs okay. The sandwich was good and well- seasoned but I find it a little too salty but still good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEttTWR3EAE,"Great sandwich shop, i tried the cubano and it was certainly delicious. Will be back to try the others."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjk2SDBBRRAB,"So delicious! the cubano and mushroom melt are sensational, will be back to try the other sandwiches."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLXJQUm9BRRAB,"Be prepared to wait, but the sandwiches are good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOV9XVmRREAE,"It is a great little whole in the wall kind of setup. I had the cubano and it was good, however could have had more meat, especially when you pay $17 for a sandwich."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoanJYdEZBEAE,The mushroom melt is a revelation! Amazing x
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHJfdXR3RRAB,"Another hidden gem down an alleyway, sandwiches are massive, filling and yum."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdzZLSVV3EAE,"I would rate the Clyde Nth store the worst in the area. Both Berwick stores, Cranbourne Nth and Fountain Gate are much quick and fewer mistakes. I waited more than 10 minutes in the drive thru tonight, to get home and realise they‚Äôd messed the order up. Understand young people work there, but management need to give better direction"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNnQ3UjJnRRAB,It‚Äôs January 17th and your doors are still closed. Business must be that good aye. I‚Äôm sure the casual staff are really enjoying the break scrambling to find work until you decide to pull your finger out and open up again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMnFXMEhnEAE,"Nikos has truly made a name for itself as the place for a good sandwich and coffee. Every morning and afternoon for breakfast and lunch, there are lines of people waiting to get their orders in. Of course I had to try to see if it lived up to the hype.  I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel sandwich and my goodness was it delicious. Unlike your usual schnitzel sandwich with lettuce and mayonnaise (not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with the classic), this was a harmonious combination of the bread, cheese, sauce, pickles and dill which took centre stage with the schnitzel as an accompaniment. With that being said, the chicken was beautifully cooked and rather than minced chicken, it was crumbed chicken breast so it was super juicy and tender.  Highly recommended and yes it lives up to the hype. Can‚Äôt wait to try the Cubano Melt next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeW9DU0hnEAE,"Great sandwich spot! We ordered the Cubano and Tuna Melt sandwiches. They were both great! A bit of of a wait - but well worth it. Seating was limited, but we walked over to Flagstaff Gardens and had a nice picnic. The menu is posted, but I recommend looking online if you're wanting more details about the ingredients. Definitely recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZ3NDR19RRRAB,"The best, most expensive sandwich ever. But worth it. Rrreeaalll gggoooddd!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbVlISlRBEAE,The best sandwich (vegan schnitzel sandwich) I have had till today.  Will visit more often now
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM05UTGR3EAE,"Awesome Sando, great coffee, lovely service!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteE9TenJRRRAB,Perfect work lunch stop! Got the chicken schnitzel which was delicious!! Can‚Äôt wait to go back to try more üòã  Follow hangryhelena on Instagram for more food content ü•∞
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcjdfVUpREAE,"This place is great, the Sandwhiches combinations are really tasty, even tho I ordered delivery through DoorDash sandwhich was still hot.  The Coffee is nothing special but thats not why you come here. Some of these sandwiches are absolutely filled to the brim.  I recommend this place if you're looking for a great toasted sandwhich for breakfast."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtalluUXNRRRAB,I love that they have flowers on the tables! Obviously from the florist next door?! That's a lot of community love üòç  Their truffle mushroom beats Cubano pork! Makes me wanna try their vegetarian sandwich next time!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzhPd1BBEAE,"Have been here twice now, and LOVE the food. Absolutely delicious,  has me.missing it from afar. Would give 10 star if I could."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGV1NG93RRAB,Really good coffee. Nice food and prompt service!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGRPRDJ3RRAB,"absolutely beautiful food, service was top notch."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGFYNTF3RRAB,I ordered a beef burger from here and he served it to me raw and it wasn‚Äôt just rare it was raw I took it back and told them it was raw and he said no that‚Äôs the way we cook it and I asked can I have a more burnt one and he brought it back out on the same cut up bun and beef I took one bite and it was horrible and then I left and the place was very dirty and found dirt all over the floor. I came here for the high reviews and way very disappointed and the beef burger was 21$ not worth it at all smoothie was good tho but if your looking for a nice meal go somewhere else cause u won‚Äôt find it here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWFIa0RBEAE,Delicious food in the center of Melbourne! Coffee was great and so was the food!  Staff were friendly and lots of seats  I‚Äôll be back!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnZPYXhBRRAB,"Disappointing. Avacado was tart and awful, as was the tomato. Leads me to believe produce was towards the end of its life.  Configuration towards the end of the cafe is confused, and clearly was never measured out properly, with tables sitting alongside a booth."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnRLOXl3RRAB,"Great service, coffee is really good Breakfast is also amazing and delicious.  The only thing i would say they could benefit of small floor renovation"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUpENlRREAE,"Great service and terrific food thanks to Jazz, Bunty and team!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2Y3M3F3RRAB,"We entered  Cafe court this morning,  I ordered  the big brekky,  the  breakfast  was sensational,  also the coffee is the best ever. I'm so glad we stopped here. I highly  recommend  this Cafe. Not much wait time for our  meals. Superfast, also friendly  staff. 10/10....‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2I2eVVBEAE,One of the best dine in brunches I had. The coffee is fantastic. The meal was superb! Very reasonably priced. Great service. Food came out very quickly. Highly recommend this place. Will definitely be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN29DSXdBRRAB,Awesome open on a Sunday. Food was nice and the service was wonderful.  Price good too. I'm a self average expert on coffee and there Long Mac topped up in a glass extra hot was very good. Keep up the good service with a smile it makes a big difference to cafes that don't know how to be engaging.  üôÇüëç
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXNuYVV3EAE,Great breakfast ü•£
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSelB1ckVBEAE,One of the best breakfast i we ever had in our life
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMS1TX2R3EAE,"Very tasty cappucino, eggs Benedict were so good. We have been there 2 days in a row now, the service yesterday was super nice. Unfortunately, the lady was a bit unfriendly today, especially by Australian standards. Therefore a star deduction."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDZuVVFBEAE,"Fantastic breakfast options, friendly service, huge portions! The fresh squeezed juice was quite pulpy so could do with a strain, but otherwise delicious and fresh. Prices were decent, lower than expected. This cafe is unassuming as you walk by, but don‚Äôt be fooled it‚Äôs one of the best breakfasts in the Melbourne CBD. You‚Äôd be crazy to pass up the pancakes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc196YnR3RRAB,They make a good scrambled eggs & bacon. Service was quick too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNGRfY1hnEAE,Was really really good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1p6VDhBRRAB,"Happy that I found the cafe open till late, 5pm for lazy myself"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM2M2bVFBEAE,Got the Eggs Benedict and the hollandaise sauce was the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. Very friendly and accomodating service from the staff too! :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoblktNERREAE,"Big portions, give their own twist to dishes and good taste. We went there twice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOXF2NWtBRRAB,Inner city cafe for workers given its practical interior layout. GENEROUS servings. Good menu. Good luck finishing the pancakes!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDRtWnJ3RRAB,"The food is served super fast, and it is very delicious. Every time I come, I eat the buttress..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWM2b1BBEAE,"I ordered crayfish noodles and the large intestine was not cleaned Gastroenteritis infected with bacteria after eating, diarrhea for a whole week and still in the hospital  Then a certain male clerk served the dish and couldn't tell the name of the dish with a bad attitude! Fried rice is unpalatable, the only thing that is sincere is the super large bowl of white rice The hot and sour fish soup is very salty and unpalatable. Please add more water. It is barely drinkable after being boiled, and the round table cannot slide  I won't trust Little Red Book anymore"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWJ2MWlBRRAB,"Occasionally, I will visit Melbourne, and I came to Chibi through a friend‚Äôs introduction. Because there are only two people dining together, I only ordered lobster noodles and palm treasure. It‚Äôs really amazing~ It‚Äôs delicious. They say their house is the ceiling of Sichuan cuisine in Melbourne, not at all. Too much. . ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHRLVE9nEAE,"One of the best chinese food restaurants in Melbourne üí´ We‚Äôve ordered their ‚ÄúPickled Fish‚Äù ÈÖ∏ËèúÈ±º where the broth tastes sour but makes you feel like digging in more every sip! The fish slices in the soup is so soft and fresh, thinly sliced yet so yummy. Also highly recommend their chicken soup with fish maw Ëä±ËÉ∂ where it contains heaps of collagen! Something else that we‚Äôre also happy to reorder - Stinky Tofu Ëá≠Ë±ÜËÖêÔºåShredded Cabbage with Vinegar ÊâãÊíïÂåÖËèú üíó"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScW9UTGNREAE,"The truffle fried rice is delicious, but the crayfish noodles taste a bit salty with garlic, the lotus root slices are delicious, the stir-fried pork is also good, the roast duck is okay, but the crust is too oily"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkxyV3BnRRAB,"It tastes great! The amount was so large that it flew off, two people finished eating and packed it, and ate it all day the next day!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVBhRUZnEAE,"It takes a long time to wait. And the waiter‚Äô attitude is bad. It looks like someone owe him money. The good comment was given by fake customer who want to the free watermelon juice. The dish is just so so. It‚Äôs not worthy it to wait such long time. And the ground is so dirty, when you walk, you could feel your feet is sticky to the floor. It seems that they clean the floor not often."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVBENXN3RRAB,"The environment is good, but not authentic Hong Kong-style dim sum. Shaomai is similar to pork balls. The taste is average. Just this once."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUtIT1h3EAE,Had the chilli pork. Great portion size and taste. Definitely curious to try more of their offerings. Restaurant was very busy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNDRiaklnEAE,"One of my favour Chinese Sichuan food restaurants in the town. No doubt that all dishes had authentic Sichuan flavours. I always order takeaways from Red Cliff when I go to friend's apartment in the city. They like Red Cliff's food as well. But one of the problems is they can't read Chinese on the delivery app and often it's hard to judge what ingredients the dish has based on the English menu on the app. The other problem is in most cases, delivery guys also don't speak English. lol. I really hope more people would come to know Red Cliff, as they present true taste of Sichuan food, have generous proportion and reasonable prices. Recommend dish: layer tofu with chili and sliced pork, roast lamb with cumin"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0k3NHVnRRAB,"Great food, generous portions and very authentic indeed.  The popcorn chicken wasn't for me so I wouldn't recommend anyone to get it. But the lobster noodles was amazing ü§©"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd04ybWVREAE,"delicious and big portionüëçüèªüëçüèª  we ordered: the sour pickled fish, salt pepper pork ribs, some chicken dish(forgot the name), some veggie with garlic‚Ä¶. all yummm strong flavours which i like  service also not bad will come back on next melbourne trip"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd05hbzFBRRAB,"I ordered their chongqing hot pot at 9.45pm and got home and check there was barely anything inside, compared to the past where the was a lot of things inside, the spam ham wasn't cooked properly, very hard to eat had to throw it out, waste of money, don't order things when it's about to close they don't cook their things properly only thinking about scamming your money, I'm really upset as a regular customer, u would do this to me, you should be ashamed yourselves"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjl5Uk9BEAE,"Great food and service is fine, they r super busy so I guess that‚Äôs why the slow service. Not a very baby friendly place as well but otherwise most of the food we ordered is delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSODdXck13EAE,"The taste is not bad, and the Taier Pickled Fish feels quite authentic. The dipped tofu curd has the taste of childhood! (Sichuan people should understand it!)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2VmZnBBRRAB,Big portion and good taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGN1NUJBEAE,The waitress installs me to withdraw 5min later telling me that the table is reserved and sends me back to the door of the restaurant.  Unheard of in catering.  The kitchen may be good if you are lucky enough to be able to taste it ü§°

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd04zOEJBEAE,Highly recommend! Friendly staff as well!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeVpTN2J3EAE,"Dry, tasteless, overcooked food but the service was friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNa2NMTnR3RRAB,Great variety of foods . But that results in unfresh food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwOHN6QWpBRRAB,Don't get sides they are pricy. But food is good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbE5tbWF3EAE,Cheap and cheerful asian. Beautiful Combination Stuffed Laksa.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcll6NmRREAE,"Fantastic little shop, that I highly recommend. Food is reasonably priced and always delicious, and the staff are always so bubbly and cheerful (even after my friend has broken their EFTPOS Machine on three separate occasions...).  The wait times here can be a little all over the place - sometimes meals are served within minutes and sometimes you can find yourself waiting, but it's always been worth it. I suggest the Kung Pao chicken - it doesn't pack quite the punch, and Nathan likes his chicken spicy - but it's jammed full of flavour!  Definitely come and try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVM3VXSVlBEAE,The food was fresh and filling.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmVlZzh3RRAB,Underwhelming and bland. The African spiced lamb with couscous looked good but lacked any real spice and was quite watery.  My partner‚Äôs seafood paella had the saddest looking defrosted prawn I‚Äôve ever seen accompanied by thawed salmon(?) and thawed mussels. The rice was also dry and it was evident there was no saffron used at all.  Given the location on Hardware lane absolutely avoid this venue as there‚Äôs so many good places nearby. The one upside I found was they do Erdiner on tap.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2UyRUNnEAE,The food tasted great and the staff were quite friendly taking our order and serving us. Bigger portion sizes would've been nice but the quality is definitely there for the food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2Z5alp3EAE,"Great service and food, lots of seafood options as well as vegetarian"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXB5NVBBEAE,"Super friendly service, loads of great food options, especially seafood, but also good vegetarian food too.  Highly recommend the calamari."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLU1TU1lnEAE,Delicious food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTRTTHdnRRAB,"The worst sea food, we have had in a very very long time. Thanks God the waiter though his memory was better than pen and paper, forgot 2 serves of the pepper calamari üôè only 1 came out.  The clam chowder was so watery and green, disgusting. How do you call that clam Chowder, the chef needs a cooking session from Richmond oyter bar.  Im surprised these guys are still in business"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeTV2aHJnRRAB,Good food and excellent service. They have live music.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNlo2U2hRRRAB,Bad experience ordering the seafood plater. Visited the restaurant with the expectation of the seafood  plater for 2 displayed on google. Checked this with waiter who assured us that was the one. Then serviced a small plater on a large plate and told it was googles fault. The plater was very over priced at $105 and really a servicing for one person. OK the seafood was tastey and service quick.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdnFueW5RRRAB,Awesome place to be yourself with best quality products and ambient...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHFxSTN3RRAB,"We‚Äôve been to Claypots in St Kilda a few times, but it was our first visit on Hardware Lane. The menu is quite different - seems to have more seafood options - which we loved, and it was all absolutely delicious!  The waiter was very kind, quick and assertive when asking for recommendations. The only downside of our experience is that the chairs outside are unfortunately very uncomfortable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3FTTlRBEAE,"Such a great selection of restaurants in this laneway, but Claypot drew us in for their diverse & unique menu.  As other people have said, service is a bit hit & miss....but the Food, Omg the food! Will be back next time, for sure!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoai1laC1BRRAB,"Food & service excellent,  we had two dishes one being sardines which was perfect, would go again anytime."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobF83ZVpREAE,The food is great and the beautiful Valentina made this an amazing experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob2MtT1JBEAE,Amazing venue tucked away in the city. Live music to suit the atmosphere and the best marinara around. Must try for couples or small groups looking for a refreshing afternoon of food and wine
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScThUcHFRRRAB,I had a brownie. It was fine - it was well priced (only $3.80) and service was prompt. The brownie was a bit dry though. I'd come back for a cheap snack if needed but would probably target elsewhere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeElhX29nRRAB,Used to be one of my go to around Aug to Oct 2022. Then the roll became so small. The price listed EXCLUSIVE of 10% surcharge on a normal day which they dont notice anywhere. 9.20 per roll and ridiculous extra $1 for a rude staff repeatedly telling me 10.20 without saying anything bout the surcharge
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXR6OXdRRRAB,"One of the person attending was using her phone with glove on and then preparing sandwiches!! Today's chilli didn't taste good.  Also they girls are so loud, they should have some respect for others that we dont speak their language."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobFl1ZUdnEAE,Smells upsalutly amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoelB1ZjJnRRAB,"Delicious homemade baked goods, sandwiches and drinks. A very lovely family run it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeW9yd2hRRRAB,Update your hours!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtem8zS3ZRRRAB,"I eat here regularly minimum of once a week , the sandwich rolls here are so delicious! The bread rolls are home made daily which just makes it that extra bit more tasty, they have a huge range of options for the fillings and toppings I usually get the Turkey or chicken schnitzel the sandwich rolls  are also very cheap considering how fresh and filling they are they are usually around $5.00 - $10.00 depending on what you get. they also offer pies and other Pastry‚Äôs which are all home made as well, they also offer other hot  dishes and salads which are very cheap, this Kenny‚Äôs is one of the cleanest freshest/ tastiest and busiest I have seen before the staff are so lovely and such hard workers. Also the hot drinks taste fantastic too!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlc2V2S2F3EAE,Great Pie!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OTVhR0pREAE,"I bought a pork roll this afternoon, within an hour it went straight through me. Food poisoning hands down, the meat had obviously been sitting there for far too long."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dm9QSEl3EAE,"No words. Good food and coffee, highly recommended"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c3M2RWhRRRAB,"They put a complimentary tomato sauce on your sausage roll, you dont get that back in New Zealand üëç ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdi1XQU5REAE,The roast or whatever smells so strongly it fills Collins St and makes me gag. Contain your stink! Get some exhaust fans.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnNpN053EAE,A serviceable place for banh mi in the CBD at great value.  Good cheap eat in the CBD and decent taste. I had the Vietnamese pork roll for the authentic banh mi experience.  Banh mis are priced at around $9.  They also do various types of banh mis with several non traditional toppings; like normal rolls with a banh mi base.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bDYteElnEAE,Very popular with the city crowd. I love the chicken schnitzel roll with lettuce and Mayo.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMGFXckl3EAE,GREAT BANH MI SERVED WITH A SMILE This Kenny's outlet is in the legal preceint in Melbourne's CBD. It is a good option if you are after a quick takeaway lunch. Banh Mi is pretty good - fresh ingredients and a range of meat and vegetarian options. Also serves a good cup of coffee to go as well as meat and salad in a bowl (kind of Vietnamese version of Poke bowl). Friendly staff and efficient service. People with mobility issues will be fine as it is on one flat level with no steps or entry doors to negotiate.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhNkxHUWNnEAE,Best.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdE5PUFp3EAE,Nice service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNmNTeTN3RRAB,Friendly staff and the ladies are lovely. Food is tasty and reasonably priced.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOGFqYkVnEAE,Pies pretty ordinary. Also was given the wrong flavour and couldn't get a refund
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOS1qMXJ3RRAB,"Very rude staff, eventhough they made mistake by taking wrong orders and they will show you attitude with their expression and throwing the food away, banging the kitchen tools. The rolls were very dry and hard, not consistent. The coffee is a big failure. Will never ever step into this store."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLM0k2VWNBEAE,Donut tastes bad. Too soft like have placed for 2 weeks
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbC1Ec2FBEAE,"Fast and delicious sandwiches in rice flour rolls. Choose from salads, roast pork, chicken, schnitzel or other options."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX2Rhb3RBRRAB,Quick and delicious traditional Vietnamese Pork Rolls. Can‚Äôt go wrong!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLamNyX3dRRRAB,Great causal place to go for a quick and tasty lunch. Plenty of space for eating in and takeaway available too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX0o2UzJRRRAB,I have been a fan of Kenny's from their early days ( when they were opposite to where they are now). Their chicken salad roll is always our goto. Always so fresh.  I haven't been back in over 2 years as I live interstate but I went there towards the end of last year and grabbed myself a chicken salad roll. Still the same.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLelBxT0pnEAE,Reasonable price in CBD with very kind and friendly staff. Will come back again ü§© coffee is nice in a very big cup üòç ‚Ä¶

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXNUWU1BEAE,A nice Korean restaurant located in the CBD. The highlights were the fried chicken and the drinks.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXZQMXJRRRAB,I found a good restaurant when I was looking for lunch. I went with two Korean colleagues. The food I ordered was very authentic and delicious. I will come again next time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjhuczl3RRAB,Seriously crazy good food. I came here with my friend after visiting years prior and it was as good as my distant memories. The waitress was surprised we knew how to enjoy bossam and seemed to be very pleased. She was very cute! Will be coming back again with more friends!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScy1IUHJBRRAB,"I already ate cold noodle in many place but this one give me feel the best because this taste so fresh but I hope they can put more colder. It can make this taste perfect If you come to this restaurant. Please try sangye tang (ginseng chicken), it so nice and feel good after done this meal"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnJDbEh3EAE,Great experience here. Food was super tasty. Would definitely est here again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocVlUbU13EAE,Yukhoe Bibimbap Yukhoe is so fresh „Ö†„Ö† Yukgaejang and glass noodles were so delicious. I think I will go again next time !!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3VqSlNBEAE,We were craving Korean fried chicken and came across Mook Ji (I feel like I came here a few years back but not for KFC). The fried chicken was tasty and fresh. Absolutely no complaints at all. The Korean girl on cashier was also friendly. Would definitely return.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3NJZxAB,There is a lot of meat and all the side dishes are delicious!!‚ù§Ô∏è The staff were so kind and it was a pleasant dinnerüëçüëç Is really good and clean!! every staff so kind‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëç
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNG9HTWFBEAE,Food and interior - below average. Service is mediocre. We wanted korean bbq and this was the only place open that time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX05IdExnEAE,"Great food and nice staff, all assisted with cooking. We ordered only the add-ons (wagyu, scotch fillet, and vegetables) and not the whole set but was still very filling. Cool and fun music. Clean place and not as smoky, as compared to other k-bbq. Talk about UH-MAZING dessert! YUM!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M1BmSnZRRRAB,"My partner booked the restaurant for Saturday night dinner, because the atmosphere looked great online, the interior  looked very cute, and the reviews were very good.  HOWEVER, we had a terrible dining experience. I normally don‚Äôt leave bad reviews, but mainly the music was just TOO LOUD considering the dining atmosphere that the restaurant tries to portray? I‚Äôm not joking when I said my partner and I had to YELL and still couldn‚Äôt hear a thing. üòìüòìüòì  (I thought live music of cello and violin would be very classic, elegant and beautiful, but they played extremely loud pop music one after another and personally it just doesn‚Äôt match with the atmosphere.)  We ordered crispy pork belly with egg and duck curry. The first time they gave us the crispy pork belly, it was COLD. After telling the waiter about it, they then gave us a fresh one. But it was just okay‚Ä¶ the meat was really chewy and not crispy.  Overall I was disappointed. The only good thing was that the staffs were helpful and friendly. Might be a better place for a big crowd (seems like their targeted customers anyways)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck1mWEhnEAE,The food was amazing. Hats off to the musician amazing song selection and loved his work. Will definitely be back soon
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mk9fX0ZnEAE,Absolutely amazing!! A 10 out of 10 for their wonderful service and food. Easily one of the best Thai food in Melbourne!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUtTV2ZBEAE,Great ambience and fantastic live music on Saturday night! What a place to be. Definitely coming back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c09iR0J3EAE,We had a great time at the restaurant. Friendly staffs and quality food. Thank you for the birthday‚Äôs balloons and cake.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczd1anhBRRAB,Nice sitting for dinner and food Is tasty yet limit choice with live music.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScllUNml3RRAB,"The Wanderer is a cozy and welcoming bar located on Lonsdale Street in Melbourne. The ambiance is relaxed and comfortable, with plenty of seating options both inside and out. The decor features rustic wood paneling, dim lighting, and vintage touches that add to the cozy vibe. The drinks menu is impressive, with a wide selection of beers, wines, and cocktails on offer. The staff are knowledgeable and happy to offer recommendations based on your preferences, making it a great spot for those who want to try something new. The food menu is small but well-executed, featuring share plates and light bites that pair perfectly with your drinks. The Wanderer is a great spot to catch up with friends or have a quiet drink on your own. The service is friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is perfect for a low-key night out. If you're looking for a relaxed and comfortable bar in the heart of Melbourne, The Wanderer is definitely worth checking out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWY2VnlnRRAB,"Great atmosphere at this restaurant. Live music and really friendly staff. The stand out dishes for the night were the beef rendang and the broccoli with roasted port. We also enjoyed the desert during the night. If you enjoy spice, just order chilli on the side. Overall. Great restaurant for group of friends to catch up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanYyWTR3RRAB,Had a birthday dinner at this venue. Staff were friendly and always checking on how our night was. Amazing live musicians. I'm definitely going back again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHVlVGNREAE,"Bit overpriced with the portion of quantity provided. Apart from that, great ambience and good service provided with background live music and all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNeHFHMjZBRRAB,"*edit came back after covid and surprised at the standard of the food... Atmosphere still great with live music. Service is good. We ordered pad Thai and it lacked flavour. Ratio of noodle and bean sprouts was off. I normally enjoy bean sprouts, but for me to have a mouthful of mainly beansprouts was not pleasant. The crispy duck curry was not rendered properly and definitely not crispy. Soggy duck and the flavours in the curry weren't balanced properly. Quite disappointed.  3 years ago this place was good....Ambience was very good with live music on a Saturday night. Staff was friendly and attentive. We ordered the duck curry and the Tom yum soup was made depending on how spicy you requested, both were full of flavour and delicious. Had the coconut pandan cup which was sweet and savory, great dessert to end the night. Would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM0wzRVhnEAE,Good sized and priced food.  Nice atmosphere. There was live music the night we were there.  Staff were polite but could have been more attentive.  We would return.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa0ppTmVnEAE,Food and service were good the live music on Friday was bruh. The guy was playing trumpet or sth with the original songs playing in the background. Most of the songs are outdated and annoying.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEp1MWhnRRAB,"Great Thai restaurant with a nice vegan section of the menu.  The decor is whimsical, not your typical Thai restaurant, but I quite liked it.  This is elevated Thai dishes, done in share portions.  It's a bit more expensive, but I think it's warranted for the atmosphere, service and food is all of high quality.  My friends and I had an amazing dinner.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the smoked maple and miso old fashioned - I think the miso was overpowering and made the drink too salty which was not enjoyable.  Personal opinion, keep the smoked maple syrup as that's always a winner and to make it ""thai"" maybe garnish with a thai specific citrus like thai lime or maybe use the leaf as an aromatic with the orange."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScF9PQ25nRRAB,Excellent food and very kind staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2ZQek9BEAE,Good food and amazing live music
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGIzZ3ZBRRAB,"Probably the best service I've ever had. The table was for a hens event .The live music from 6pm was great , the food was delicious and came out fast and the service they provide was really accommodating as they set up balloons for us around the table free of  charge which was unexpected ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbXZqVWx3RRAB,#NAME?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlX1BTZk1nEAE,The only people that like the food here don‚Äôt know what authentic Thai food is  Come here if you want to be sitting for 30 minutes and not be served. Had to request for our order to be taken TWICE. We also had a booking. Don‚Äôt run birthday parties with other patrons at the same time if you can‚Äôt keep up with the demand. Was exciting to drink couple of cocktails too but not worth giving money away here. Don‚Äôt bother coming not worth it  Update- after having the food (especially the pork belly) i was sick. The amount of oil in there was terrible The rice was undercooked Some waitresses were nice The only dish I liked was the Tom yum out of the 4 dishes we got
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSek5HMGl3RRAB,"Very cozy restaurant with live amazing soothing music. Ordered fried rice recommended to try with spicy powder tastes yum! Spring rolls are fresh and must try. Fast service and friendly staff. Finally, roti will melt in your mouth üòã"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aklmazlRRRAB,FOH was very rude. Lol
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU1hZDVnRRAB,The worst thing is there services. They take online order and randomly served the food without asking name or what you have ordered & someone from large groups can eat your order. This services is worst I have ever experienced. The food quality is good but my bad review reflects their worst quality of service.

Their menu is packed with flavorful and fragrant dishes that will transport your taste buds straight to Malaysia. Whether you're a fan of satay skewers or spicy curries, there's something for everyone at Mamak. I highly recommend trying the roti canai - it's crispy, chewy, and perfect for dipping into their delicious sauces. Also morning glory stir fried and combination with the Tarik .The atmosphere at Mamak is always lively, with a bustling open kitchen and friendly staff who are happy to recommend dishes and make sure you have a great dining experience. If you're in Melbourne and craving Malaysian food, Mamak is the place to be!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOW9LemlRRRAB,"do you like roti canai? then head to mamak, watch the cooks twirl the roti over their heads as you queue for the pillowy, crunchy roti. good stop also for awesome authentic malaysian food, but watch out for death by sugar in their tea tereks!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWZma2N3EAE,"Very friendly and clean place with restrooms. I tried the canai roti, delicious. Also the kari ayam. Could have more vegies but they have kangkung. Can be pretty crowded at night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2FycHV3RRAB,"If you know what to get, Mamak is great. And it even has my Malaysian father-in-law's approval!  Top choices include the roti (perfectly flaky with savoury and sweet curries/sambals for dipping), the teh tarik (fluffy yet strong tea with just enough sweetness), the rojak and the nasi lemak. The curries and fried noodles/rice are also tasty but didn't leave the same impression.  I don't even know how many times I've been here. And the food has been consistent throughout."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnFPenVnRRAB,"Mamak is our all time favourite, and we are frequent visitors. All dishes are tasty, Satay, Nasi goreng, Ikan curry are the best.

The noodles are really flavourful and the lamb skewers, juicy. We have also tried the braised eggplant (slightly sweeter) which was quite nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE9IT2tBRRAB,"Halal restaurant where you can enjoy beef, chicken, lamb dishes full of flavour. The handmade noodles and skewers are a must try!! First time tried their homemade yoghurt drink - It was delicious! Reasonably priced with generous portions.  Friendly staff.  3 mnts away from Melbourne Central and 10mnts walk from Flinders. It was quite busy for a Thursday night so better book if you are heading on a weekend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEpyNTNnRRAB,"A mate took me here a few months ago, I didnt know what to expect, OMG this place was an eye opener in flavours. Delicious flavours and smell def must try! Good prices too, highly recommend. I had the lamb hotplate, special rice, lamb skewers and that package thing!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeTgtT0d3EAE,Lamb skewers are good but the minced beef in the buns are pretty dry. The noodles definitely needed to be eaten with a dish full of gravy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2RINE1nEAE,The lamb skewers are delicious and so succulent. It was my first time trying this cuisine and I‚Äôm very impressed! By far a great halal restaurant!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2ZEVWxRRRAB,Everything with this place is fantastic the food was amazing and the service I could not complain it's a must have to try
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGNQckpREAE,The lamb skewer neither taste nor look like lamb but chicken mixed with pasta.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWR6WW53RRAB,This has an authentic ugher food experience that is very different from the traditional Asian cuisine. You can tell the Turkic influence based on their menu. Their lamb skewers were the absolute best along with the dumplings. They were oozing with flavors that you won't find elsewhere. Highly recommended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnFidVJnEAE,"Checking on google the restaurants we knew were closed so we made the spontaneous decision to try this restaurant and it was definitely a great decision. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, the service was very pleasant and last but not least the food was fantastic. We ordered the noodles requesting no meat for our kids just vegetables alongside few other meals including the dumplings. Everything was packed with flavour and cooked perfectly and the portions were quite generous also. The pricing was very reasonable considering the price of meals now a days. My 8 years old son was so satisfied and happy with the food that not only he asked me to write the review but made sure to share his thoughts with the staff and giving them an in person 5 stars! Will definitely be coming back again. Thank you :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3B6TVpBEAE,Excellent food. You can‚Äôt go wrong with any of their meals. Skewers are a must try. Not to mention halal as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdktTMHVRRRAB,"The food is tasty. The waiter welcomed us warmly. The food portions were perfect, not too much and not small portions. Although the restaurant wasn‚Äôt spacious, it can serve/sits families and small groups."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdE43TkN3EAE,Delicious dishes. The Ziq Kawap lamb skewers and the Gosh Nan pancake are our favourites. The stir fries are also pretty good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSejhDTlRnEAE,"Very exotic flavor, the mutton skewers are delicious, with Xinjiang Uyghur characteristics, and the strips are also very strong, a good food experience"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajdXMzZRRRAB,If you can handle the spicy üî•ü•µ please ask for extra chilli for the kebab!!!!! It's amazing how hot it can be. Can't miss it!!! Ha ha ha ha
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScm9tZU13EAE,"Had really good Laghman noodles, although they were a bit oily, but it's probably how they are cooked traditionally. Will visit here again soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTdXLWVnEAE,"I loved eating here, and definitely will come back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbS1yLUZ3EAE,This what I got for 16$ quantity that worth no more than 5$. Wasted time....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMVpDbFV3EAE,We went to this restaurant with no expectations. I guessed it would have elements of Turkish and Chinese cuisine. This is partly true. I reckon 80% of the dishes has lamb as its main protein. It was also pleasantly spicy. The spice palate seemed more Middle Eastern but many of the cooking techniques and ingredients were more classically Chinese such as stir frying and noodles. Overall the atmosphere and staff were pleasant. The ingredients seemed fresh and the finished dishes tasted balanced without being bland.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScm9fQUdnEAE,"Great hospitality, friendly customer service and food is always very yummy and worth the commute! Have always been coming here and will continue to come when feeling like Uyghur. Highly recommend and won‚Äôt disappoint."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXNHUUd3EAE,"The food was delicious. My favourites were the lamb skewers, Gosh Nan, and Poshkal Qorumisi. The food came super quickly which is always a bonus!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXNyc0ZnEAE,This has been my favourite restaurant in Melbourne for a very long time. Food is authentic and delicious EVERY SINGLE TIME without fail. It's the first place I think of when I'm hungry in the city. 10/10
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXB5a3FRRRAB,Sweet little bar x I will be back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN3B1Z1h3EAE,"Cute bar, nice vibe, great music and live music"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcVBYNXpnRRAB,"Average experience, we had a group for a birthday looking to go up to the rooftop bar, we were told to sit at golden monkey as the rooftop was full, waited 30-45mins to finally be told that our group was too big. Very disappointing.  Only good thing I'd say is that the bartenders were great and made fancy shots for us.  I would've liked to have been told that our group was too big from the start so we could move on earlier instead of wasting time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNXN5aFNnEAE,"This place used to have a lot more cocktails, but the ones they have nowwere nice, really cool decor here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlX0tQZXpnRRAB,"Next night out destination sorted!‚ú®Transport yourself back to Asia with this Shanghai themed underground bar.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldi1HQUxBEAE,Amazing atmosphere and the staff is super friendly! Also food (steamed buns) I had were great too! I would recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTVPRlV3EAE,Bloody good vibes. Plus amazing house shot
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOC1xNkt3EAE,"You will love this hidden underground bar located at hardware lane in the city! Luckily we had a chance to enjoy a Thursday night live music session which is quite rare to find in the city, but @goldenmonkeybar is killing it. Serving beautiful potent cocktails and some scrumptious bao buns to keep the night going! Loved the cozy vibe here and warm service, and the live music sesh was a total mood add on.  We definitely had a blast!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eDdETlhnEAE,Good fun... good DJ & music...intimate and lively.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MjRDX2x3RRAB,"Absolute bomb hidden nightspot in the CBD with some Asian inspired interior, cocktails and food! Live music on every Thursday too! üòçüé∂üî• ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c19idl93RRAB,"Great place to gather with friends! Good food, drinks and atmosphere (especially with their local band on Thursdays). Service is fantastic too, definitely recommended!  Be sure to follow @melbbites on Instagram for more recommendations ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MU5EV0lREAE,Great vibe great cocktails
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NklMcGlnRRAB,Nice bar for after work drinks

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OUpqU1d3EAE,Great cocktails here! If you're looking for a bar that's a little more chilled out and the music is not crazy loud so you can actually hear what your friends are saying then it's a good choice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodzRhS1hBEAE,"The service is good, the meal is fast, the waiting number is shouted, pay attention to it, it is fun, ordered the Wagyu udon-the shop is more beef and fried chicken cutlet rice, it is a mixture of Chinese and Japanese styles, taste In general, the price is good. People who want to eat or noodle soup when traveling can consider eating and watching. It‚Äôs not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNDl5bktREAE,Nice fast food. Yummy soft serve cones!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTd5a0lnEAE,Food tasted very average and I got food poisoning from it. Not impressed. Won't be back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXall2bzBnRRAB,"Menu seems to have changed .... since 2019? The Salmon donburi in 2019 probably came with a onsen egg... not sure... but now its not there... its additional add on... but It's been awhile since we've dined out.... as always prices will always go up, never down and wages will remain stagnant! Inflation!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteGNmOVNREAE,"I ordered a grilled chicken curry dish that came out with the chicken boiled not grilled and the food essentially slop in a bowl. When I attempted to speak to the staff member about it, she walked away with total dis interest.  I allow myself to buy my lunch once a week at work and it went straight into the bin. If I could give 0 stars I would AVOID AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNGNMTGJREAE,"Ordered beef curry for takeaway, when I opened it,  it‚Äôs just rice and curry with a piece of carrot, where‚Äôs the beef?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMzZTVmZnEAE,"Lovely staff, quick service, food is so yum."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhZ3NySzlBRRAB,Great green tea soft serve but the machine seems to always be broken. And even then they never seem to have black sesame available anyway.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxazl5VFJREAE,"Ordered Tempura udon. Tempura was warm, crispy and delicious at serving. The soup was slightly plain, but reasonable for the price. The staff who served me was nice, but she was the only person working. Fortunately I did not have to wait long, but my friend who ordered after me was not as lucky."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeHJPUVhnEAE,"1 star for a good service Kimchi ‚ÄãBeef on rice - Kimchi had unusual strong smell, Beef was tasteless, and rice was mushy. And I got a stomachache afterwards. It may be because yesterday was an unusual hot autumn day."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bmFXVG13RRAB,"Food ok, ordered take away and they put hot soup and noodle together in one container, not very smart! I asked and the lady behind the counter laughed!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNV9QbUZ3EAE,Went yesterday and the food was average. My sister and I ordered the Chicken Katsu and Karage and we found there was a lot more rice to meat ratio which meant that we had a lot of rice left over. The salad was nice though. Also my brother got a ramen bowl with a clump of uncooked noodles in it which wasn't good. It wasn't bad and I understand a lot of places are reopening after being out of action for so long but we expected more especially from the photos online.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbXB5eEpnEAE,"Definitely not the place it used to be! Previously they served meals in larger bowls with excellent sized portions. This used to be one of our regular takeout spots. Now food is only served in smaller takeaway bowls, likely due to the pandemic, but the quantities we received of Teriyaki Salmon on Rice and Udon Noodles on Sunday were laughable. Had to order lunch elsewhere afterwards. If you've shrunk your serving portions,- fine. But please don't charge the same prices for less than half of what you previously served! Disappointed. Won't be coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTc0w3XzR3RRAB,"Horrible experience compare to other Rice workshop!!  Order a large and regular, the main difference was box size! What‚Äôs inside was of the same quantity!!  The beef lacks taste! Their kimchi is horrible and extremely sour!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpd3VfdFNnEAE,Very nice. Hubby had the angus beef bento and I had the grilled tofu.very pleased. Only one worker and very frendly and good customer service.  Was very busy but every one was patient and polite.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdmIzaFlBEAE,"Was just walking along china town street (Lt Bourke) deciding what to eat. This looked great. And it was tastes good. Quick to prepare. And quite cheap. Looked too delicious to hold back before photo. It was. I had curry with udon. Spouse had beef with rice. There is also some dishes available. We had tofu, vegetable patty and squid balls. All good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwOUxLdEl3EAE,"They have worst takoyaki i've ever eat before. Their takoyaki was tasteless, the octopus or squid because i dont even know if it's even octopus or not, taste like leftover grill squid. Ice cream was cheap and good, other fries food also good as well!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwMnBXYzZBRRAB,Bento box not good at all... not enough... edemame given frozen cold....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOE1tNkt3EAE,Average and serviceable food. But they have credit card surcharges. So removing a star for that.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNzVtalZBEAE,I‚Äôve only had their matcha and black sesame soft serve which are both bomb and for $2.50 you can‚Äôt go wrong.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajZ6U0VnEAE,"Very average taste, nothing special.  I will not go back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbnNxQVB3EAE,Good service.  We went at 2 pm do it was quite quiet.  The truffle potstickers was very moreish but 5 for 2 is always a bit awkward. It's a pity that you can't get an even number and pay the extra but maybe the computer billing can't cope. and very amazing üòç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3RDMjdBRRAB,"Step on the big thunder the service is ok, the environment is good‚Ä¶but the food was like‚Ä¶indescribably so salty the Xiaolong Bao was ok but very pale the roasted duck instead is toooo salty‚Ä¶ and the kongbao tofu is very salty too, shouldn't the kongbao tofu be sweet... Most importantly, The price was like 30/ppl, i really think the food does not deserve the price:/ I thought at this price, it wouldn‚Äôt be so unpalatable... The only thing worth recommending is the fried rice cake with shredded pork with shepherd's purse... as a Shanghainess family, we wont visit again‚Ä¶ üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDVmaWd3RRAB,The food quality is great. It's disappointing that my dessert came out before my main.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDdYLW1RRRAB,Best food can‚Äôt go wrong But order accordingly  Greens with chili and garlic Vegetables with noodles And prawn dumpling in peanut sauce Too good  2 people 3 dishers 1 coke 1 tea $74 and better then top Asian places I go
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod2FDRU5nEAE,Went after the lunchtime rush for a very late lunch so was seated immediately. Easy ordering system through the QR code on each table. Good selection of shanghainese favourites. Had the hot sour soup noodles. Taste and texture was authentic and delicious! Mid range price point but on par with most similar restaurants in Melbourne CBD. Convenient location in Emporium and not long to walk to Melbourne Central station. Good option if you're after good Chinese food after a day of shopping
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajlMWEx3EAE,The most disgusting meal I have ever endured. It tasted as if the staff microwaved old socks and served it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoai1MbHFnRRAB,Great dumplings and pork belly. Great serice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeS16c1NBEAE,I am getting spam calls in Chinese now from putting my phone number to order. Food was good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCa19XOFFREAE,Wonderful meal and very courteous staff. Would highly recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMnJLdUlREAE,I enjoyed the food and the cost of the dishes was okay. Recommendation for someone who likes Shanghaiese foods!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjhqYWRBEAE,"According to this place, the taste of Shanghai is... SALTY. The only person who would enjoy this much MSG is Uncle Roger. Copious amounts of tea were required to wash everything down, except there were no wait staff around. I had to serve my own family and collect extra crockery, take my teapot back to get more water and hunt for someone each time we needed something. Don't waste your time, this has to be one of the worst Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten at."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdnAtYVVREAE,"This is our family's go to dumpling place. With kids, parents and grandparents it has great access in the Emporium, cool atmosphere ( not overcrowded and squashed like some other place) and fast service (although not the most attentive staff) Pork dumplings are firm and juicy, and seafood dumpling's mouse texture has a great texture (much nicer than alot of other places). Soy and vinegar sauces compliment the dumplings nicely (some places they can be over powering). Favourites are Xiao Long Bao, Fried Pork Buns and Boiled Prawn dumplings. We've been going to New Shanghai/Shanghai taste since they started in Sydney and still go now as they are consistent in their dumplings."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbnFHaENBEAE,Nice service! Foods are really yummy. One of my favorite restaurants in Melbourne Centre. Staff are nice and kind.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcnVTeHNnRRAB,Food was decent but service was terrible. Food took over an hour to come at a non busy time and we had to ask three different waiters/waitresses to follow up. Wouldn't come back here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcjVEX2pnRRAB,"I ordered takeaways, the food looks out of date and tastes even worse. üò± Can't believe how come they still run business. üò¨ Never ever recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHR2aWN3EAE,I thought this was New Shanghai. It is not. It is now called Shanghai taste and the food is low quality.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHZMay1nRRAB,Nice Dumplings
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaElxcTNRRRAB,"Eleven people had dinner here. I have been here with small groups ,5 & 6 diners in the past. Dishes are shared. Typically Shanghainese so not sure what to expect. With eleven diners, we ordered six dishes (can order more if needed). Each dish was double , so worked out more than enough. Restaurant closes at 7:00pm. so to eat comfortably, must arrive at 6:00pm. We split the bill and we were surprised it was so cheap. Definately will come back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMTctNWNREAE,Very nice place~
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtM2ZDdm1RRRAB,"Absolutely enjoyed the foods that we ordered! Best I've had so far compared to other Chinese restaurants I've been to in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNWZlSUpnEAE,"yummy food, service was so good, staff were kind and helpful.  girl with tattoos on her arms was too sweet and told us about them, super cute. she knows who she is üòä"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaVlHVDh3RRAB,Nice brunch
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLVpuZGVBEAE,Such good food and service! smart way of ordering too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaUp5SWFBEAE,"The service staff is really sweet but the food came very extremely slowly. Also, this is the blandest Japanese food I ever had. The food was not good at all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteDhLXzJnRRAB,"What a place to eat, amazing customer service, clean, great atmosphere, the music and volume were perfect, food delivered to table on-time, very respectful and friendly staff, best quality food. All meals arrived hot, drinks were spot on. Definitely will come back many more times. Highly recommend this place to anyone who loves food. So far, my best ever restaurant experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNWFPN2RREAE,"Amazing food. The blonde girl who works there is nice, professional, with great customer service. Love it!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbHBicS1BRRAB,Amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNWFDbml3RRAB,Zac‚Äôs service is amazing. Give this kid a raise
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteXZ2QlRREAE,"Would definitely come again! The food and service was amazing, has a wide variety of food to choose from"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteXUzQ1JBEAE,"Absolutely beautiful! Atmosphere, staff and most importantly the food ! Delicious would definitely recommend. The hot stone steak was such a great experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX09mR1lREAE,My favourite place to go for lunch. Food taste so amazing!!! Price is also amazing!!! And also they have happy hours for beers! Highly recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ1A3V1VREAE,"Love the place , good service and food . Amber was good and helpful"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldXBubDFnRRAB,"The best dish i ordered was not the Gyoza but the ox tongue! Best environment and service, prawns are smaller than i throught but everything is delicious and well presented. Will visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldW9LV3NnRRAB,Nice food and nice sevice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldXN6bEZBEAE,Very nice food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldXBDNjFBRRAB,"The food was really good! Great ingredients, not too salty, just the right amount. Wide variety of choices to choose from."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0ltVF9nRRAB,Beautiful grilled oyster and scallops
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eDl2aElnEAE,Amazing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2NIOTZRRRAB,"A shopping centre hidden gem - the nautical theme is certainly unique and the lobster on the service table is hilarious. Great izakaya food with a good balance of portion v price - the kaki fry, gyoza and yakisoba are all super yummy. Highly recommend if you're on your lunch break while shopping!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X296cFZREAE,Supa good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dHRfcGZnEAE,Beautiful restaurant and helpful waiters. Price range is suitable for us lunch goers
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNDRXZjZ3RRAB,One of the good restaurants we love to go in Melbourne Emporium.  Good food and services.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbVlTOE13EAE,Very tasty
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybG9fZ2R3EAE,Stone grilled items were very nice and the menu was super cute
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycE5ERkRnEAE,Unfortunately not the best. Food was okay but short staffed so service suffered.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbktxV2lRRRAB,Best lobster bisque in town
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNzZLRUdnEAE,Lovely staff
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZzdhLTN3RRAB,"Beautiful  food! LOBSTER roll, ribs and deep fried cauliflower...a must !!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWJ5YnBRRRAB,"Decent place for a quick lunch in Collins Street. We ordered the Pho Tofu + Vegetable ($15.95) and varieties of Rice Paper Roll ($4.50 each).  The Pho was much more expensive than what you can get in other pho places, so it was very disappointing that it was plain and wasn't served with the usual plate of basil, chillies, and lime. I had to add a lot of sauces (which were luckily on the table) to add a bit more flavour.  The Rice paper rolls, however, were enjoyable and worth the extra price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeExYdWV3EAE,Tasty!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScV9PR2VBEAE,"Great lunchtime spot for fresh tasty Viet food. Add chilli, you know you want to..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodVpuN2ZBEAE,Best banh mi in the city
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWJHcVRnEAE,Love the food. Huge portion. A lot of sprouts which I love. Staff are very friendly as helpful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoektXanZRRRAB,Waited 20 mins for a  cup of pho. Not ideal for lunch breaks.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcS16ZEh3EAE,Great Beef Pho!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbXFpdW1nRRAB,Bad banh mi. Overly sweet. Even the bread was sweet. And too soft - not freshly toasted.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtamZMMFB3EAE,Bun not as good as Rolld and didn't give any coriander or bean sprouts as requested
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bWNpX19BRRAB,Pho can be better. Portion  and taste is inconsistent. Small amount of sliced beef - sometimes not enough noodles and soup is watered down if you arrive late or if the shop is busy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bVltSk5BEAE,Awesome food and people
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bktfellREAE,"Grabbed a late lunch here‚Ä¶ the food was good, it took a little while but I was there shortly before closing. Perhaps the baguette could have been crunchier but over all I really enjoyed it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPazZHei1RRRAB,"Good place to have Vietnamise pho.  Soup and noodle were fresh, warm enough, and  tasty to dine in for a lunch when it rains all day long outside.  Staffs were friendly, very welcoming, and knowing what they are selling.  Recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaVAzdFhREAE,Waited 20 minutes for a simple combo meal. Not sure if they were under staffed or just incompetent. Ridiculous.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaHVHSkR3EAE,Pho in a cup! WT.. Then when asked for a bowl I was told NO. Who eats pho out of a cup!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZ1lPbUlREAE,"Got a rice bowl with lemongrass chicken for lunch on Friday March 25th, the meat came medium-rare, which is not quite how chicken should be done. Unless you‚Äôre in a mood for salmonella stay away from this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeXBpZlZREAE,"Chicken ribs were pipping hot hawt! Yum  Pho was very average, if not below average? The meat was a bit on the thicker side (not the best). Broth was not that refreshing. I got a large and it was $14 but it had hardly any noods in it. If I‚Äôm paying more, I expect to have more. Definitely not the best pho, but not the worst either. It was an alright place for a quick lunch!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbU1PTldnEAE,"Ate the Salt and Pepper Chicken Ribs and the Pork Springrolls, both were tasty and reasonably priced at $15 for both."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck1HeGNREAE,"Great food, service and cocktails!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NE9tOW5nRRAB,Great food and casual relaxed vibe
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDhMWEJBEAE,"Set menu really was not great. I don‚Äôt know many places that get Asian fusion wrong but it wasn‚Äôt good. I think there was only one dish that seemed ok and that was the chive dumpling. The ‚Äúcigar‚Äù which was some weird flavoured spring roll dipped in cinnamon was so bad on so many levels. Only other dish that was ok was the pad Thai but even then, nothing to rave about. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been to a place and left so much food to waste. Food really was not good and service was also slow and non existent most of the night. The bar tender was so unfriendly. You can crack a smile or at least say hello. Really underwhelmed and disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRN0t6VGdBRRAB,"Great food, music and relaxed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScFlfU3dnRRAB,Nice place but expensive
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaFlEWWF3EAE,Great space but staff are lazy and rude. After about 10 minutes gave up and went elsewhere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3NMWkRREAE,The food was absolutely amazing! Enjoyed every part of the banquet served to us. Service was the best I've come across in years! Decor and vibe was also fantastic. Only suggestion would be that for large groups the space is quite loud and hard to hear. Suit smaller parties where you are seated nearer to each other.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXVlb3h3RRAB,Food delicious. Service impeccable. Special mention to Maya üòò ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXI3cW5BRRAB,"The Atmosphere 5 Star, the waitress 5 Star, the food 5 star (amazing) unfortunately the reason for the 4 star is I‚Äôm a little annoyed that the charge on my card was different to what I paid at the restaurant. I emailed requesting a response and that was nearly 2 weeks ago. Ruined my opinion of this place that deserves 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHYzbmNnEAE,"Service was friendly and quick, interior is fun and food options are great and really tasty. However the music was too loud so we needed to speak loudly to have a conversation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdE5LLTJRRRAB,Beautiful decor and fun. Our table however though was next to a wall and there was a bad smelling from pipes. Food was fusion and creative. We would prefer the crockery to be real ceramic to plastic as if feels cheaper and the food price was not cheap.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdEp5RU1REAE,Always a good spot for a cocktail
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaE9hMF9RRRAB,Lovely cocktails and beautiful food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMkpmanNRRRAB,Service is amazing. Food and beverage sublime.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb002TTN3RRAB,"Tasty Thai food and a huge selection of beverages, great staff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjdhbm9BRRAB,Without a doubt the best bartenders in Melbourne. Hats off to Tom & his team‚Ä¶ a guaranteed stellar night out. Pre or post show‚Ä¶ this spot is worth the stop! üç∏ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbS1UMC13RRAB,Absolutely fantastic. Came in early and had no idea what to choose. Liam our friendly waiter gave us excellent advice on what to order (as I thought we needed more) and it was perfect. Expect some spice and enjoy the atmosphere!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzliYTZBRRAB,"Good food and great cocktails. Staff were a mix of friendly and disinterested. Nice location but bit of a weird smell when you first walk in, toilets a bit manky. Food came reasonably quickly but the drinks prices were astronomical, I understand it being Melbourne CBD prices but 2 pints of lager and a coke for $39 üò±üò±üò±üò± Also the menu was a bit chilli themed (not a problem with me) but people with more mainstream/mundane tastes might be turned off."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZy1EQ0V3EAE,Good vibes nice lively ~ good mood
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd1k2U2tnRRAB,"Good food , good vibes the atmosphere is always welcoming ! However  staff should be more attentions to their guests in food selection. some guests not be looking for that hint of spicy spicy .. definitely a gem to check it out for a good dinnner /night out anytime in Melbourne would recommend it ! Cheers ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXJXLXZnRRAB,"Yummy food and drinks! The feed me menu offers a good amount of food, well enough. Really enjoyed it. The cocktails are also really nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXJTaWNBEAE,Pretentious staff and managers lying about a situation to cover themselves not worth the visit
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXMtejJRRRAB,"I've dined at Cookie multiple times, during the day, at night, etc. Unfortunately, compared to other 'scaled up' Thai restaurants, e.g. Longrain, and Sunda, Cookie is just not up to mark, with hit-or-miss food, order-at-the-bar service, plastic crockery etc., despite comparable pricing. That said, the staff are always kind and helpful. What Cookie does well is its drinks menu, which is much more diverse than other upscale Thai restaurants I've been to. Their flavour-pairing Daquiris are delicious, and trying different combinations is fun. I'd recommend going for a drink and snack with friends, and I'd advise sitting out on one of the outdoor terraces, as inside the restaurant can be pretty loud, and the view off Swanston street is nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN05UZndRRRAB,Food was... edible.  The best thing about the place was decent selection of beers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaEtQLXlRRRAB,"Incredibly chill vibes, perfect to escape to with some friends. The cocktail menu is extensive and all of the staff are kind and friendly and will help you find a drink you like. We sat on the small balcony which was a lovely breeze on a warm night.  Music is a little bit too loud for deep conversations, but not overwhelming. but a great way to gently warm up for a longer night out.  If you have low vision or sensory processing issues, the dim mood lighting may not be ideal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGRYRzVRRRAB,Not great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaGJuWVR3EAE,I went here in February and was charged for items I didn‚Äôt order. At first they were really understanding and admitted their fault and offered to pay back the extra items. Unfortunately they then ghosted me for months and haven‚Äôt responded. I had a nice time and the staff were lovely but I would never recommend anyone to come here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenFDNVlREAE,Visited for the Comedy Festival. Lovely intimate venue.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXNpOWRREAE,Very nice bar decorations and drinks üëå ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHVTMWRBEAE,"Booths were all booked out, drinks were expensive, but the comedy was good and the room well set up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdk4zRHV3RRAB,Great live improv music! And perfect for a late night out.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScE9YXzRRRRAB,Awesome!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUt5ZVZBEAE,Good workout climbing the stairs (elevator available). Comedy shows were great. Barstaff knowledgeable and friendly. Cozy atmosphere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNlBtekJREAE,lovely place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNl83b3BBRRAB,DJ's still got it ;-)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScFlDdWRnEAE,"Came here to booth out, when I booth out I need quiet jazz in the background, at the Toff the booths were loud but nonetheless worth it. #peaceandlove"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWFTLXBRRRAB,Slow service and terrible cocktail and mocktail.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWI2TU1REAE,Excellent vibe and music
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2NTMEp3EAE,"Stevie was awesome, really rose above and beyond and clearly knew her stuff. Thanks again for looking after the group!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMDVfREdREAE,"Rudest staff.. not sure even qualify for serving  food and beverages..  msg to owner/s dont go hire cheap labour, it will rune your reputation"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODhmQ1hBEAE,The stairs nearly killed me but the ambience was worth the climb.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoenB6bHVBRRAB,Love this hidden gem. The booths (or carriages as they call them) are quite unique and I highly recommend you book one as the service is outstanding. Push the call button and almost instant service. The food is from Cookie modern Thai downstairs and drinks as usual. Great place for a date or to take a client like I did. Impressive!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGJpMkJREAE,"While this was a great place for an intimate concert, the room was overfilled and under ventilated to the point people were passing out during the show. A dangerous way to run a venue."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3VUdEFnEAE,"If you're looking for a night out in a vibrant atmosphere, The Toff nightclub is definitely worth checking out. The atmosphere of the club is energetic and lively, creating a perfect setting for a night of dancing and socializing.  While the DJ may not have been the highlight of the night, the bar service was top-notch. The bartenders were attentive and quick to serve, making sure that everyone had a good time. Overall, I had a great experience at The Toff nightclub and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHItbTZ3RRAB,"Lobster soup was good, but service is slow, i dont blame it because is only one staff working."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEtEVmpRRRAB,Good food and good service Would highly recommend the cheesy chicken!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDVTQzJBRRAB,Food and service was good although The menu was a little schizophrenic and on the more expensive side.  The Asahi on tap is fully imported!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczlETW9BRRAB,Seafood platter for 4(between 3) was very filling with high quality seafood. Very much enjoyed the meal! Very delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTRxZjdnRRAB,"Do not eat here or bother with this place! Terrible customer service. Rude staff. We had a small box of food from the food court which we walked in with and didn‚Äôt seem to be an issue when we initially were seated. Male staff member came up to us with an attitude and stated that we could not be seated in the restaurant with a small box of food we had been carrying. Then when we advised the lady who seated us didn‚Äôt say anything about it, he called over the lady who then approached us with more of an attitude about the box of food which was only a cheese on a stick. After the rude encounter we advised that we would be leaving the store, the staff were happy to let an order of lobsters, oysters and fresh seafood go over a left over box of cheese on a stick."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaTRQdnN3RRAB,"Delicious, fast, friendly staff üòä"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLU1xTU5nEAE,"If you have young children with a half drank bubble tea or similar already in their hands. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this place unless you are ok for them to throw or take your kids unsealed drink away to pop in their fridge. Despite we said will leave the drink to the side of our table, with the paper straw taken out and place it on top of the cup. They still insisted that my 5yo drink need to be removed from the table. Being a restaurant, who knows what sort of raw food they have in their fridge out the back. The first staff was understanding, however the so called manager then came out with an attitude, so we left. Went to Au79 Cafe also in Emporium instead and had no issue, even though they also have the no food and drink from outside rule. At least some common sense there, as it was obvious the drink is to keep a child quiet so that the adults can have a meal. We have been here a few times, and thought the food was ok but with what we‚Äôve experienced yesterday, it‚Äôs safe to say that it will be our last."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdHZ6UG5BRRAB,Food was really bad. Too much staple food but no enough vegetables and meat. Not worth the price. Not recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbXNucnhnRRAB,Really nice place! Food was super quick and delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOThDa0ZnEAE,"I can say food taste is ok but the way they served is poor,, the bowl of fried rice has crack, the sizzling pork was not even hot plate, the poor sliced cabbage garnish of gyoza was not appealing and the Lychee martini-cocktail has a taste like expired fruits, but I‚Äôm sure they can improve more"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCa2FtdExBEAE,Very overpriced average food. Can‚Äôt even get the chips right üëé Go to pinchy‚Äôs instead ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNnN1VzZBRRAB,Good night out with kids and grannies.  Plenty of options for everyone.  Stonegrill porthouse is tender.  Lotus chips is crisp and fresh.  Clam chower soup is flavourable.  Lobster roll is so so. Good selection of drinks.  Price is reasonable. Staff is attentive and friendly.  Location is perfect with heaps of shopping in Emporium  and Fortress vedio arcade on the basement.  Will go again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdG96bERnEAE,Fresh seafood.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdXJxa0tREAE,One of our favourite restaurant
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM1AzMUlBEAE,Overpriced and average at best food.   Very disappointing to be honest.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCek5XSEpREAE,"Nice place for dining, great food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteDdmQ1J3EAE,"Fresh honest food, clean, lovely service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdy1tS193RRAB,"Reasonably priced Japanese restaurant. Ramen was not bad, can taste the lobster base in it. Drinks were pretty cheap."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtb2ExVxAB,"Very lovely Japanese style diner, love it and love the menu! Love the lobster roll!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtME5TWjhnRRAB,Very good! ! ! come back next time! ! !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtME5UZHp3RRAB,"It‚Äôs very delicious, I will be back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtME5TeGtRRRAB,Nice and wonderful experience. Will come again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDlMWEJBEAE,Good Taste I prefer this Pho than An restaurant in Sydney
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjlPTlR3EAE,You should separate the law beef with the soup when customer order take away. All the beef become well done. Terrible experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWVLY1BBEAE,"Good serving portion and delicious. I got the Liven deal for $20 which gave me a further $20 credit. Ended up with a $40. Got 2 pho for $15 each and a 6 prawn spring rolls for $10 üòÅ even though it is located at the Emporium food court, it is worth the money for a hearty delicious meals. ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXE2el93RRAB,"I'm a big fan of I love Pho but how can you serve Pho to eat in, in a takeaway container? It ruins the experience completely. This is why I only go to the Richmond store and elsewhere in the CBD for pho."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajlMTDFnRRAB,The Pho was ok but the cutlery was too small. Small spoon and flat fork and not so easy to pick up the pho.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMnJDdlpBEAE,Great place for pho
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLUwyaV9nRRAB,Good pho for food court
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcnFfc0F3EAE,Noodles was overcooked. Broth was good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNWJTMHZRRRAB,"Ordered takeaway pho with beef soup, slice ans tendons. I'm surprised to find raw meat in my bowl, and of course the soup is not hot boiling anymore after i reached home. So i had to tuen on the stove and cook, which contradicts the point of ordering takeaway. Also the mint leaves aren't fresh, I had to pick out the brown leaves.. taste of the soup itself is nothing special. not recommended menus is as of 1 Dec 2022"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaDhLSk5REAE,"Order beef noodles, add vegetables and pho. $17 It's extremely unpalatable, it's not that it's unpalatable, it's unpalatable. The soup tasted very light. The pho is really bad, I don't know why it is so tasteless. I like Vietnamese noodles very much. I have eaten almost every one in the city. This is really the first time I have eaten it. It is really unpalatable. I can‚Äôt complain. It's really worse than the mekong pho on Swanston st."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtci11UVhBEAE,A treat...delicious pho and nice service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMTgzR2Z3EAE,Dies what it says on the sign and well. Tastes hearty pho in a hurry. Thanks
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcGJDTFd3EAE,Delicious salads and soups
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleGIzZTZRRRAB,"Excellent broth and very reasonable lunch. Conveniently located, swift service and hearty food. Seems to serve a lot of single ladies eating by themselves."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOW8zZGd3RRAB,"Great friendly staff, Pho is not bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMU1fajdRRRAB,"Prefer this to its mothership in Richmond, much nicer n cleaner seating area, food just as good if not better. This together with other food stalls make Emporium our first choice for lunch in CBD."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlajVtbmlnRRAB,Beef pho pleasant soup taste. Needs a bit more meat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cEttNzVRRRAB,It was ok.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb3Qzc09BEAE,Dumpling prawn egg noodle soup.üëå ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydjlpVmNnEAE,The orders take awhile since there's there's only 2 guys who does the preparations but the food was okay..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXODQ2R05REAE,It was delicious and the soup was authentic. It's real Vietnamese food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbWZUSzN3RRAB,Really amazing vegan pho üç≤ fresh and tasty! Staff very friendly and accomodating to dietary needs! Spring rolls tasted very fresh and piping hot. ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bU5lN0x3EAE,Great sushi train on level 4 of emporium. Excellent ordering system for when they‚Äôre busy. Cleaner and better quality food than most sushi trains
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUxEYmZ3EAE,"Not taste good. I ate here five years ago which was super good. But not this time, I am displeased with this restaurant, even no water service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjhHeTFBRRAB,"My partner and I have been dining in this place numerous times since 2019, it was our ‚Äúgo-to bbq place‚Äù coz we used to love their wagyu meat (especially the chef‚Äôs selection), UP UNTIL TODAY. We dined-in for lunch with our usual order of Chef‚Äôs selection, and the karubi wagyu M9+ slices were unfortunately almost pure fat, it was sickening to chew and swallow after grilling.. just fatty disgusting.‚òπÔ∏è. See comparison of the karubi M9+ on both photos (previous karubi vs today‚Äôs karubi). Plus the waitress explanation was complete wrong, it was too painful to listen to her, and wouldn‚Äôt want to replace the meat. We‚Äôre hoping they‚Äôll do it right the next time, or we might sadly cross off this place in our list of fave places in Melbourne."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczdyRGJ3EAE,"Had a wonderful time here at Tetsujin. We did the Japanese BBQ option, we was absolutely fantastic, super tasty and fun to cook ourselves! We didn't book a table only walked in, the staff helped with giving us a table although we had a time limit as the table had a booking an hour later, that was fine we had plenty of time to cook and eat. One con I had was I found it hard to get staff attention so I could get another drink but the a very small gripe as everyone was friendly and the food was great!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZy1YWk1BEAE,Definitely the best sukiyaki that I ever had in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5OE5MVnJRRRAB,Place has gone down hill from what it used to be. Sushi is worse quality and price has increaced dramatically. Better off going to sushi hub for better quality.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMlp1dVRnEAE,I really don't understand what the buzz is about. Standard sushi train. Rice is good quality. Had better sushi train in Brissie. Nothing to write home about. Maybe the BBQ is good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLXBxTlBREAE,"Used to be great, now quite ordinary. Kind of like Ricky Gervais"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnNMa3lRRRAB,Food is ok. Service is slow. Always busy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHJlbThRRRAB,It literally has a disco bathroom Automatic 5 stars
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbU9ibTZ3RRAB,The food was some of the best I have ever had.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzYtU1J3EAE,"I have eaten here many, many times but recently there has been a significant change. Prices have risen quite significantly, which is understandable in these times, however most disappointing is the fall in quality of the food.  Everything from the freshness of the seafood to the flavour and texture of vegetables including avocado (a children‚Äôs favourite) is demonstrably poorer. What has happened? Is there new management? Have they lost key staff?  It is no longer my go-to for sushi and I miss what they once were."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjRxRnZnRRAB,"Reasonably priced sushi train, although not amazing, was not bad either."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSai12bW5nRRAB,"Great food and service. The restaurant and amenities are a little outdated, but the Wagyu was delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbV9iRlB3EAE,Popular & very buzzy sushi train. Especially liked the mini okomamiaki!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzlmY0tBEAE,We used to visit this restaurant for the sushi train frequently. The prices have increased substantially to a minimum of $4.20 to around $9 per plate now. Additionally not many of the plates are at the $4.20 mark and more around $5-$6.  The quality of the sushi/sashimi has also deteriorated as it appears the same food sits on the conveyor all day if not taken by a customer.  Would prefer to to go Sushi Hotaru given the high pricing and mediocre food at Tetsujin.  The bbq is also better at other restaurants places such as Bornga on Little Bourke St in Chinatown.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnBib0dBEAE,"Food is good, disco lights in the toilets are annoying"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbE5qNlFnEAE,"Low quality sushi, made my friend and I ultra sick :(("
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEs3ZFV3EAE,My family went today to celebrate my dad birthday. We were all very satisfied with the food quality being fresh and came out in fast  pace. Great service from friendly staffs.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNEpIN3lBRRAB,Very nice meats
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMC1HdmF3EAE,The store was clean and the sushi was fresh. We visited after lunch rush hours so service was a bit slow.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mkl6d2FREAE,Surprised to have to ask for sugar for a cup of tea and then doubly surprised she emptied the individual sachets into a small empty cup. Egg cups a brilliant idea. Loved it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTcyd0NBEAE,Absolutely delicious food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmFIQ0tBEAE,Having been here years ago and comparing with how the pork belly sandwich is now. It was flavourless and oily. 16 bucks could've went to a banh mi for 10
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXU2WnNRRRAB,Very bad customer service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXBUVUZnEAE,"The guy that served me was extremely rude. Gave me this look as if I wasted his precious time, while the only thing I did was choosing a yogurt from the fridge and going to the counter to pay! The person did not greet or say any word, just grabbed the item I was buying and said ‚Äúthere‚Äù to the eftpos machines. I actually felt humiliated, have NEVER encountered such appalling service like that before! Will never come here again!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoelpmdFVnEAE,Good healthy food. I really enjoyed the little edamame hummus salad.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOE9YVG53RRAB,"Simple and healthy everyday eats made from locally sourced produce. Their range features breakfast, sandwiches, warm salads and, of course, coffee.  I had the ü•™üêî Classic Chicken Sandwich for $10.5. A bit pricey for the size you get, but you can definitely taste the quality. Free-range chicken, dill, parsley, house mayo, and rocket sandwiched in between two slices of 7 grain sourdough.  I also had the ü•ó salad bowl with a base of steamed üåæ brown rice, peas, lentils with warm hummus topped with üêî poached chicken. It tasted so clean and healthy, perfect for those who're trying to eat clean but don't have time to cook.  Lastly, I had the Housemade Overnight Oats with Fresh üçìStrawberry (or you can choose poached üçé apple instead) for $8.5. Taste was nice, but size was quite small for what you pay."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURld2F5UlFREAE,"I stayed in Melbourne for 2 weeks earlier this year and loved this place for their New York Corned Beef Sandwich, cookies and banana bread!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnBmWThBRRAB,"Order the Melbournes favorite since 2010, The Pork Belly. Looked kind of healthy and a little dry. The Pork was a little dry and the crispy skin was more hard than crispy. The coleslaw gave the illusion that it was a healthy meal, which it was on a way."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c1l2YTlnRRAB,had the egg pot and it was a win. The hot chocolate was the worst I have ever had.  Happy friendly staff and clean tables.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MEpyQ3hRRRAB,staff very helpful
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaC1qeVd3EAE,The service! Multitasking amazing job üëè  and great take away food Thankyou ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdnNUNmx3RRAB,Food tasted really average and came a bit cold.  The coffee was below par.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMjU3WWh3RRAB,Will never eat here again. Had yogurt from their fridge selection this morning and got food poisoning ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ Also the falafels are so dry. Lost a loyal customer. ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdmEyVnhRRRAB,"We were in search of somewhere indoors for a late afternoon coffe - when we came across this cafe still open in the Emporium shopping precinct. I ordered a hot chocolate and there was no taste of chocolate only warm milk and looked like it only had chocolate sprinkled on top. Unfortunately for the lady I was with, her coffee was very weak and same very disappointed. Maybe the teas are better"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdF9xY0xnEAE,Delicious healthy options with lots of variety. Good mix of sweet and savoury items and drink options. My salad was so nice! Thanks.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXczVDTWpBRRAB,No quality standards. The milk was burnt and the coffee tasted aweful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdHEybFNnEAE,Love this place when l go to the CBD this is where l get my coffee pick me up  The best chic chip cookies ever and best sandwiches and cold drinks too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM195NzVBRRAB,Lauren so good      consistent great coffee every single time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX2V5LW1nRRAB,"OMG! Had the egg pot with hash bites and bacon.... and it was the best eggs I have had in forever! Comes in a cute little takeaway pot and was absolutely delicious, it didn't need anything. The little toast soldiers where super cute and tasty. Friendly service as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNGNTLXh3RRAB,Had the egg and bacon roll on turkish bread slight toasted with relish sauce. Was yummo! Would definitely go back! Highly recommend. Service was excellent!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MU42U1hnEAE,Disappointing service here.  Picked out my food but it seems none of the 3 of 4 staff available could be bothered serving me.  (The 4th staff at member was making coffee & actually tried to let the other 3 know I was waiting but ........).  I waited for a couple of minutes & then left to buy my lunch elsewhere. Would not recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzajRDV3BnRRAB,That mushroom egg pot is üî• ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNF9HQjdBRRAB,Interesting!! Good place to have breakfast and chat with your friend. It was calm and pleasant though in midst of a shopping center.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bExTZmR3EAE,"Just come sit, order your food, eat and leave kind of place with plenty of MSG"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0lMekJnEAE,Felt Awesome being having authentic Vietnamse Dishes...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b1BMOU1BEAE,Need to waiting far too long.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbl9ENWN3EAE,Disgusting hygeine. Dont visit here if you care about hygeine. Ordered beef combination pho. Threr was a hair in the soup and sent it back. No apology from the girl and she brought anthother bowl in a minute. Then there was an eyelash stuck in the meat... Literally the most disgusting experience ever. I visited this place on 05/05/2023 around at 11 am and the shop wasn't even busy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN183YlBBEAE,Authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Highly recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScjVtYktnEAE,"You deserve better!  I recently visited this Vietnamese restaurant, drawn in by the long lines and Bill Clinton's supposed endorsement. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the food is good, it didn't seem worth this price or the 20-minute wait in line, considering the price, I believe there are a lot of other options available.  The rice rolls and spring rolls were average, and my noodle soup was disappointing - a far cry from the pho I'm used to. Additionally, the staff was impatient and borderline rude, making for an unpleasant dining experience. While some people may enjoy this restaurant, I personally wouldn't recommend it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDZpUFF3EAE,good food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjREbHVBRRAB,The best pho in Melbourne ever
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTRIZDJRRRAB,As far as pho goes this place isn‚Äôt good at all. The roll was also dried and tasteless.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjY3WkNREAE,Tasty Beef Pho. they also have char grilled chicken pho which is very tasty with smokey taste from the char grilling and a nice switchup from the usual order of the great beef pho
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOF9MM1NnEAE,Best Vietnamese noodles in Melbourne!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWRUMEhnEAE,"The ""chargrilled"" chicken is the strangest chargrilled meat I've ever experienced. It's a slab of meat that didn't even look like chicken.  It was soft and kind of sweet so it didn't seem chargrilled.  I'm sure the pho must be fine but this dish was a disappointment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMVAzNHV3RRAB,"Located in the bustling heart of Melbourne's CBD, this long-standing Vietnamese restaurant has been warming the hearts and bellies of both locals and tourists for years. Steeped in history and adorned with photographs of Asian celebrities who have graced its tables, it's no wonder this storied establishment has become a veritable institution in the city's culinary scene.  I ventured into this renowned eatery with great anticipation. True to its reputation, I was promptly presented with a steaming bowl of their signature pho noodle soup. The broth was fragrant, rich, and soothing - the perfect antidote to Melbourne's chilly winters. At $15.50 for a small bowl (May 2023), the price may seem steep, but the experience and ambience are worth the premium.  Beyond the pho, the restaurant offers a delightful selection of Vietnamese staples, including their generously-portioned spring rolls. At $19.50 for eight pieces, they may appear to be on the pricey side, but these delectable morsels are larger than your average spring roll, justifying the cost. Their size and satisfying crunch make them a worthy accompaniment to the meal.  However, for those seeking a more authentic and adventurous dining experience, it's worth noting that Melbourne's sprawling suburbs offer an array of hidden gems. If you're able to venture out to the Springvale area, you'll find a treasure trove of establishments serving up even more delectable pho dishes, bursting with flavor and authenticity.  In conclusion, this iconic restaurant in Melbourne's CBD is an ideal stop for tourists looking for a comforting, warm meal amidst the city's vibrant streets. With its rich history and notable clientele, it's a must-visit for those who appreciate both the culinary and cultural aspects of dining. But for pho connoisseurs seeking the ultimate bowl, a trip to the city's outskirts may prove to be an even more rewarding adventure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWJHdWd3RRAB,Lovely place and atmosphere. Tried the beef slice pho and was rather satisfied with it! Had some generous portions (at least according to Indonesian standards) and quite tasty as well. They also have free refillable hot tea.  Recommended to visit if you're looking for a tasty pho in the middle of town. Think the dishes would be lovely as wcomfort food food. Would visit again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa1piY3hnRRAB,"Erwang, I really like the soup, it's fresh and sweet The next time I come to Melbourne, I will still come to the store again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZ5SU13EAE,Chicken Specials and 'VB' - ace!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXBTQWR3EAE,I always saw there is a food line there! After I had a meal I would say it was worth how long I was waiting! Deliciousssssss food and great customer service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXBxLWtnRRAB,"Went in with partner as recommended by a friend, however we were a bit disappointed by the food quality. The broth of ph·ªü d·∫∑c bi·ªát was disproportionally sweet, and lacked the aroma and umami one would expect from a good bowl of ph·ªü. The chicken in c∆°m t·∫•m g√† n∆∞·ªõng was more teriyaki than chargrilled. Overall: bland, sweet, not for someone after authentic Vietnamese food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3QyWTlnRRAB,"I always see a lot of people dining here, so I also come to eat once. The taste is good, if you want to try the Vietnamese flavor, you can check it out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkt2a2NREAE,Wonderful bunh mi
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbU1HRkpREAE,"Pho: 8/10 (16aud) Chicken broken rice: 7.8/10 (15aud)  If you want to try Northern Pho this is a must. It do not has that heavy tast from the broth, it‚Äôs more light and pure and the meat is soft and all of the flavor blend well. It would be quite plain if you like or get used to Southern Vietnam Pho. The Rice is quite good tho, but I would prefer more lemongrass flavour so it would taste more smoky and got that rich flavour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkptOHdnRRAB,"Tried the sukiyaki bowl and the matcha lava cake. Both were excellent! Highly recommend, will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dks2bTd3RRAB,"really nice dessert stop in the cbd at calia! made a booking in advance (do this!!! they were full to the brim) and was seated in a nice booth immediately by friendly staff! ordering is by QR on your phone which made it easy. matcha choc lave cake was a delight! quite rich and decadent. matcha tiramisu was a lighter option, also yummy with the coffee flavour. generally, the desserts werent super strong on the matcha side but enjoyable nonetheless! will return to try some savoury food and that hojicha cheesecake! thanks calia! oh and the $40 deposit came in handy at the end of the night when our bill came ot exactly $40 and we didnt have to pay at all! woo!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEpUUjlRRRAB,Delicious curry chicken and nice ambience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSal9Yd2pBRRAB,"Great food, service and environment. Make sure you check out the cute shop downstairs.  I loved my matcha latte that the lady made a cat face."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamFXTHBRRRAB,It is located in a good shopping centre but it gave me a bad experience. Unprofessional and poor service. The food presented is different from advertised from social media and takes a long time to make. Please consider when you want to experience here if you don't want to lose the joy of a day
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamE3RjZRRRAB,Highly recommend the wagyu beef
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWNhSFlBEAE,"Plus side: great atmosphere, beautiful and interesting cafe/shop. I love the shop's collection and design. So so cute.  Not so plus: food was average, and quite pricey (probably expected for a place like this)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2NMazh3RRAB,"We finally visited Calia‚Äôs beautiful Emporium branch on 21 April and we got:  üç£ Sashimi Plate 8pcs Fresh and nicely cut assortment of seafood - scallops, tuna, king fish and salmon. Perfect dish to start the meal!  üçµ Unagi Chazuke Grilled eel served with dashi tea broth. I always love this type of dish especially in winter time! The unagi was spot-on and the broth was good but a tad too subtle. I just wish there was a flavor that‚Äôs stands out from the broth.  ü•© Ultimate Bowl Uni, wagyu, french foie gras, ikura and 63 egg. This bowl is sooo fancy and full of flavors! Very creamy from the foie gras and poached egg. Although quite one dimensional, but we understood the ingredients are meant to shine here.  Overall, the place was definitely stunning and service was efficient. We‚Äôve always enjoyed our experience in Calia! Don‚Äôt forget to check out their store downstairs to get some cute stuff for your home üòâ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3RmVmV3EAE,Relaxed and comfortable meeting place for business with polite service and tasty modern Asian dishes
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanUtMTZ3RRAB,Love the food!!! It‚Äôs delicious!! But the staff at the entrance was very grumpy üòí
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXNTWk5REAE,"Calia is as solid as always and thankfully the new outfit means that there's far more space available than at their previous restaurant.  I always describe Calia as simple food done well. We had the unagi and kinoki bowls. The kinoki remains one of my favourites as it's so well balanced. You have buttery mushrooms with sweet rice, creamy tofu, sour plum, and crispy shitake. It's intensely savoury but still bright."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMm9IWUlREAE,"Perfect place, good food, but it took a while for the food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb29fTTB3RRAB,"It wasnt busy at all in the venue. However, sukiyaki bowl took more than 20mins to come out, also the dish was cold served, the beef was squishy and salty! Not worth the price and hype! Never going back there again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3YtZ3Z3RRAB,Really over priced for what you get. Service is disinterested. Been there twice and both times came away disappointed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSak15SHlBRRAB,"Food is quite nice but the new booking system which requires a $40 deposit needs some work. On arrival, the hostess is trained to let you know that the deposit will be refunded at the counter. However, purchase is via the QR code app where the pay at the counter option is ""cash only"". Therefore, if you only have card and need to get your deposit refund, you will most likely select the credit card option. However, once you do this, you can't get your deposit back. You have to then email head office and try to get your deposit back which is a real screw around. Really unhappy with this and hope to get it back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScE9PdEtREAE,"This used to be my safe go to for lunch or dinner in the city. Food is slightly above average in quality and the price matches it. I have repeatedly ordered curry chicken bowl, sukiyaki bowl, salmon bowl and chirashi bowl and they have been consistent. Tonight I decided to add something different and got the wagyu tataki but it was a massive disappointment. It was ice cold, extremely thinly sliced with NO sear on the edges and tasted of nothing but salt pepper and vinegar. It felt like it was sitting in the fridge for a long time and the fact that I received it 1 minute after placing the order confirms it was not made to order. For $17.90, it was a massive let down. Please fix this!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzRuX0FREAE,Great food great vibe
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNjlxVFp3EAE,"The food and drinks were good but our dining experience was very disappointing. Not even a hello at entrance, then all the staffs seems annoyed at us and unfriendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEk2UlR3EAE,"Felt welcomed, two people spent $72 for this, highly recommend chips, they are the best."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNy0yRlhnEAE,"ü•¢ rice don and more! üè†: @caliacollective üìç: Emporium, CBD  üìù: Today‚Äôs lunch at Calia was an absolute delight! From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance was impressive with its modern and stylish decor.  ‚ù§Ô∏è: We decided to try the üç£ sashimi platter, which was a medley of fresh and succulent slices of salmon, tuna, and kingfish - it was so beautifully presented that we almost didn't want to dig in! We also couldn't resist ordering their famous üá¶üá∫ü•© Australian Wagyu beef rice bowl, which was a heavenly combination of juicy, tender beef served over perfectly cooked rice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScS1hc2x3RRAB,Had been there several times for their crispy roast pork bowl which was my favourite. However it was so awful yesterday that I had to return and cancel it. The pork was almost all fat. Worst still the fat was not even rendered.  It was impossible to eat. It appeared that Calia has lowered their standard considerably while increasing their price consistently.  I should have invited the chef to eat it. Pretty bad and disappointed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemM3RVRREAE,Affordable good quality food and fast service.

The manager was very welcoming and the other staff were very kind. As for the food, I ordered a plate of Pineapple Fried Rice with Seafood Êµ∑ÈÆÆËè†Ëòø ÁÇíÈ£Ø ($16.97) which was delicious! Prawns, and 2 other types of fish with the pineapple elevated the food and the experience. Neat and clean with good food, I highly recommend this restaurant!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSal9HU0FnEAE,"A reasonable cheap eats location if you‚Äôre into noodle soups, rice dishes and dumplings.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodlAtcV9BRRAB,"Came here because we bought liven credits for this place but it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs not worth full price. It‚Äôs pretty busy but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre reasonably priced considering all the expensive restaurants in Chinatown. We ordered their Shanghai soup dumpling, pork and cabbage dumplings, fried noodle Indonesian style and red bean pastry. Their dumplings taste exactly like the frozen ones you got from Asian supermarket. Their soup dumplings were bland and tiny. Fried noodle was the only dish we enjoyed. The red bean pastry was super dry and hard to chew. Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for cheap eats and not fussy about quality of Chinese food, feel free. For picky eaters, save your money and go somewhere else. Oh and also, they charge $1 for a tiniest amount of chilli oil‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNUlhWkJREAE,"First off -  this place has moved fro the Tivoli Arcade to the KMart Arcade across the other side of Bourke St. Second -  great bahn me.  Tasty, freshly made as you wait and beautifully seasoned.  Terrific"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcFBMUnF3RRAB,Good spot. Fresh and quick- great if you are in a rush!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaVBmd1N3EAE,"A half day‚Äôs work needs a banh mi roll, and the best banh mi is VB."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc0p2R193RRAB,"Came for grabbing a quick bite with my partner. We bought a totally toasted banh mi which had a mix of roasted pork and duck(this mix was absolutely lovely) , cucumber, pickled carrots, and sauce (not overpowering). Overall the food was great and the service by the two lovely ladies as well. This place is worth trying if you want a quick bite. The totally roasted banh mi was around 9$."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa2Z1V2pBRRAB,The uncle on Sunday is very friendly. Banh mi + ice coffee are both affordable and delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXJxOGJREAE,The staff is nice. Food is not bad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb0pxLWRnEAE,Horrible.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMDlyNUxnEAE,Delicious banh mi
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdUozcVBREAE,Enjoyed the chick-a-dee banh mi and the what's cracklin banh mi. Vietnamese iced coffee was sweet and tasty and good value.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLTZ1dHVBRRAB,I never write reviews but this place is absolutely amazing honestly don't see myself going anywhere else
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOHB1X0tREAE,Love this place! They have moved from Tivoli Arcade to 222 Bourke Street at the Kmart Centre- hasn't been updated in Google yet it seems. Had lunch here for the first time today and it was fantastic. It's also very reasonably priced - cost my $11 for a grilled chicken salad bowl and rice paper roll! Will definitely be back :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aVAtNHVnRRAB,Great food as always
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0luSmpnRRAB,Good vegan food options available there. Fried stir fried noodles and they were so gooodddddddd.... try to add chilli as well
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEpTZUZ3EAE,I have loved this place since I first visited in 2017. It offers vegan Chinese cuisine that it bound to impress even your most die hard carnivore friends! Some of my favourite dishes are their Kung Bao Vegetarian Chicken and their Hot and Sour Soup! Delicious!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmNHdU1nEAE,This is a really really good restaurant
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSclpuUWVBEAE,Best vegetarian dumplings in Melbourne! Really friendly staff and delicious food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGVqOVhREAE,We went there on a Wednesday evening! You take the lift upstairs to the restaurant. It was a crowded tight space but once you get to your booth it's lovely. We had a seat near the windows yay! All the food is vegan so you can order whatever you like it's all lovely. We had a great time out. So fun.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2JXVDJRRRAB,"This vegetarian restaurant is really delicious üòã, in downtown Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3R6RXlRRRAB,"Good vegetarian food, wide range of dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaklmR3hnRRAB,"Don‚Äôt understand what all the hype is about. The food was atrocious and so overpriced. Paid over $70 for microwaved food and canned vegetables mixed together with bland sauce. Could only manage to eat a few mouthfuls before being overwhelmingly put off by the food quality.  I was still made to pay for the entire meal, even after expressing complaints. Will never return. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaktYZU9nEAE,"Food was cold, putrid and over priced. A real shame. If you want to experience what vegan food would be like on a Chinese airline then eat here. Personally I will be steering everyone I know away from this joint. Never again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc1B1LV9RRRAB,"Extremely disappointed in the service we ""recieved"" last weekend. We made a booking early that morning and we arrived 5 minutes early. We waited for our table and within 10 minutes the 4 of us were seated in a booth. But that was short lived as 20 minutes later, thinking they were coming to take our order, we instead were asked to move to allow a larger group to sit in the booth..... ? ... ok... No worries, we understand you want to cater for groups so we happily moved. Still ready and waiting to order now at our new table, we had to get the attention of staff as no one was serving us. Once we got the waitress attention, ordering seemed promising as she knew the item numbers by code and our drinks came out fairly prompt. We were then given 3 bowls for the 4 of us and told another was coming as we sat patiently awaiting out food. Not only did the 4th bowl not arrive, but as we watched new people be seated around us, it became more and more packed. We waited, waited... the new people were all being served before us, we even saw meals we had ordered, be served to those who had been seated 30 minutes after we had been! What was going on? We went to ask someone and were told someone would check. We never heard back and an hour passed with no food and no communication. Ridiculous! We had to leave hungry to get to our show and the waitress had the nerve to ask us to pay for drinks, 2 of which weren't even opened as we were waiting to have them with our non existent meals!! This place cannot handle the number of people they took on that night and no matter how patient or polite you are, trying to get any help or attention is pointless."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcHJTMlNREAE,"Beautiful all-vegan restaurant. Their lychee soda was delicious and the sweet and sour 'pork' was to die for.  I don't recommend coming here on a busy night. I came here again because I was so impressed the first time, but the service was terrible on my second visit. We had a 6:30 reservation but we were told to wait for a table... it took them half-an-hour to get a table ready. When the food came out, we were not given plates or cutlery and we had to ask for these items from the waiter. If this had been my first visit, I would not have been impressed. Honestly not super keen for a third visit. üòê"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScEpIUmlBRRAB,"So bad, my man"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNlBUQjZBRRAB,"Sweet and sour pork - super flavorful, and I love the meat texture! Their pea sprout is also worth mentioning - hearty, light and comforting at the same time. Fried rice with moss - wish it could be a tad saltier. But overall.. I like everything I ordered!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna3FhNFZ3EAE,Sanctified vegan food :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNzRESlNREAE,Top notch tofu veggie fried rice with chilli
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeC1MWVF3EAE,"We went there on friday for lunch. They were quite busy and only one waitstaff was working. However, they still had an excellent and quick service. We have ordered pancakes, dumplings, and noodles. We absolutely loved the noodles 10/10. Dumplings and pancakes were alright. Will recommend this place to everyone üëå"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDdXNGNBEAE,"One of the best around, love the food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURody1TYWlnRRAB,Fabulous veg food with lots of choice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeFltQk5nEAE,Beautiful food and huge menu.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGVMbWFnEAE,The food was really yum and tasty. A must try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN191UHBBRRAB,The staff were very friendly and made the dinner enjoyable. The food was good and they provided a takeaway box for the leftovers as the portions were quite large. Overall a good experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTdmMUJnEAE,They don‚Äôt wash there cups
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdGJDZnlBRRAB,"The dishes are very good, the portions are generous, and the service is very friendly, especially the proprietress. The overall friend gathering atmosphere is very goodüëç"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGZlcjdnRRAB,"They forgot about our mains, so we left hungry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3Q3bVVBEAE,"Went because we were looking for Claypot Rice, and believed that this was an option here. Unfortunately, we were sorely dissapointed, and the scallion pancakes and dumplings we also got were dissapointing to say the least"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDhiZUNREAE,"Very poor quality food, the portions were small and unfriendly service. Not recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2I2WEV3EAE,"Awesome food but bad customer service, entree came so late entire rest of the meal was finished, had to ask four times to get it to come, despite it being so late the restaurant took entree back rather than offer it for free, no apology for delay from the manager"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGNEdVZREAE,Flavorful food... But obviously oily most probably coz of the type of cuisine. Always give a stuffed feeling after...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ1pDb2hBRRAB,Good and well priced food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHJxQTdRRRAB,"Don‚Äôt come here when it‚Äôs busy, 40 mins still noting"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEw3b0t3EAE,Small dishes and overpriced
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjZ1ZE13EAE,"Good food, reasonable prices."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoemZueThBRRAB,Great food. Found the ordering tablets a bit challenging but the staff were eager to help.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWRiNHlnRRAB,"Perfect for late night food. Came with a group at 10.30pm Friday and ordered a bunch of food before last orders. Food was really good! Highly rate the pork green beans, chilli chicken peanut dish, and dumplings. Ample seating. Slightly more pricy compared to other places in China town. Would definitely come again at the end of a night out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodk4tRHdBRRAB,BE AWARE OF THE PRICE THEY ADVERTISING WAS MISLEADING CUSTOMERS
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNS1DSkVBEAE,"Whenever we are in the city, we make time for The Crane. Food is always top quality and the service is fast and friendly.  Love the seafood hotpot and Mongolian sizzling steak. Outstanding  :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeTdxdW13RRAB,Food tasted alright but wait was long and when it came out half of the food was chilli
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM2NiLXJnRRAB,"Food was good, came as a group and we got a variety of dumplings to share as a group."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eEtXVXdRRRAB,"I was looking for a hot dessert and saw they had black rice pudding with coconut cream and mango, just up my alley!  But it was freezing cold, not up my alley üòû, especially on a cold evening so my bad.  The rice was okay but the mango was something that tasted like it came from a tin because it chopped small and the syrup was too sweet.  I nicely asked if I could have a bit more coconut cream (to offset the mango), there was lots of two-ing and fro-ing about their answer between staff (very young ladies run this place) so they decided I needed to pay more.  Not a great first impression I'm afraidü§î. Then they changed their mind, and gave it to me anyway, damage done sorry.  I ate the cream but couldn't finish my dessert üòî apart from this, it's a popular hang out for young peeps."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEtQeGZ3EAE,Best place for desserts
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEl5NEZnEAE,"ORDERED: üç®‚Ää 61. Milk Snow Ice with Mango Jelly and Mango Juice with Popping Pearl üç®‚Ää 64. Milk Snow Ice with Red Bean, Pearl and Mango Pudding  These were $32.76 together!  REVIEW: Dessert story is an iconic institution in Melbourne. It's been around forever and its efficiency has never stopped. Bare bones, Dessert story will give you dessert and space with friends but nothing more.  The menu hasn't really changed over the years. The Milk Snow with Ice with mango jelly is still the best! It is lacking the additional flavour and wow factor that you get from its competitors in the Korean shaved ice space. But as a result of the lack of pizzazz, the desserts themselves are very affordable for the quantity.  Definitely more of a cheap spot for kick ons after dinner. The tables are cramped, and the plastic spoons and cutlery don't provide much focus on quality. There's no real table service, so you'll need to order at the counter and then they'll bring you the food to your little table number stand. The food comes out unbelievably fast too. Efficiency number 1."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b04zRmFBEAE,Good portion and tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNmV6RlpBEAE,Good portion size for sharing. Staff were really friendly and the waiting time isn‚Äôt very long at night.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc2U2bVFBEAE,"Okay so this looks to be a marmite little joint, you either love it or loathe it. We might have been lucky tonight as all stars aligned, hence a 5* review. This place is fab for a late-ish night grub (say around 11pm, when most other venues are already shut). We've started with desserts, which were prima sort - really great HK style. Had #27, 41 and 83, all brill. Then the savory bites: ok maybe not the best in class, but certainly did the trick that night and hey, it's a Dessert story and not noodles or ramen or whatever. That said, hugely enjoyed the ü•öü•ö and dumplings, also no complaints about the chicken schnitzel (yes, served in a paper bag, but so what, the batter was actually very tasty). Good vibes about this place, still full of people, and staff were all smiles and quick to attend and serve food. It may depend on whose shift it is, but was really surprised to see that some folks complained about rudeness of staff. The team tonight were great üëç  All in all, really recommend for desserts or if you find yourself with an empty stomach after 10pm. Will be going back to go through some more items on the dessert menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3EzX3dnRRAB,Friendly staff & delicious dessert
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnNfbnJBRRAB,"The girl staff was super rude. She seemed new there. I have not seen her before. She was tall and had a full make up and her hair was up. Never seen anyone serving customers with such angry face and telling us as if she scolding at naughty kids..She was snatching the menus, not listening, not answering..if she does not serve customers then she should never work in there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnBlellnEAE,Really good Asian dessert
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkxTVHpnRRAB,Definitely a comfort place to have some cold desserts.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUp2SGtBRRAB,"It was an amazing experience ! The snow ice dessert taste amazing and the staffs are really friendly, there‚Äôs a female staff who made my order and recommended me yo get the mango snow ice and it was so delicious. Will definitely be back and try more new dessert üòä ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEtqOFR3EAE,Didn't like the kinds of desserts much
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajltaFZ3EAE,Good taste
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajRqeW1RRRAB,Best desserts in Chinatown and the staff are amazing! A must visit if you are here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDVUamdnRRAB,Great China town dessert bar and I love that it‚Äôs open late! Lots of vegan options
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGZESnVRRRAB,Lovely dessert and hospitality
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMVlDUnhRRRAB,Delicious food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOXZuczJ3RRAB,"Worst desert I‚Äôve had in a long time, the staff didn‚Äôt want to be there, table and menus were sticky. They are open late and there is lots of seating.  It‚Äôs was around 10pm and we didn‚Äôt have a ton of options as many restaurants had closed. This place seemed good from the outside. We places are order and we‚Äôre given a number and a table. It came in 5-7 minutes.  The restaurant looks nice and has a storybook theme with library vibes. we ordered the mango shaving bowl and it was the only thing I had in Australia that tasted very artificial with cheap ingredients."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMXEyOUFREAE,Enjoyed my mango pomelo in mango juice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNk51R1dBEAE,Seriously delicious dessert offerings. I highly recommend a visit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodzVpdWZ3EAE,The signature herbal jelly is always my favourite. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Great option if you crave for something sweet at late night.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek91aFFREAE,Went to have my first charsu ramen and it was soo good! I was confused between charsu and teriyaki charsu and went with the teriyaki one with spicy tonkotsu broth. The noodles and the broth were so tasty. It was mildly flavorful and filling. I took half extra noodles which were free and made it a complete meal for me. I also tried the lychee beer which was something unique. All in all had a good lunch. Just be mindful of the way google map direct you. Enter chinatown lane and enter through the aisle next to parking. You should be able to see it then.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUtuWXJ3RRAB,One of the best ramen I ate in Melbourne.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdlktQVd3EAE,Yummy food and very friendly service :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmJHVjNRRRAB,Over the years we have eaten so much Japanese food‚Ä¶ many local and also in Japan. Mr Ramen San is so authentic and delicious. We all chose something different and none of it disappointed us. Washed down with a beer and it was so satisfying. They offer extra noodles free for those with a bigger appetite so save some of the broth and indulge in more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmFpOVlBEAE,"Mr Ramen San is a small but cozy restaurant located in Melbourne's CBD, and it's a must-visit for any ramen lover in the city. The restaurant offers a selection of authentic Japanese ramen dishes, including pork, chicken, and vegetarian options, as well as sides and appetizers. The atmosphere of Mr Ramen San is welcoming and casual, with a minimalist d√©cor that emphasizes the focus on the food. The seating is communal, with large wooden tables and benches, which can create a convivial atmosphere as diners enjoy their meals. The star of the menu at Mr Ramen San is undoubtedly the ramen, which is cooked to perfection with an excellent balance of flavours. The pork broth is rich and savoury, and the noodles are chewy and flavourful. The toppings, such as the chashu pork and the soft-boiled egg, are also outstanding and add depth and complexity to the dish. Aside from ramen, the restaurant also offers delicious sides such as gyoza and edamame, as well as a selection of Japanese drinks including sake and Japanese beer. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, happy to help diners navigate the menu and provide recommendations. Overall, Mr Ramen San is a fantastic spot for a satisfying and authentic ramen experience in Melbourne. The prices are reasonable, the portions are generous, and the food is simply delicious. It's a great option for a quick lunch or a casual dinner, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot to enjoy a hearty bowl of ramen with friends or family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamZETnRBRRAB,"My daughter and I went here yesterday for dinner. 10/10 the staff was amazing and welcoming, the Raman was the best we have ever had. And we waited maybe 3 mins to get a table. Can not recommend enough! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWZMTmhBRRAB,The ramen soup is delicious! They offered extra free noodles but the original size can feed you up well already.  Friendly staff with good customer service.  Definitely will visit here againüòá
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWE3Ui1RRRAB,Most of the Japanese staff! it's delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWZ5UEVREAE,Great selection of Japanese ramen and side dishes. The tonkotsu ramen is  rich in flavour without being too overpowering.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3A2bjNRRRAB,"Very good Charsu Ramen, with a delicious broth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdklHaE9nEAE,Delicious pork tonkatsu ramen!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNU1UOHBnRRAB,Refill noodle is worth the money just to fill up but often soggy and overcooked.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaU9hSkRnEAE,Very good ramen at a good price!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaU1UU2NnEAE,"Tonkotsu ramen was comforting. I didn't need the extra noodles, though a fellow diner did and I believe they were free."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb1BYRy1BRRAB,Great ramen
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0lYdW1nRRAB,"the ramen is not too bad, flavour is more on the mild side. gyoza tastes very good tho. friendly and kind service, very helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTRIZC1RRRAB,Could have been in Noborito
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczlISm53RRAB,"Taste: 5/5 Portions: medium Price: $-$$  The extra noodles are free if you finish them, but cost if you don‚Äôt, which is a very neat idea."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzhlTVFBEAE,"Been a loyal customer for the past 3 years. But I really don‚Äôt know what has happened to the broth. It‚Äôs so blend now, I come every time with the expectation that It has gotten better but just get disappointed. Wish they can get it back to the quality level they have always delivered."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzh2SDZRRRAB,"Atmosphere was good, fairly small place. I had the vegan ramen and it was good overall. Noodles were a bit lacklustre and the broth wasn't anything exciting. Props for having a proper vegan option, most ramen places don't..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM2Fudm93RRAB,Noodles and broth was very good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk5pQW9RRRAB,"Great quality food and their Cocktails are amazing and presented in unique glassware! A bit pricey, but you pay for the experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OU9tQ0xnEAE,So we went here for my partners 40th birthday and we wanted to go there as it‚Äôs a fun experience and took my young boys as it was a good experience and something new for them. The staff were fantastic and very hospitable and happily took a cake I brought in I can not thank them enough for accommodating us and letting us stay back. So my partner selected this place as the food is what we love about this place so we wanted our family and friends to experience this as we had talked it up for a long time. Now the food itself was fantastic. However the lack of it is what has upset us to a point that we all felt hungry still and for 2 adults and 2 kids totalling $330 we definitely should not have been feeling hungry. Happy to pay for a great meal but we shouldn‚Äôt have the need to eat on the way home. The disappointment was our friends and family also felt the same. I believe that the kids meals which we had to Change to suit the kids tastes were just deleted and not replaced with the alternative selection we had made totally understand that if it was not in the price bracket of my expectations for premium service. Feel a little bit ripoff but I hope you guys will take in the right manner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MUlpUXV3RRAB,"Great experience, tasty food and drinks or chef was friendly and entertaining!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ19ldVR3EAE,"Came with a big group. Staff were accommodating and super friendly but food was not worth the money you pay. Fried rice was dry and old, meat barley had flavour"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWJDQUlnEAE,"Disclaimer: This is a review from a VEGAN/VEGETARIAN perspective. The meat eaters we were with enjoyed their experience. HOWEVER, we did not. We understood we were going to a meat based restaurant which is totally okay, however the fact that they offer a VEG SET MENU sets the premise that they will be able to cater for VEGETARIAN. This is not the case. We called before hand and were advised that Vegan was no issue and they would be happy to cater for us fully as per the VEG SET MENU. We were charged the full fee for the veg set menu. However we barely got anything as per the menu. None of our food was prepared in front of us so we were not paying for that experience either. We were not served Yasai Salad, Spring Roll or Fried Rice (These are three dishes stated on the VEG menu). We were given four puffs of tofu in soy sauce, a tiny portion of stir fry veg, we were given a bowl of 4 pieces of tempura veg with no sauce. It was all so disappointing. As I said we understood that it was a largely meat restaurant, but in our opinion a VEG MENU should not be offered (and for that price!) because you don't cater for us. We are a young couple with a new baby and it was our first night out away from our child and we had saved for that and were really upset with the cost for what we got and no experience. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR VEGETARIANS/VEGANS"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWNYb1p3EAE,"Very professional, nice area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUlfYl9BRRAB,Amazing place to eat. Bento sets r worth every penny! Been trying to figure out where they get the peanutbutter mochi.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnREQWlRRRAB,Had the best experience here last night. Watching our chef cook and some fun games at the end. Food was delicious. Best experience ever
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLU0zWW53RRAB,"My partner and I came here for our anniversary recently and had an absolutely fantastic time. The food was cooked perfectly and contrary to the other reviews we found the amount of food/portion sizes very fair! The meat was cooked perfectly, so tender! The ‚Äúshow‚Äù and ‚Äútheatrics‚Äù were brilliant. The chef engaged with us and had us laughing out loud. Table service was great, the dirty plates were gone before you could even wipe your hands. The price isn‚Äôt cheap per head but when you factor in the entertainment for the night it‚Äôs well worth it for the experience, especially if it‚Äôs a special occasion."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3F5cTB3RRAB,Not a great experience.  We went for a birthday and not great service. The food was nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoei1mQkRREAE,"I have fond memories of eating at Ginza Teppanyaki as a teenager in the 90s.  Today we took the kids there for lunch.  The kids had a great time, and were entertained watching the chef. The food was great too. It was a good as I remembered."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocmN5MjRBRRAB,"Was this value for money? No, definitely not. Portion sizes were tiny and we left hungry.  Spent $130 for 2 small miso soups, 2 small rice, 1 lamb cutlet,  2 small serve of squid, half a salmon fillet, small serve of rocking fillet, 2 small serve of bean sprouts and 1 small steak fillet. The serving sizes were child size. The price is basically robbery.  I Don't recommend this place and won't be coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoallMRmp3RRAB,Had a wonderful experience and the food and the atmosphere was amazing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaWFpaER3EAE,"Took my wife here for V-day and we had a lovely time. Our chef was friendly and happy to have a laugh, but cooked the food beautifully. More traditional style of Teppanyaki, and our table had a blast. Plenty of food so you won't leave hungry, and my wife got a token for the Candy Floss vending machine which was a nice touch (it's meant for kids haha). Would recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMGNUVVp3EAE,Lots of fun!! Food and service was awesome!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMXVuTVh3EAE,Great place and food‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNnVEM0t3EAE,"Great experience with friends. Friendly staff, Food was great and the use of tablets for ordering makes it really easy to get drinks, service was instant which was impressive. 5 stars if they'd let us split the bill."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocXN5Q3dBRRAB,"Helpful, polite staff & reasonable prices"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob3AzUlhREAE,Went as a group of 12 for my partners birthday. Aiden the chef was very entertaining and put on a great show! The staff were very attentive. Highly reccomend :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocUwtdUJBEAE,Good experience overall but not value for the high rates that are charged. The staff was very friendly though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOFBfZ3JnRRAB,"AVOID: Terrible food, paid $300 but not even worth $30. The waiters were good, but it seemed like the chef had no experience and was just trying to finish his shift. All of the meats were overcooked, all of the games seemed like gimmicks (I have been to teppenyaki where the chefs are a actually talented, not the case here). Overall would AVIOD at all costs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOEpfaHRBRRAB,BEWARE!! The most underwhelming experience after having paid $100 per person. They've got amateurs behind the grill and it seems like they're still in culinary school trying to learn how to cook.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNjhTMmR3EAE,"Family night, tepinkayi grill,  meat lovers.. went all to quickly. Great food, guy on the grill was great.  Drink service a little slow... no biggy.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4N1B5MTl3RRAB,"Normal, the meat is too thick, can be better. But the beef slides are perfect"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LU1tWHN3RRAB,"Not the best, but above average! Reasonable price and very friendly service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE9pTHFBRRAB,"Went there for dinner on Monday for a special occasion the service was excellent, food was amazing, and the ambience was superb. Had a great night would definitely recommend if you want a special dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0xtcVFBEAE,"Authentic Vietnamese Pho soup base üëç Come to eat every time you pass by, recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDVlQ2d3RRAB,"We left this restaurant feeling frustrated and unsatisfied.  It was really hard to get any service from our main server, wearing a white dress.  Our food took over 45 minutes to arrive. Which seemed crazy considering it was all raw and required us to BBQ ourselves. There was no communication about this from staff.  Upon receiving our order we noticed some things missing from the descriptions. We were told they weren't included in our package. Only when I pointed to them on the menu next to our selection, The server crumpily told the kitchen to go prepare, but still no apology or communication.  It also felt very overpriced and dry.  The only saving grace was that some of the other front of house staff were friendly.  We won't be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnZtR01REAE,Excellent food and service! Definitely will come back soon!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXZ5bVR3EAE,"The 4 people course set meal was so fulfilling. Meat was very fresh and tender. Staff gave amazing service, so polite and friendly. The seating wasn‚Äôt too comfortable, was a bit awkward getting in and out to go to the bathroom."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMm9mYTdRRRAB,"Went here for just a random Sunday night dinner. This place‚Äôs all you can eat has been on my list to try for a while. First of all, you need to know about the ‚Äòall you can eat‚Äô menu and ask for it because they don‚Äôt provide you with that menu when you sit down. The owner asked about any allergies and confirmed if we would like everything listed on the ‚Äòall you can eat‚Äô menu. We were not sure how the ‚Äòall you can eat‚Äô part worked or if we were allowed to order the listed items again because after ordering, the menu was taken away and everything just came out as if it was a set menu. It wasn‚Äôt until the end of our meal that a waitress came by and asked if we would like any more meat. This clarified that we were able to order more within the ‚Äòall you can eat‚Äô menu. Upon looking up the menu online after we finished our meal, we realised that were a number of dishes that weren‚Äôt served to us despite the owner confirming that we would like everything listed. Despite this debacle, it was a really delicious feed, nice experience and good atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbDlTMV9RRRAB,"Lovely place to eat at - the quality of service was top tier. I spent my partner‚Äôs 30th here and we felt extremely welcome. The staff were accommodating and even though we sat beyond 2 hours of the all you can eat - they told us that we should still take our time and just enjoy the food. They also gave us desserts for the birthday! Although expensive, the service makes up for it and the atmosphere felt warm and comfortable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjRiYnlBRRAB,delicious meat fresh
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMG9IRHZnRRAB,"I've been here five times. The beef is very delicious, and it tastes good when it's roasted, but the drinks are having too much ices in it and the food is not served efficiently, but otherwise very good, and I recommend it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc09iVWdnRRAB,"Eel rice is delicious, skewers/chacha beer is definitely not recommended! ! !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobjlleWVREAE,"I made an online order and immediately received a call from a very polite and attentive lady who confirmed some details of the order, and checked some mistakes I made when placing the order.  Delivery was fast, the products arrived very well packaged, the food was absolutely delicious.  The  price is expensive but it's worth it. Very good costumer service and high quality food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX2RPaTl3RRAB,"I used to work here and from an employee standpoint this is a terrible place to work and I would not recommend working here if you have another job. You cannot learn and demonstrate hospitality here. If you don‚Äôt speak Cantonese you won‚Äôt be treated well. Even though there are customers coming in, I don't know if the manager pretends not to notice or dares to ignore them, when I told her ""there are customers coming in"", I treated badly. There are many wait person but only a limited number of people take orders, and when I occasionally took an order and told the order-taker, they forgot about it, making the customer wait a long time. I feel sorry for the customers, so I couldn‚Äôt work comfortably."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGJMRWdBRRAB,"Quality meats, with amazing selection and Great service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNWFQLWN3EAE,"Very tasty, tender, fragrant beef. All dishes are excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGFyRl93RRAB,I do not recommend ordering an Uber
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeGNyM0lnEAE,Employees are very disrespectful towards people
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeFlxenR3RRAB,The employees are very bad
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWRYc1FnEAE,Had a great experience here. Food was amazing. The service was also top notch and the owner really looked after us. Will definitely be back soon.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmNhWTRRRRAB,"Good food, great service, very worth the price"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNllhZmV3EAE,"Food is top quality Japanese meat, the customers are very nice and helpful. Would recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa0pYY2JnEAE,"Took my friend for her 40th had a pleasant experience. We had the set menu, plenty of food and it came out pretty fast. Good food and friendly service will definitely be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDdyUnZRRRAB,"seafood not fresh, advertisements on windows are cheating."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWQ2OEh3EAE,really average üò¢
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNXFma3VBRRAB,good taste and good quality
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN0p1Y0N3EAE,"Be careful before going, read all the advertisements carefully, the final explanation is best to let the merchant explain in advance, and be grateful for the promotion behavior of the merchant, every time you order a dish, you must ask the merchant to explain clearly in advance, otherwise you will lose your stomach if you eat it Understand the details clearly, draw the key points, and have the final right of interpretation, dddd If you do not understand Chinese, don‚Äôt go, otherwise you won‚Äôt know what the financial explanation is!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN0lEdFRnEAE,"Crabs are not freshly killed, and one piece of meat may be loose and one piece of meat in the same crab is normal and firm. The activities of the posters are also deceptive. They said that they sold out and said that the final interpretation right belongs to them. This sentence is really 6."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdE42MEd3EAE,The old man with glasses is very very rude. We finished the food and started talking. We didn't bother anyone. The old man urged us to leave but there were no customers behind. Is this how Hong Kong people treat their guests?     Please pay attention to your words and deeds.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdE1UMnZRRRAB,"Been attracted by their promotion but that turns out to be limited hours only, 5-6pm and 9pm onwards. Received massive bill during regular dinning hours. Also, not sure which dish isn‚Äôt fresh but 2 out of 3 in our group got diarrhea after the dinner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOElIRnpnRRAB,Discount crab! Very good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeEt6R3ZBRRAB,Tastes mid but portions are good and fresh with simple ingredients.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMWRpWUJnEAE,The rudest waiter.  They won‚Äôt tell you the origin of the lobster and crab.  I won‚Äôt eat here ever again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdmJLenJ3RRAB,"In Maoben, you can eat Cantonese cuisine that is close to the people + down-to-earth + authentic. Friends who like Cantonese cuisine in Maoben CBD can experience it once. The imperial concubine chicken must be eaten"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMU9fU0tBEAE,"Went into the restaurant with a 3 year old and a pram, to see a selection of sea mammals and then come in as a family.  We were kicked out and told to look outside. I didn't know that this restaurant was only for Asians. Sorry, we won't be coming back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcnB1TU53EAE,"Great place if you love sea food. Other items on the menu was average. Paid parking near by, free on street parking not worth fighting for. Worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMUlxUzZ3RRAB,"Hands-down Seafood Street is my favourite place to eat Lobster with Noodles.  Also, when I was there, every single dish I‚Äôve seen the waiters/waitresses bring out for others smelt and looked deliciously yummy.  I would definitely come back to try the other food they have to offer because I love eating.  This is definitely a restaurant I would recommend for their fresh seafood, taste and speed.  So if you love your Lobster with Noodles definitely check out one of my favourite restaurants for it, Seafood Street."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdDRIeXhnRRAB,üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº good taste
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdmVHd3VnRRAB,Pricey and tasteless
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd29lenNnRRAB,"Service: Waiting time from ordering is rather fast. But the staff were inattentive when we asked for a follow up order, they forgot about it until we reminded. Food: We ordered sweet and sour pork ribs, prawn+spicy noodles, and seafood rice. Seafood rice is 4/5, pork ribs 3.5/5 (fried pork cuts are hard to chew but the flavour is okay), noodles 1/5. Verdict: first and last try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOUoyX1NREAE,Dumplings oh what can you say But it is a bit salty hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNWVuZTRRRRAB,"Bit pricey, very rude staff, food was not ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaElEd1NREAE,"Best Cantonese late night seafood comfort food around! We‚Äôve tried quite a few dishes and all but one are nothing short of excellent. Don‚Äôt bother with the seafood tofu clay pot. Other than their signature dishes (which are all awesome), a must try is the tiger prawns vermicelli clay pot. So so good! Seafood is always fresh and cooked really well.  Service is prompt and staff are ok! The premise is pretty clean. As good as you can expect from restaurants of this genre. We will always come back for more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMDZqS29RRRAB,"Very disappointed experience , the lobster is not 800gram as they advertised . And the quantity of every dish is so small , the service  have a big space to improve  . Never ever come back"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlamZHNTFBRRAB,"Don‚Äôt understand the minimum $20 spend per head rule. We are a group of 6 adults and 1 kid. We ordered some seafood and 4 regular dishes. The staff telling us it‚Äôs not enough food, ask if we need to order more. They try to make each person to order 1 dish. So pushy, makes us uncomfortable. Agree with the other comments, this place is not running their business the right way and should be reported to council."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dlBTdlZ3EAE,This is the finest Cantonese restaurant in the word. Period.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mkt1LWNnEAE,"For the price of the food, the ambience and the service this restaurant is not what it should be. When comparing to other experiences and many fine dining restaurants I have visited, I was reminded of Chinese restaurants I went to in my childhood which were nowhere near this price point. There were some dishes which clearly were different to an average Chinese restaurant however these were not something I would excitedly tell a friend, family member or acquaintance. Innovation is lacking and I am hopeful for what is to come if this does take place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajlLaXB3RRAB,Amazing food and service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTVyZ3BBRRAB,Food is very average. Not what you expect when you're paying $600 for 3 people. We walked out feeling hungry. Very disappointing. I expected the highest quality food for this price and I know other Chinese restaurants that are much better for a third of the price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzZMY3dRRRAB,"Had a really great experience at Flower Drum!  Service was great, had a quiet dark atmosphere. Had the 6 course and the 5 course menu. I'd definitely revisit, but there was an insane amount of food. It was definitely worth the price as every dish was amazing. The highlight was the Jade Tiger Abalone Crystal Noodles for me.  I've labelled the photos to describe what the courses contained.  Didn't take photos of the desert, but we had Baked Chestnut Sago Crumble(This was great with amazing white cream)  Almond Cream with Sesame Dumplings (This was amazing - reminded me of a dish I had when I was younger)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOGFfNFBREAE,The food was lovely. Service was great you really get looked after.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMFpLQ1pBEAE,Manager named Barry was ignorant. Did not accomodate with our orders and one of the waiter had to make up for him.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScExqZEVBEAE,"Best chinese food in Melbourne , must try , 5 star price"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLUtDVDR3RRAB,"What an absolute experience. Great staffs, very knowledgeable food and beverages, and they're happy recommending. We met the owner, the most humble person. Will definitely recommend this place to everyone, and all my neighbours."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEltTEh3EAE,Perfect.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDV1Z01nEAE,A very dated restaurant with cold service and ok food that doesn‚Äôt not justify the few hundreds of dollars for a meal. They were slow to bring our dishes and 10 minutes before the end of the 2 hour sitting they kicked us out for the next one despite having told them it was our wedding anniversary . I had better Chinese in much cheaper restaurants.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDVHRlNnEAE,You get treated like royalty when you dine here. Its my favourite restaurant to eat at. Top quality food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1llLW5BRRAB,Pleasant experience with good food.  Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Atmosphere 4/5
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmJqSEtBEAE,"Fantastic dinner at Flower Drum. Service and Food are incredible, highly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOExySUVREAE,Excellent Australian Chinese fusion.  Even better a month later.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN0pMb253RRAB,Perfect
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0otazVBRRAB,"I've read so much about the place which seems so highly recommended... But sadly, my conclusion is that it's overrated and subpar (to many other normal offerings overseas and epsecially those at the same price point).  Ultimately, I find it hard to justify visiting again due to the disappointment in expectations and the high price.  The food - the pekking duck was tasty, and I enjoyed the texture with the thicker and slightly chewy piece of meat compare to other places. The flavours were just right. (5/5).  The first taste of the soup in the large seafood dumpling with chicken both was great, but somehow the flavour didn't seem to last and the dumpling (with scallop and other nice things) could have been tastier (4.5/5). The pearl meat and crayfish omlette were quite good (4.5/5) but the portion sizes would only be a bit larger than normal fine dining.  The rest that we had (calamari, roast duck lotus leaf fried rice, sauted mushrooms, tofu) was hardly any better than other restaurants.  The service - in our experience, the high standard of service experienced by other visitors was just not found by us when we visited... (they seemed understaffed on a Monday evening and slightly overwhemled though the restaurant wasn't full).  I'm personally also not a fan of how dimmly lit the place was.  Concluding... Once again there was nothing exceptionally good to bring us back... The only thing exceptional was the high price for the quality of food and service provided (hence the 2 stars). There's so many other great places to eat at for maybe 1/4 of the price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0xPYTdnRRAB,"Really enjoyed the food. Worth the money spent. Food was very tasty. Prawn chives dumplings, lamb dish ( recommended by staff), mushroom dish , duck pancake and fried rice were ordered.good quality food made to perfection. Will come again. Would be great if you can improve on portion size."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN19HbG5BRRAB,Food and service perfect. A beautiful experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOThIaWZnEAE,The waiter was angry at us because we didn‚Äôt tips. What kind of service did you give. Terrible customer service ever. 1:No one top up the tea 2:the food was out on the serving table after one hour plus cooking time but still No one served for 5-8 mins. 3: our table waiter was missing at all time and other table waiter just ignored us. We got three person put our hands in the air for 5 mins. They still chose not to see us. This happen at least 5 times in 2 hours.  And the food. Omg. So bad. Where did you get the chef? 1: fired chicken not marinated. So blank. The skin of course is not crispy for sittingu at the serving table but not serving. The five spices salt(dips). No spice taste only too salty. 2: Wagyu beef. 100% not wagyu beef. You can tell by looking at it. Wagyu beef has the unique butter taste. And this is just normal steak. 3: Australia has the best lamb in the world. How did you cook the lamb chop without the gamey taste? 4: the bbq pork just food court standard with extra honey sauce on top. 5: the pearl meat is ok. Very average quality. Has a good flavour with right texture. 6: the pan fried fish can‚Äôt tell too much it‚Äôs too cold while I eat it. But still not too bad. 7: the fish noodles. Again can‚Äôt tell much. It was cold. But should be good if  it‚Äôs hot.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbmE2NWl3RRAB,Hands down the best Chinese restaurant around and probably one of the best places I have been to. Definitely worth checking out
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdFB1VGlRRRAB,Love this exquisite place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE1YZmVREAE,Incredible table service. Never had a better waiter. Dumplings great too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNTlHaFN3EAE,No good for vegetarians.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaGFURTVBRRAB,Food is fine however we felt the staff were pushy - we were asked multiple times for a tip and they input $15 extra onto our bill without asking. We ended up asking for it to be lowered but it was a bizarre way to end the meal and I won‚Äôt be returning as a result.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanF1bFJnEAE,Fantastic food and service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHNQOXR3RRAB,Long established dumpling restaurant with some deliciousness on the menu. We ate here ahead of attending to footy as service in generally prompt without trying to hustle you out the door.  Recommend the wantons in a chilli sauce and the crystal prawn dumplings and if you like a battered calamari then the salt and pepper squid is a great dish to indulge in fried food.  On this visit we found our dumplings could have been a little warmer although they were cooked through so perhaps sitting a while after steaming.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHV1bGVBEAE,Normal experience but the chilly is tasty
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXJ5NWdBRRAB,The fish head soup is the best! The interior design is beautiful and relaxing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMHFfR3V3RRAB,Most disappointing dumplings I've had for a very long time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdEt5ZzhRRRAB,"best dumplings in the city. The bouncer, who was also our waitress downstairs, is from the old school. Snappy, military, but friendly. Turned away dozens of non-reserved guests while we ate."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUpDNS13RRAB,Nice menu choice. Dumplings very good. A very entertaining waiter. Enjoyable evening.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMlBMMk9nEAE,"Good dumplings, good fried rice and entrees - touch more expensive than some of the other Chinatown haunts but good quality"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbU4zcllBEAE,"Appreciate that we can book a table but the waiter lost our order. Had to re order our food. Food came quickly and fresh but the XLB pastry is so thick. Don‚Äôt understand the hype. We tried the other 2 competitors with the massive queues and they more tasty. Sorry folks, don‚Äôt come for the XLBs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUxxekpREAE,Absolutely incredible dumplings! I didn't even know I could enjoy Dim Sum this much but the signature prawn dumplings may have changed my life. I would pass on the fried rice though. Staff was friendly and helpful as well. The building is small and you'll likely have to go up one or two flights of stairs for seating; make sure you arrive early or are ready for a wait.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk9PX3BnRRAB,Really nice food and good atmosphere. Service can be a little slow sometimes when it‚Äôs busy but overall a great choice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0tpcldBEAE,Was waiting to enter and a van parked outside with frozen dumplings for delivery... this place was my favourite place for dumplings but not  any more.. my wife does a better job. Not nice at all
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeC15QlR3EAE,"I generally don't encourage bad reviews but they really deserve it. If you like unpleasant tourist attractions, go for it. Rude staff and zero love in the food. Don't get fooled, the fire is out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaUo3TWVREAE,"Ordered fried rice and salt and pepper squid. Took 30 minutes for rice and the squid never arrived. This horrible service was already demonstrated as soon as I walked through the door. Stood at the counter for a solid 5 minutes even after a bunch of waiters walked past and looked at me and said nothing. Never going back again and definetely will not recommend this to individuals who expect even satisfactory service.  Edit: You will also get charged for tea here. If you want a true & proper Chinese restaurant experience, you're better off eating somewhere in Chinatown where the tea is complementary (like it always is at proper Chinese restaurants)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzZMSnhRRRAB,Came for the buns and fish soup Feel like never coming again... Probably only suitable for foreigners who don't understand anything
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHNYM3BRRRAB,so good and cheap!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXF6Y0xnEAE,"Came here as a recommendation and it was quite disappointing. Pan fried dumplings and soup dumplings were very doughy.  The wontons were the saving of this place - delicious and would have ordered more if we had known the other dumplings were average. Weirdly, the 1.5% card surcharge isn't shown on the tax invoice at payment which makes it difficult when reconciling expenses for a work dinner. Ended up paying the 1.5% separately just so we can reconcile the cost."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXV6bndRRRAB,"Best dim sum and dumpling place in Melbourne! If you‚Äôre seated on the first floor, you even get to see them make the dim-sums."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek9iT1VnEAE,Brilliant feed before going to AAMI park on a Thursday night. Not too busy. My mate said his chicken Shnitty was the best meal he's ever had in his life. High praise.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bVAzejVRRRAB,"It‚Äôs nice place with good food. Pretty noisy though. Service was ok, prices are ok. I really liked the pork knuckle, but didn‚Äôt enjoy the apple dessert"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c05PVDdBRRAB,"We spent the weekend in Melbourne and had dinner here on the Saturday night. We dined with another couple and had so much fun. The staff were wonderful, the food was sensational, and the music and entertainment was awesome. We will definitely be back for another fun night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN191TDJRRRAB,"This place never fails to entertain and feed.  Been visiting this establishment since 2013 and it‚Äôs still my go to for a solid beer and good feasting platters with my friends and family.  The only negative is the increase in prices, especially for the feast platter. Or simply, they could add a little bit more meat or even mashed to make it an absolute bang for your buck!  The music is a tad too loud, but it adds to the atmosphere. Lots of fun and laughters.  Will be coming back soon regardless! Can‚Äôt wait."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzVUQ3hBRRAB,"We had a great night. Fabulous food, great value for money. Service was terrific, the wait staff were friendly and attentive. We loved the live music too."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDVzLRAB,"You have to go on a Fri or Sat night. Live band, dancing, and singing makes for a fantastic atmosphere alongside hearty food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM2EyQmpnRRAB,This place is excellent. The service and the food were outstanding.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDluaE5nEAE,"This restaurant was taken by my friend to celebrate my birthday. The environment is very retro and the staff are friendly and the food is delicious. There are many choices of wine and they are very special and delicious. It just so happens that the singer there can sing Chinese songs (the moon represents My heart) sang delicious, will go again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDZpZ3VRRRAB,Sadly the place was too noisy to bother staying for a meal. Can only assume that the food is good there as there place was packed full of people.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTRHZ0RREAE,"I really like dining here. Dimmed light, cozy environment, delicious meal..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTh6SXVnRRAB,coming here soon i hope its good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemVlYTFBRRAB,"Great food, great service and great live music."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGRHQnRRRRAB,Great for large groups and parties.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVlITE9REAE,Bl**dy good service! Great atmosphere and people! If you want a fun ( and noisy) evening out try the Hofbrauhaus!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa1kzamxBRRAB,"They actually told us to stop singing. Cringe atmosphere that actually discourages a good vibe (singing, chatting). Cannot recommend this aside from serving 1L Stein's of beer"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFluaEtBEAE,"Always great here - food, service, beverages and atmosphere, top of the pile. The staff are so brilliant. If they'd more comfy chairs I'd never leave :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnFYX2VREAE,Brilliant food with great bier. What more could you ask for. Prost!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnZPM0N3EAE,"Great food, brilliant beir and amazing music, best vibes in town, I‚Äôve come here three times and never disappoints, highly recommend the pretzels, soooooo good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXB1dHpnRRAB,Great ambience and good beers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHBfVHlBRRAB,"Had a family 70th birthday booking for 45 people. A lot of planning and discussion with Fabian and the night could not have been more perfect. Food, Music and service all first class.  All guests have complimented on such a good time. Thank you for the night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHBxRm1nRRAB,Food was great  BUT the waitress assured us the dessert was gluten free. My wife has celiac disease  CLEARLY THE DESSERT WAS NOT GF AS SHE WAS UP ALL NIGHT WITH SEVERE STOMACH PAINS
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHN5SG13RRAB,Bit pricey on a Sunday
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXNUOUZBEAE,"Great food, unique atmosphere awesome little spot and fantastic beer"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDhHRHp3RRAB,Great food and fabulous service. I absolutely love this restaurant. Recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazlIVXhRRRAB,"Everything about this restaurant is perfect. The food was the best I‚Äôve ever had, the d√©cor and atmosphere were beautiful, and absolutely amazing service. I will 100% be coming here again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdG9HVXl3RRAB,"We dropped in for an unplanned late Saturday lunch.   The staff managed to fit us in but our courses were delivered quickly one after the other as the kitchen was closing.    Although the food came quickly, we were able to take our time to eat.    The food was very high quality - we enjoyed everything that we ate.   The price was reasonable for this quality of food.   It's a very pleasant setting and the staff were very friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSalp5bldREAE,One of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Melbourne! Everything taste delicious. Lunch menu is really good value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWRyUFN3EAE,"Had the Grand Shoya omakase. Some of the dishes (Wagyu steak, crab tempura) were quite good and the presentation was beautiful, but I don't think it was worth the hefty price: one of the other omakase options would likely have been better value. The service was very attentive and warm though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb1lmZmJnEAE,"Take shoes off, food is very well prepared and tasty. Upmarket though, not a quick snack location."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSckxINXZnRRAB,tasty
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbE5HWW9RRRAB,Everything was great. The food was lovely and service was impeccable
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDdtcHR3RRAB,Everything was so fresh I think the price was super reasonable for what was served Service was on point as well
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWZlb0xBEAE,"Beautiful  food, quick and professional service.  Staff were pleasant and attentive.  Highly recommend and will come back in the future."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOHJta0lnEAE,"Shoya has a great environment and good service and the restaurant has a professional preparation for Japanese-style food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for the lunch sets, especially the tempura and the green tea ice cream."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoekkzc1JBEAE,Quality food and service at a Melbourne institution. Always liked the food here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejQyNWdnRRAB,"Had an amazing experience here with my family! High quality food for reasonable price as I've had set menu for lunch. Thanks for friendly and lovely staff as well xx Such a shame that no one took a photo of any dishes as we were enjoying the moment, but everything was just perfect and we ended up so full hehe."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajhfYXNnRRAB,"We were a party of four and we all had one of the ~$40 set lunch menus. Great experience overall! The decor is cozy, the staff are friendly and the food came quick. All the fish was fresh and quite filling. The matcha ice cream at the end was also very nice! Highly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTh2UzlnRRAB,Amazing service and delicious food Sashimi was fresh and taste delicious Couldn't fault any of our dishes Tempura wow!!! Thanks Shoya for the amazing food and service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocTdqajlBRRAB,250pp
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaTZldGZnEAE,"Shoya tried to have a high price like Ishizuka and minamishima in Melbourne CBD during Valentine‚Äôs Day. I cannot see any seating privilege or attitude costing 250 dollars pp. The A5 Wagyu was really oily as the last main course. 250 pp deserves more. I am suggesting other restaurants if you have a budget of around 250pp. I was not feeling well and gonna puke about the oily fatty food. It feels like drinking oil. I couldn‚Äôt accept it and spit it out. Normally, the wagyu is acceptable for me in other restaurants. But it has unreasonable oily in one bite. If you are really fascinating on fatty food, I think this is a good place for experiencing. When I reported the problems, there were no solution."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocWVtUFdnEAE,"This one is literally sooo good. Loved the otoro and the snapper. High quality fish but reasonably priced. Worth five stars. One thing is that I wish I got more rice lol, too much sashimi, not much rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa1p6TWNREAE,The ambience in the restaurant makes you feel like you're eating in a Japanese restaurant in Japan. The food was excellent.. beautifully presented.. it looked exotic.. that I didn't want to ruin it by eating it. The taste was absolutely delicious.! If you're cravingJapanese food.. I recommend you to dine in here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4alAtMUlREAE,"Good ramen, fast and friendly service Noodles tasted a bit gluten-y and the chashu was just roast pork. The place has issues with crowding. God help you if you want a Thursday night dinner there. Gyoza was very tasty and the broth is very flavoursome, though I found that there was nowhere near as much broth as I was hoping for. Menu customizing is a big plus"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aU5HQy1nRRAB,This ramen was so good I felt like I was on a episode of Naruto I almost went to fight Sasuke after finishing the plate
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OFBTMDdRRRAB,One of the best ramen in Melbourne!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMy1XcU9BEAE,"Such rich and delicious broth! We had the fish taikei, which is the best fish ramen in town, and the black tonkotsu ramen - again a regular crowd favourite. Food quality was absolutely wonderful and never disappoints. Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjZqRWR3EAE,"Simple but delicious ramen. Service is efficient, you order using the QR code located at each table. Staff are always helpful. Can become crowded at peak times but the line alwaysovedls relatively quickly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScC12Z253RRAB,Best of the best ramen if your up for a quick bite! Xoxox
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNl83NkNREAE,"good experience , chicken is great"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWRpRm1nRRAB,Wow I never was impressed with Ramen until now
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWFtaWNnEAE,"Super flavourful broth, chicken karaage was also tasty and tender üòã toppings can get a bit pricy if you want a lot though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScGYzRkVREAE,Really delicious & quick
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnLUw3LVRREAE,"I was disappointed that the chashu pork looked like a bunch of chopped up off-cuts but the overall flavour was good. Also, it's starting to get quite pricey for something where an egg isn't included."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMGN5NnFBRRAB,"Amazing ramen and gyoza. Reminded me of being back in Japan again. Staff were very nice. Can be very busy and more ideal to visit solo or as a duo, but not so much for bigger groups. Can be a wait at times, but I felt like it was worth it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHVXVWl3RRAB,Best Ramen ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXNpLUR3EAE,"Did not disappoint, 45 min wait in the cold was still worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHJtNWZ3EAE,Dinner
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb29tRGFBEAE,"It was said to be a famous ramen, so I tried it. The meat broth was delicious. The first bite was very good, but the longer I ate, the richer the meat broth felt. The chopped kelp? is delicious haha"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeE9DczdnRRAB,Nice authentic ramen broth. Rich and creamy tonkotsu. Little pricey for what you get as a standard bowl. Dining experience was a little disappointing. Very crowded (elbow to elbow with strangers) on the bench and order via QR code with no staff interaction at all.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeF96S3NBRRAB,"My favourite ramen in Melbourne. I‚Äôve tried all the ramen on their menu several times over the past few years. It is so good that I‚Äôm there almost every weekend. Flavour, consistency and quality 10/10"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0xuMmdBRRAB,Very similar to Yilan ramen hahaha
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjZpTC1RRRAB,"First time visiting Hakata Gensuke, every time I come to Melbourne there are long lines outside this ramen joint but this time the line was a short wait. Once inside you are greeted by their lovely staff and are seated at your table. The restaurant uses a QR code to order and pay for your food. I ordered the signature tonkotsu and also I had the God Fire ramen and gyoza.  Tonkotsu was a very meaty broth and you can also add extras such as more seaweed and chashu. I had my noodles soft and this was definitely a delight, the ramen was very balanced and nothing was overpowering in this bowl.  The God Fire is their spicy ramen and I had it at level 2 and for chilli lovers it packs a punch but is still very enjoyable.  Their gyoza‚Äôs are made fresh and the filling inside was delicious, ordered 2 serves of this as we had to try another.  Definitely recommend for ramen lovers to visit Hakata Gensuke."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTViZTRnRRAB,super nice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbi1uenRBRRAB,Average
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSODdYTTh3RRAB,food too inconsistent for this price point. Particularly the polenta that came with the main was completely unseasoned?? really weird mistake.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX29LV2hRRRAB,Impeccable!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnBPV09BEAE,Love this restaurant especially the clams linguine.  Best clams this side of Sicily. Caio bella
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHNMNVpBEAE,"Very disappointed considering the calibre of Resturant. Ordered the bistecca and had it arrive with no salsa verde. I questioned the waiter and he told me it was on top of the steak, trying to pull the wool over my eyes. He got unlucky because I happen to be in the industry and when a fluro green sauce is missing it‚Äôs hard to lie to a customer. This waiter also appeared to be on some form of narcotics to the point he nearly fell over onto our table. Then spoke to the lady in charge and she was not helpful. She confessed there was no salsa verde but proceeded to do nothing about the issue. Plenty of other ‚Äúnicer ‚Äú places in Melbourne ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSakpXZHJRRRAB,"Food, service and atmosphere were all fantastic and it was a great experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEtyR2ZnEAE,"A wonderful experience. From the moment you walk in the door and up the stairs to the moment you leave, this is fine a dining experience that is above all else. Never dissapointed when we go here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM3AzTzh3RRAB,A lovely place with great food and very friendly staff. The service is immaculate
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdU9QeERREAE,What an amazing place to dine. Service and food was 5 star.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDhYYUdBEAE,Best restaurant in cbd.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaF9IWmp3RRAB,"We had a pre theatre dinner in the Cellar Bar on a Saturday night and we certainly weren't disappointed. The wait staff exuded Italian professionalism, all impeccably dressed and quietly efficient. (Dropped knife off the table? Discretely picked up and replaced.) The food was well presented and everything from the tuna stuffed peppers to the ragu and the saltimbocca exactly as you would have expected. I can't wait to come back to Melbourne with more time on my hands so I can experience The Grill and Florentino."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODZUWWZREAE,"Poor  quality food an atrocity to the history of the restaurant, but then again, synonymous with the self adulation of Guy Grossi. A very tragic conclusion to a Melbourne icon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoemFIN09BEAE,Had 3 courses which were delicious. 2 would have been substantial. Staff were friendly & professional. Never seen a wine list of this size. Would take a couple of hours to read it all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMVlXNkV3EAE,Food was very nice and also the restaurant. I‚Äôm impressed with the variety of Italian wine here. Friendly staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaWI2NmNnEAE,"Let me start by saying, if you're a fan of Italian cuisine, you're in for a real treat. The food is simply out of this world! From the fresh and flavoursome dishes to the perfectly cooked meat options (I still don't know how these magicians create pork that melts in your mouth!), there's something for everyone on the menu. And, of course, we can't forget about the tiramisu - it's to die for! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  But, it's not just the food that makes this place special - it's the atmosphere and the staff. From the moment you step inside, you're transported to a different world. The restaurant has a warm and inviting ambiance that makes you feel right at home. And, the staff - well, they're just fabulous! They're friendly, attentive, and always happy to go the extra mile to make sure you have the best experience possible.  Overall, I cannot recommend Florentino restaurant enough. It's truly a gem in the heart of Melbourne CBD. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner for two, progressing a business relationship, or a catch up with friends over a delicious meal, this is the place to be. So go ahead, make a booking, and treat yourself to an amazing dining experience - you won't regret it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMFlYbVF3EAE,"Top restaurant, fine food, impeccable service! Modern and classy, this place is masterpiece."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocnNLdGVBEAE,"Another Melbourne institution with timeless appeal. I have always loved the more informal bar / cafe area of Grossi Florentino. 2 lattes, and a lasagne with a glass of the French rose for $60. I spent a lovely couple of hours working and watching, whilst typical Melbourians (on the outside) were feeling the chill just to be seen üòÜ. Always a great vibe, with very attentive and beautifully manicured staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ3NTb1hBEAE,Such a great experience!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoM0ozWXRBRRAB,"A stunning example of fine dining. A passionate team who have immense pride in their offer and ensuring a memorable experience for their diners. Huge congratulations to the entire team and a special thank you to Hamish. The food was incredible and demonstrated expertise and flair garnered from years of high end service delivery. Flavour, flare and theatre; joy in receiving the food offered to you; you could tell there was pride from those delivering the food. Nuanced service of the various courses was cherished by us during the evening; a marble topped cheese trolley shrouded in muslin cloth screening a stunning selection of fromage; zabaglione served to the table directly from the bespoke copper pot. Sublime. Highly recommend this as an experience to share."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMUlyNXRnRRAB,"It‚Äôs easy to be a star for a minute , but it takes effort to be a star for a long time.  Elegant dining and mature service.  For the sophisticated diner. Still highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMkl5TDZRRRAB,Great service and food at Grossi Florentino last night. The sensational Franco and his colleagues definitely looked after us and made us a smile along the way.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeU9lRU13EAE,"TL;TR Pretentious and overpriced bland food 3 stars or 5 stars depending on what you are up too. You want to impress a date with well groomed waiters, beautiful table settings and high prices. It‚Äôs 5 stars for you. If you like delicious food, and care about presentation, flavour balance ‚Ä¶. It is a 3 star review."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4blAtZ1BREAE,Excellent English style pub with great food and beer varieties. Recommended
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aklLTHNBRRAB,"I started going here a bit when I found they had two English ales on tap, which was great.  Once recently, the Old Speckled Hen I ordered was completely carbonated, and disgusting. I simply switched to the Hobgoblin they had on tap. This beer wasn't carbonated and was at cellar temperature, and tasted great.  The next time I went in, with a friend who wanted to try a real English ale, we were served the Hobgoblin ice cold, as it must have gone through the cooling system with the other beers on tap. I politely brought it up with the manager, who instantly stonewalled, claiming that 'the whole cellar is ice cold'. I have worked in plenty of pubs previously, and can tell you that that statement is a categorical lie.  1 star for being a British pub that's unable to serve English ale properly. Would give -5 if I could. Go to the Charles Dickens instead, if you like English ale."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cExQM1lnEAE,Great place for a drink Good atmosphere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUltRDhBRRAB,"Sadly, this place could be so good, but the service was dreadful, slowest bartender I've ever met and we were rudely told to move from where we were sitting, even though the place was not marked as reserved. Were not offered another place to sit, just told to move. Luckily when we went to the ground floor, some other customers offered us a place to sit... Stayed for one drink and went elsewhere... can't recommend this place at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c01mSE1nEAE,I should have gone upstairs for a decent table. The little table wasn't cleaned.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c0tPUXdBRRAB,"I normally never give 1 star reviews but this place deserves 0. I advise you not to support this business at all. I came in without any acknowledgement from anyone at the bar. The ginger man with beard (apparently the manager called Sam) looked at me and then decided to serve the gentleman beside me, clearly knowing I was there first. At first I did not find an issue with this but when he finished serving him, glanced at me ( I was directly in front of him), then proceeded to serve the customers at the very end of the bar. I found his behaviour was so rude and discourteous, but, as a hospitality worker myself, I thought maybe he‚Äôs having a bad day and gave him the benefit of the doubt. It actually gets worse from then on.  My buzzer rang to collect food and when I came to the food collection counter, I was barely acknowledged at first and could see the servers eating chips and chatting around that area. Sam, without a word, rudely pointed the other side, I felt panicked and quietly picked up two dishes and placed them on the table. I realised I picked up the wrong dish and came back to the counter where I ordered. I apologised to the servers about taking the wrong dish but he said he couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. The manager asked what table number I was, found the docket and proceeded to slam the docket in front of my face. I looked at the docket and the server had put down the wrong order. I told the server I had clearly stated another item and he once again said it was up to the manager. I looked at the manager, he went to serve another customer through this dilemma, I felt so disrespected and upset, scared to argue back that I just took back the food. I asked my sister who was there with me when I placed the order, and she clearly stated that we had placed the correct order and the server had processed it wrong.  I didn‚Äôt touch that dish and had lost my appetite, I started crying and wondering why I felt so degraded. I have been a restaurant manager before and I understand that in hospitality it is important to simply acknowledge your customers with a ‚ÄòHi, how are you?‚Äô and attempt to find conflict resolution if something goes wrong on behalf of the hospitality team.  I was not at all rude and politely told them the order was processed wrong but it was the response by them that made me feel absolutely disgusted. In this case, I was happy to wait for my order to be made again but no attempt by management was made to fix the issue. I looked at other reviews about Sam, not showing respect for non white woman and wondered if it was race and/or sex that played into this, as I am a woman and a person of colour. I just couldn‚Äôt wrap around why someone would treat their paying customers with upmost disrespect and make them feel less than human. I strongly advise you to not continue supporting this business, my friend who has gone there for a long time was shocked about this as he personally knew Sam, and has mentioned to never come back. Such behaviour will get you losing new and loyal customers. I hope all staff at this venue rethink the way they treat people because their behaviour that night was appalling."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdl9palNREAE,Had to stay quickly as service was slow amd we had to go to a show
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjRQVW9RRRAB,"I waited at the downstairs bar for 10 minutes, it was not busy but they would not serve me. I cannot recommend a bar that wont serve you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjk3UUVBEAE,Great service here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbi1DdlRnEAE,Fantastic pub with a great atmosphere. Staff were very friendly and eager to help. The food was delicious and hot. Would definitely recommend pulling up a chair for a few hours.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTYzdmR3EAE,The food was the best I've had .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczQ3UHhRRRAB,"Great place for a meet up with friends or work colleagues. Great selection of nice beers on tap and a decent menu from snacks to dinner. I would only say, the best thing they need to do is turn off the auto fragrance dispenser they have over the ground floor bar. Soon as you walk into the place it smells like a men's urinal cakes. It's fowl having to smell that whilst trying to enjoy the taste of food or beer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzk3QkZBEAE,"only ducked in for a beer, but pretty decent spot"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzhMYlNBEAE,"Great Irish bar with large, quality meals."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2FhdHZBRRAB,Good food and great atmosphere
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGZtSFRBEAE,"Couldn't believe I was charged over $14 for 1 sticky date pudding with 1 dessert spoonful of ice-cream. Sticky date was stale and for the price I paid, really ripped off. I checked and re-checked the price was right and was met with cold replies of yes, correct price. Not a great experience at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVoyWmNnEAE,"Foods alright atmosphere well that depends on the day, the day of the week and time of."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVpqOVh3EAE,Paid $19.22 for a pint
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmQ3dUdnEAE,Great place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNlltaTl3RRAB,A wannabee English pub. Great service but something is missing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWMyNXJnRRAB,We got charged nearly 33 dollars for 2 asahi schooners of beer absolutely highway robbery and the don't have lube on the bar to ease the pain and staff were average at best terrible experience don't go there
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMXQtWVZREAE,Really nice place to relax with friendly staff
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek9Ma193RRAB,"This is my go to place for a quick lunch or dinner in the cdb or to fill in time waiting for a theatre show. ....much cheaper than the surrounding restaurants, and I usually enjoy the food more üòÅ Was particularly useful and yummy when Harry Potter and the cursed child played in 2 parts with a two hour wait inbetween each show. Whilest others lined up at nearby pubs and restaurants - I took advantage of this venue"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d09tSV9nRRAB,"Came in on 1st of May with two friends. Food was excellent and fresh. Staff were kind enough to remake part of my order, despite it being completely my error. Really appreciated the kind and accomodating service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWR1Sl93RRAB,"While we were eating, Yankee came and showed his face and choked. Crazy Delicious chicken and salad, friendly staff Vegan written on the bathroom wall"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWQyMWpnRRAB,"Ordered online, called to confirm location of pick up and it said the phone line was disconnected, went to the store and they said the order wants there, then called someone and said the order was re allocated to another restaurant, I asked where and they said they didn‚Äôt know so I asked them to find out and they said their manager would call, waited in total an hour and got no food, so terrible experience all round and no was to contact anyone by phone as there were no call staff or reception all numbers went to voicemail"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGRQVTVRRRAB,"Outstanding. Great food, wonderful service. I live in the CBD and Nandos at the top of Bourke St is one of my absolute favs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSblBpdWpRRRAB,Very busy for a Wednesday evening but food was great and service was fantastic
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHNXeENREAE,"Lots of tables, quick service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXFMNER3EAE,Best Nandos in the CBD.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3ZucERnEAE,Busy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ09QTHNRRRAB,"Nandos used to be my favourite. Then they started making the portions smaller and smaller and I stopped going. I thought I'd give it a try again and it's even worse. My sons kid meal was the largest meal. Table was sticky, toilets had not been cleaned for ages. No toilet paper. Thanks for reminding me why I stopped going."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjZfVjlBRRAB,"Unfriendly service,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbmZEaFdBEAE,The food was great. I'm rating 4 stars because they got my basting wrong. It was nothing I couldn't fix with the sauces available dining in.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c1BTanFRRRAB,"A good Nando's restaurant. Well prepared chicken. Chips were nicely done. Helpful staff when we took home food we hadn't eaten. A favourite of many of my friends, so any easy choice for a quick group meal. Recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMUpLZXVRRRAB,"Lovely service very polite staff, got a good vibe as soon as I entered the shop. Manager was very kind too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ0tfQ2N3EAE,"Why is the piece of chicken at a chicken restaurant in a burger that costs almost $15 so small..? It's not even an entire chicken breast. It left me feeling ripped off and unsatisfied to say the least... This is the second burger I've bought there and it's happened both times (the previous time was even worse), so it's no mistake. They are clearly price gouging here. For that money, just go somewhere else if you want a decent meal that will fill you up. The service when ordering wasn't great either. I felt like I was bothering them just by giving them my order."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobGVfSTBRRRAB,"Not bad, typical Nando‚Äôs.  Could be cleaner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLW9uUEh3EAE,The best Nandos outlet out of them all somehow. Food and chips seem to be always freshly cooked on the spot and hot.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSakt6MHBRRRAB,Unexpectedly great. Banging house music banging dishes and banging cocktails. Our waitress was attentive and watchful and even brought some homemade ice scream for the birthday girl. Expensive but quite the experience! Will return. I am sure.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk9XbXRBRRAB,"Dined here a couple of weeks ago, and we found the service was lacking. Not being pedantic, as we both have a decent tolerance for these things, but this was disappointing. The restaurant was 3/4 full but we struggled to get staff‚Äôs attention for ordering, they would walk by and not even look at the table to see if we needed anything. Ordered drinks whilst we continued to look over the food menu - however, the drinks had still not arrived when the food started coming to the table. Despite reminding staff we were waiting. No apologies, just got told ‚Äúthe bar is busy tonight‚Äù, like it should be our problem they are busy. Staff began clearing our dinner plates when we once again said we were waiting for our drinks, and they just so happened to arrive at that same time. Staff they joked, ‚Äúsee here they see!‚Äù. Not impressed. A little genuine acknowledgment they we were receiving ordinary service would‚Äôve gone a long way. Cocktails were tasty, but nothing exciting. Food was alright. But we were left with a bitter taste from how we were treated. Birthday dinner kinda ruined."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemVKORAB,"Great place, the food is fantastic, the drunken noodles and rendang roti are amazing. Great service, good vibe."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmVYWktREAE,Delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjdxSThBRRAB,Nice selection of craft beer and good cocktails
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN2VtSzhBRRAB,"Average tasting food, not horrible but not in line with the reputation Magic Mountain has. Food quality seems to be declining from late last year. Unfortunate as the menu has great options and good variety. Staff unwelcoming and unhappy. We felt like a nuisance to man who was serving us. The saving grace was that he did help us out when one dish was too spicy and he got the chef to add more coconut cream."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaWYtQnFRRRAB,"This place had feel good vibes from the moment we walked in. Staff were quick to get us seated and communicated efficiently between floors using a headset. The lady at the door was fantastic, she provided us the wait staff members name (Montanna) to meet at the top of the stairs. Every staff member we interacted with seemed genuinely happy to be there!  Montanna seated us and suggested a variety of choices from the menu, tailored to our request.  Every dish was presented immaculately and the flavours were iconic! The small plates came out within 15 minutes, the mains took a little longer (around 40mins later) however they were absolutely worth the wait.  We were pre-warned by friends about the amount of chilli used at this place - if you're not a fan of spicy food ensure you request to have the chilli toned down."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNlltM2ZBEAE,"For this small establishment, the food is incredible Asian Fusion that will have a party going on in your mouth.staff are super friendly, but the food and cocktails are amazing. Thank you for the experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGMyQU9REAE,Amazing service who gave us tips on what to order. Food was unreal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodnZtaGNBEAE,Amazing food and heaps of vego options. Friendly and helpful staff. Definitely on my return list
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoenJlWVFBEAE,"I had lunch here a number of years ago and wanted to return because the food was great. The food was still great when we went for dinner: decent portions, flavoursome and saucy, and with a bit of a spicy kick.  However, there was more than one mishap which occurred during the night. - Waiter took our orders and all was correct when repeated back to us. But then we were given pork baos when we ordered the Peking duck rice pancakes; we had to send it back. We never received two of our dishes: fried chicken ribs and roti bread. Unfortunately we didn't realise until near the end when we just didn't bother. - There was a hair in my passion punch mocktail that I found while drinking through the straw and felt a strange strand go into my mouth. The waitress did take it back, refunded the drink and gave me a new one. - We received a cocktail drink that wasn't ours (Samantha Jones) but we did decided to keep it anyway. - When we received the bill, we had been charged for the roti bread that never came (the chicken ribs were not there) and there was a mistake with the drinks' portion.  Given it was a busy Saturday night, but this many mishaps has never happened before. It's unfortunate because we liked the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoei1qd05REAE,"The service and the food are outstanding, I'll be back with more time to enjoy the place and other beers.  Strongly recommend to accept the spice options on your food, it has the perfect level"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWJPQ2VnEAE,Fab city staple for thai fusion and the best spicy Marg I've had in a long while!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeVlhSmR3EAE,This is a really funky restaurant that has three levels and a DJ. The menu has a great variety of dishes to choose from. I tried the pork belly bao buns which were so delicious and filling. I also had the duck noodles that had great flavour. My friends had the pad Thai and the fried chicken which were both great!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodVBtbElnEAE,"Food was delicious, cocktails were fantastic and the overall vibe of the venue was great. Only downside was that the bar staff kept forgetting our drinks but the wait staff definitely made up for it with their hospitality."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb2JiRGlnRRAB,"Will be back to try more dishes  Yeah Silken Tofu, Shiitake Mushroom & Star Anise Broth Sticky Pork Sticks & Shrimp Rice, Shredded Omelette, Apple & Mint Salad snapper sandwich Thai crepe cake  Nah Kale and crispy pork  Maybe Tofu red curry Black rice Pannacotta Pad Thai ‚Äì Rice Noodles, Egg, Pickled Turnip Garlic Chives & Peanuts - spicy Grilled Pork Belly, Poached Eggs, Daikon Croquettes & Smoked Tomato Relish + Fairy Toast - pork belly like sampgeopsal but daikon croquettes are good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbC11QTlBRRAB,"Went to magic last night for dinner ! Thank you very Monty and chloe for the amazing service!! Love the food and drink .specially duck pancake , soft shell crab curry ! So good üëç"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdGU2VjFnRRAB,Very good service from all girls
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd2Zic3JBRRAB,Quality food and friendly staff helped us select incredible options based on our group's tastes and dietary requirements. Staff were very accommodating to move us to a booth upstairs halfway through our meal. Would highly reccomend this venue for parties and gatherings of all sizes!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdlBDblpBEAE,"Thomas was a great host and waiter, what a legend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbks2Y1lBEAE,"Booked for 8:30, arrived at 8:35 and was told they were still clearing/setting up our table and asked our group of 8 wait in the walkway. We waited until 9pm to be seated without any formal apology, kind of just treated us like it was normal to wait half an hour for a table we had booked for. If bao buns are $20+ on the menu I kind of expect that they'll come made and not require us to assemble them, bit disappointing. Thankfully they tasted nice, the pad Thai and salmon curry was lovely too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdUtlTy1nRRAB,"Came here for dinner tonight with a couple of my colleagues and loved it! Service was great, staff were friendly, food tasted a treat, and great selection of drinks üëå Loved the calamari, chicken wings, and fat noodles. Will return, thanks guys!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbTVISjdBRRAB,"One of Melbourne‚Äôs must eat-at restaurants. Awesome vibe, fantastic drinks and the food is just superb!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUtmYzhBRRAB,staff were friendly and helpful. we enjoyed all our food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEpQZ0VREAE,Recommend the brisket burger
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c1BISjZBRRAB,"Very hospitable and friendly even in a busy time. After I asked the chef whether or not I ordered sufficiently for my group, he said not to worry and if we need more he would send another extra dish free of charge and he did so which was very kind of him."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzh2ek5nEAE,"Me and my boyfriend went for dinner before comedy show last night and wow the service was incredible from the moment you walk in, the food was cooked to perfection, we got quit abit as we like to try everything and all of it was amazing ! Would highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamYzdEpnEAE,"Great food, with great value and generous serving sizes. Genuine authentic American BBQ smoked meats and vegetables. Absolutely loved the pork ribs and even the corn ribs were surprisingly amazing. Easily the best corn I've ever had. I'm not a vegetarian but I found myself picking at my partners vegetarian dishes as they were shockingly good (for vegetarian options hahaha). Even the hot sauce selection was generous and tasted amazing!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOVppQjdBRRAB,"Food was quite bland, needs seasoning (there was no salt or pepper on the table either). Meat came warm and not hot, so it quickly got cold. It would be better to serve it on a hot plate to keep the meat warm."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScFlfbzNBRRAB,Always a winner here. The food is some of the best BBQ in Melbourne. The staff are great and I love that you just order at the table through the QR Code when YOU are ready and that avoids wait staff hovering. (I'm sure they love this too) Awesome rooftop area as well.  Highly recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWJPU1h3EAE,Came at 10pm and was closed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVlDTkpBEAE,Great experience with such personal and welcoming service. Food was delicious but we couldn't get a photo as we ate it all! Lovely and creative drinks that were just as delicious. üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN1BETDBnRRAB,Awesome brisket!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOU9LZ29BRRAB,"Great food, quick service- would recommend to anyone in the area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzlUZXR3RRAB,Loved this place! Incredible space and very cool vibe. Ribs were amazing and really good value. Great views as well from the window seats. Can‚Äôt rate it enough (except for the QR codes) but that‚Äôs just me! Will be back .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDRIS1VREAE,"Great service and great food, corn bread is to die for. Overall great experience and reasonably priced."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGZfaXVRRRAB,We were so happy with our meal here! We are from the U.S. and were looking for good BBQ in Australia.  We definitely found it at Fancy Hank's!  The brisket was perfect and the ribs had an amazing crust on them.  We really liked the cornbread too! The service quality absolutely met the quality of the food as well.  We would totally recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good BBQ.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGYtUHBRRRAB,Ribs weren't quite flavorful and not tender. Possibly needed to cook for longer on lower heat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2JDTlpnEAE,"Everything was great, the food was authentic and great service. I look forward to coming back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnNlLURnEAE,We had the premium platter and there was enough food for the 2 of us. Meat was perfectly cooked. Service was great so all in all we had a great time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenVHYk53EAE,"Phenomenal! Enourmas servings, brilliant service, food is just like I had in Tennessee and South Carolina. We also love the gorgeous 1930s ballroom its set in. Was worth the big drive from Warragul."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeS1QSXJBRRAB,The worst thai food i ever had. My pork noodle soup is SWEET!? And my friend‚Äôs kway chap noodle is glutinous like goo. Disgusting. Please avoid at all cost.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMkk3czZRRRAB,One of the best authentic Thai in town!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNXNQNU1REAE,"I chanced on this little gem because most other restaurants were busy. I had a steamed barramundi and a  pork salad. I was amazed the authenticity and taste of their dishes.  It is similar to that of Thailand.  The dishes  were not loaded with sugar or extremely sour.  And from hearing patrons talking, there were actually Thai people there. That says much."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHRtdXR3RRAB,Great value and taken to thailand.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScE5mTmRBEAE,The Pad See Ew was amazing! So rich in flavour and wok hey. Really decent prices too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk1lckNBEAE,Great authentic Thai food üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzVQUG13RRAB,The duck skin was not roasted and was the wrong colour. Noodle had no taste. The pork and rice was nice and spicy. But the crispy pork skin is not that crispy and the pork was too little.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWJTMjlnRRAB,"A real gem of an eatery! I've only been after business hours and would expect a wait when they're busy. The demographic of diners says it all: very popular indeed! Can recommend (#11) Kaow Soi Gai: a bowl of soft Thai noodles topped with fall-off-the-bone chicken pieces in a subtle but slightly sweet curry sauce topped with some crisp fried noodles. The spice heat creeps up on you, so western palates be warned!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXF6S3hBRRAB,Yum!!! Hands down best food court dishes! I am working my way around to try everything on the menu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc01QRzVnRRAB,Superb
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMEpXbXp3RRAB,As the name says it all...one of the best Thai in melb city! We had the sticky rice pork skewers ($15) and fish soup egg set ($17)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWEtZG1BRRAB,"People rude,taste horrible, slow service ,never never go again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaWJqNENBEAE,Small Thai kiosk in the food court with an authentic Thai flavor. There are too many Thai dishes to try if you love Thai food. Not a fancy place but the taste and the price is good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXFhUmp3RRAB,Great and caring service. Made a special soup for me.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNU11UmFREAE,Yummiest Creamy Tom Yum noodle soup I‚Äôve had in Melbourne so far. Have been here consecutively for 3 weeks already! It‚Äôs so good that though each time I come I wanted to try other dishes but ended up ordering the same dish!  My husband ordered the fried rice today. On the sweeter side but still very tasty.Large portion. Waited a bit during lunch peak but it‚Äôs worth the wait. Very reasonably priced. Loved the old-school food court atmosphere too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNE9fM1lREAE,"I do love this shop and I've been loyal to it it for years.  However, some dishes could definitely be more authentic though.  Yet on the other hand, they have some of the best dishes that are hard to find anywhere else.  People love this place though and it's super busy.  Especially when the Thai students are in town!  I think I first discovered this place in 2019 when I was working at The Meating House.  Their Nam Tok has always been good.  Some other dishes you'll find that are interesting are things like Kanom Jeem Nam Ya.  A really nice turmeric fish ball noodle.  The boat noodle and Tom Yum fried rice is popular with the Thai diaspora.  I've seen khao kluk kappi on the menu too.  The service is generally fast, just understand that it's a busy food court though and your patience is appreciated.  Especially during these difficult times for hospo.  This isn't Bain Marie style like the other places and everything is cooked fresh.  If you live in the city, try some Isaan dishes here.  Keep up the great work."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodThxVzdBRRAB,Getting more expensive now.  Price hiked three times in the last 12 months.  Not worth for food court meals to be honest.  Hard to find seats during peak lunch hour in the food court too if dined alone.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWNXWlFnEAE,"Food court, taste is good, cheap and quantity!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodWNqcGFnEAE,We ordered 2 types of fried rice : the chicken and the mackerel fried rice.  They were quite nice but just be careful if you order the mackerel fried rice as there are fish bones in it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNGJMMDdRRRAB,"Delicious, cheap, Thai flavors, various menus"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM3RmaVBREAE,"Hidden in the Paramount Food Court but it's always busy. Decided to try.  Ordered 2 items: 1. Tom Yum Noodles with Pork. Flavourful broth with plenty of toppings. Huge portion, good value for money. 2. Chili Basil with minced pork. It tastes alright and comes with a runny f ried egg, which is always welcome.  Overall, it's a good place to have pretty authentic Thai food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHRUbm5RRRAB,Like Tom yum noodle here
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaUpEaXRBRRAB,"Stumbled across this place when a couple of our Thai options had long queues - located in an obscure little known food court in the Paramount basement.  Seeing families and small groups of Thai descend ordering from this stall, we settled on trying this place.  The person at the stall was very helpful in suggesting items we should order after asking what our preferences were and the spice levels we were comfortable with.  Ordered Number 17 - Chinese Broccoli with Crispy Pork and Rice, Deep Fried Tilapia and Rice with Original sauce and Som Tum Green Papaya Salad.  The crispy pork dish was very tasty but had some raw egg white in the fried egg, nice runny yolk though. The fish was crispy and well seasoned, went well with the sauce but the sauce did not taste great on its own. The papaya salad tasted as it did in Thailand and they did put the mortar and pestle to it.  The above were more like a local home cooked Thai food, no frills as you‚Äôd expect at a local food stall in Thailand but tasty and well priced. Portion size reasonable.  Be prepared to wait about 15 mins for the fish. Our order was ready all at the same time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoc01temhBRRAB,Who said you cannot find #authentic #goodfood in #foodcourt üòÅ this place is my to go lunch spot.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb19qUlV3EAE,Located in a Paramount Food Court. The food didn‚Äôt take long at lunch time but I was there just before people queued up tho. The stir fried crispy pork with kale was delicious. Papaya salad tastes like they mixed the sauce with vegetables instead of cooking it with mortar like traditional Thai way.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkt6RWVBEAE,"We had a family dinner celebration here and I must say ‚Äòwow‚Äô. The food and flavours was delicious, decor is beautiful and the customer service was outstanding. Excellent job team and we will be definitely be coming back for 2nd round!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE5DVVRnEAE,"Excellent place for a steak, the atmosphere was excellent. There service was also top notch. Would like a bit more traditional Argentinan food to be served with there excellent steaks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cEpib3VRRRAB,This place was on my list for a long time and lived up to the expectation. Entrees were the favorite. We could have split one steak for extra entrees but it was all great.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUliQnRBRRAB,"Had a such good moment that I even forgot my phone away e didn‚Äôt take any pictures. But food is impeccable, great wine selection, authentic atmosphere, but no doubt the best thing about San Telmo is its friendly and lovely staff. I can‚Äôt wait to come back for more Asado de tiras, alfajores and Malbecs!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bVBxSUlBEAE,Great selection of wine. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable about the wine list and food menu. Would highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eU9lbFpnEAE,"Best steak in Melbourne. Rib eye is my favourite. Great customer service by all the waiter and waitresses, especially by a young lady , Adonia. Superb customer service level. Highly reccomended"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aU5QRGh3RRAB,Another great recommendation from Bob Champion‚Ä¶if only I was sharing the Hanger steak and char grilled beans with James Maurice Vedelago ü•∫ ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d05XU0NBEAE,Amazing staff and A+ food. All the atmosphere was great.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzk2VE9nEAE,"We had booked outside but the team managed to get us inside with only a 20 minute wait. Really appreciated it as it added to the ambiance. We did the mid ramge set menu and it was amazing, Empanadas were on point, Cervice was delicious.  Chimmichurri + rib eye was great and the lamb was an unexpected highlight. Great selection of Malbec's and comprehensive cocktail and wine list. Had a sour cocktail which was nice but could have been a little more sour. Would definitely recommend San Telmo and it will be a guaranteed visit for me each time I'm in the city."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzdienN3RRAB,Had an amazing date night dinner here at San Telmo. The steak was the best we have had in Melbourne. Can't wait to come back again soon.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzZMVWtnRRAB,Surprisingly nice restaurant for full Argentinian experience. Good meat well cooked
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSajhQUndnRRAB,"What a fantastic meal. We dropped in, without a booking, and were looked after beautifully. The service was excellent and the food was exceptional. Thank you"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbi1EUjh3RRAB,May 2023 - I have been wanting to come back just to have the pork jowl again. It was a life changing dish. It is my favourite dish of any restaurant from all countries I have travelled. The steak was also mind-blowingly delicious and pared perfectly with the Malbec that was recommended by the staff. There was nothing I could fault for this whole experience. The prices reflected the quality and I felt I got value for money. (And I can be quite frugal)  Approx 2019 - The food had so much flavor and was done perfectly. I would recommend this place for sure.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTREcjBnRRAB,"Exceptional service, amazing food and wine - all in a perfectly lit, relaxed-yet-kinda-fancy setting with great energy. I highly recommend whatever specials they have - especially steak-related! I‚Äôll be back for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjdUUy13RRAB,"The personal attention was great, the food delicious, so was the wine. They respected a voucher that had expired last month, I could not fault them on anything."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScThxd0V3EAE,"American steak house, Australian beef, Argentinian cooking. The last time I ate before boarding the plane in Melbourne, I thought it was a good taste, so this time I went to Melbourne to bring friends to eat again. I had to wait for more than 30 minutes because I didn't make a reservation the day before, so I didn't wait, so I didn't have to wait for lunch today. Lucky lottery did not disappoint my friends, but the consumption is a little bit expensive"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeTVQLUNnEAE,"Excellent lunch, attentive and professional service. Great all round experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczVPWFhnEAE,"We had a team dinner here after a property shoot, we were lucky enough to get a table as a walk in, on a shared table which happened to be in a private space.  Service was incredible, had a really good experience with (Sut), food was even better, we had the striploin and wagyu, well cooked and lots of flavour, doesn't need to be paired up with sauce.  Striploin: balance and cooked medium rare, the balance in fat and meat was rich in flavour, we preffered this over the wagyu,  Wagyu: very lean, lot of flavour with a more leather like texture ( wasn't the house favourite but it was still an experience)  Raw fish with coconut milk was divine, lots of flavour as an entrees,  Black sausage something different thats for sure, flavour was great.  Tartar paired with the home made chips was incredible.  Dessert: Flan was easily one of the best I've ever had, it was paired with cashews and toffee, incredible.  Reasonably priced too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmRTNENnEAE,Been twice now. Very consistent!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmRpWGlnRRAB,Best steak + best customer service had in a while!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSclktbzRRRRAB,"Great vibe, food and service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSclp1MkpBEAE,"First time visit San Telmo, experience the delicious food with quality of service so will definitely come again. We was rushed for movie so we missed dessert. Will share how the dessert are in the futureüòâ  Highly recommend the steak here, because the good food take time to cook, visitors could come early when they not that hungry or oder some lovely entree. Outdoor seat also available if you like to enjoy sunshine while tasting food. Wine and mock tail are both great. Definitely worth to give it a try üëçüëçüëç"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjVpODJRRRAB,First time here! Everything was so yum!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemNUcDJnRRAB,"Bottega never disappoints. My last visit was with 19 of my closest friends, each of whom was very happy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeVpTRjBBRRAB,"I ordered the pan seared Dory fillets, it was probably one of the worst fish dishes I‚Äôve ever eaten, tasted like they had microwave the ones you buy in the box at Coles. It was very small. Partner ordered the Lamb. Whilst the meat was delicious way too much fat. Very disappointing. The only positive was the duck ravioli. We won‚Äôt be back üëé"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaXBqTEdBEAE,"One of the best beef carpaccios I have had for many years. I would come back and order this for starter, secondi and dolce! Lunch with old foodie friends. Followed up with Porcini risotto - seasonal Victorian mushrooms, black garlic + 30 month Parmigiano Reggiano, 250gm flat iron steak ‚Äì (Gippsland, pasture fed, MBS2+), Mediterranean herb butter, rucola + aceto balsamico. The young waiter just here from Italy was friendly, knowledgeable and engaging - great service!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkpyaFZBEAE,"booked for a business Lunch, Service was on point, staff were discreet and proffesional - Food was fantastic"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjRURWZnEAE,Staff - 10/10 our waiter was amazing and tantative. Food - 6.7/10 we expected alot more after reading many good reviews but found the food very average and lacked alot of flavour. There are many better Italian restaurants within the vicinity.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHBqamd3RRAB,"Wagyu and kingfish entrees were nice, mains Moreton Bay bug pasta (before I even had a bite I could smell the fishy off seafood, pasta was not Al Dente) duck ravioli was nice, as the ragu and The dory. Disappointing steak. Missing 2 stars due to one of the dishes not being fresh and the way our table was arranged my chair was seated infront of another table and everytime the staff had to go behind me it was a struggle for the staff to try their best not to nudge me each time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNW9lTFlREAE,"Very nice dining experience. Super friendly and attentive waiting staff. Food is amazing, every course is spot on."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU9QdmFREAE,"Food was amazing, wagyu carpaccio was outstanding! Service was excellent, especially Ellen, thanks for a wonderful experienc."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTk2RkdREAE,"Best place for pre-theatre dinner in Melbourne by far. My wife and I have eaten at Bottega probably 20 times over the last few years and we have never been disappointed. The staff are all great and always remember our preferred table (thank you!), the food is consistently amazing and the pre-theatre menu is amazing value! Can't wait to come back :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcjl6RFdBEAE,Fantastic lunch. Only criticism is that the booth bench is very uncomfortable after 1hr.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1lTR2pRRRAB,"Thanks Axel for the hazelnut dressing tips. Carpaccio was amazing, staff are super, wine list fab"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNnZyV1JBEAE,"The food is absolutely delicious, staff is very attentive. I cannot wait to go back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHJlbUNnEAE,Food was average but the service made up for it. We had a great time celebrating a friend's birthday!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX09LM1JREAE,Great atmosphere and food for our anniversary celebration
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeklULTFBRRAB,I chose Bottega restaurant because of its booth seating so easy to have a conversation with friends I'm with.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNE1XNFdBEAE,"Great restaurant, food was lovely and the service was excellent"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocTREWDhBRRAB,"Service was friendly and attentive. Good selection of drinks. Disappointed by the quality of the food for the price. The pasta itself was overcooked, and the ragu tasted dry. Other items either lacked salt, or had too much salt (the croquettes for example, while tasty, really needed some sort of accompanyment to offset how salty they were)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobmItOEVnEAE,"Bottega is back! A very satisfying dining experience with beautifully presented food that is well balanced and delicious. Service is friendly and efficient. A very enjoyable evening. The pre-theatre service was not too rushed, but pleasantly paced. (As it sometimes can be). We will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMGE2ejBRRRAB,The quality of the food an service were unquestionable
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdE1UZ3RBRRAB,"I had an amazing San Valentin night üåô. The food was amazing, but the fish omg! Yummy üòã. I 100% will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNFpIeXlBRRAB,Dined in for lunch with everything being absolutely delightful from start to finish. We had the lovely Katarina and Hannah serving us which was the cherry on top of a beautiful lunch ü´∂üèª ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNGVHUEV3EAE,"Had lunch at Bottega, food and service were both exceptional! The Wagyu carpaccio in particular was a favourite, look forward to returning in the future."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cElhVFVnEAE,Had dinner last night on the spare of the moment it was very busy and the staff fit us in and serve our table super fast so we could leave and see a show we had book food was fantastic .staff was  amazing A+++++  thankyou we will be  back again for sure
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM19xbUd3EAE,"This place is cool. Great cozy vibe and fast service before a show at the theatre. staff were great, marinara spaghetti was awesome ü§åüëå"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMy1yMGhBRRAB,Delicious food and great service! Big pasta portions too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTlUOW1RRRAB,We were upstairs and enjoyed the entertainment themed walls. They were busy as entree arrived before drinks. Everyone enjoyed their meals and pricing was reasonable. They cater for the theatre crowd understanding needing to get in and have meals served promptly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemN6ODl3RRAB,Really lovely dining experience in an older restaurant. Everyone enjoyed their dinner and drinks. Personal favourite was the Veal scallopini. Can't talk to the desserts as they failed to ask us if we wanted any! Other than that the service was fine. Would still go back as the entertainment was fun and food was great.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenFDV0lBEAE,"Best lasagna, fabulous tirimisu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXRMazBnRRAB,"To their credit, the staff were very kind to accept my partner and me for dine-in dinner, less than an hour before close. Thank you.  Fish of the day was good, my partner really enjoyed it. Polenta chips were good but smothered in parmesan cheese so unfortunately it overpowered the chips. Carbonara wasn‚Äôt great, the pasta was a bit rubbery and the sauce needed more flavour.  Customer service was good, although I was confused and annoyed by the waitress who served our mains and didn‚Äôt clear the empty plate on the table from our entree. None of the other waiters walking past cleared it either.  The space is tacky and outdated. There‚Äôs some great original features but the carpet and lighting need updating.  You don‚Äôt get the experience that you would expect for the prices they charge.  Staff all asked us how our food was, but we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable giving an honest answer to their face. If they would like honest feedback it would be best to give customers a QR code they can use to leave anonymous feedback.  Overall, good staff but I wouldn‚Äôt go back unless I was stuck with limited options."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVBic3ZBRRAB,Enjoyed a lovely meal with friends
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb082cHB3RRAB,"What a beautiful welcoming atmosphere, as soon as you enter the spaghetti tree you are overwhelmed by the beauty, from the smells from the kitchen to the live music playing and just the general buzz of a busy restaurant. We have eaten here a few times, and this evening, we were seated upstairs above the beautiful gentleman playing the piano. It was our first time upstairs, and it was lovely upstairs with lots of photos and old posters of shows past to take in. I did feel we were forgotten about upstairs, which would be the only reason for giving only 4 stars on service. We had the lasagne and the chicken parmigiana both were absolutely delicious üòã  we had hoped to eat dessert also, but there was definitely no room after the generous serving sizes. I even had to take half of my parma home with me! The schnitzel was crumbed with panko crumbs, and it would have to be the most amazing crunchy schnitzel I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Highly recommend the spaghetti tree perfect for any occasion or just to grab dinner before seeing a show. But always book ahead as they do get very busy. However, if you do pop in on a whim, they can seat you at the bar to have a cocktail while you wait for a table. Big love to the spaghetti tree"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajlmSUt3EAE,"First time visiting.  Firstly the service: - was at times a little disjointed with multiple waitpersons asking same questions - little things like not offering ground pepper with mains - forgetting one item. - waiter when we enquired ‚Äúis the children‚Äôs fish battered?‚Äù, seem to diligently go to the kitchen to check, returning and advising it is not battered.  Only to have it arrived battered (which our little boy will not eat). All of these very forgivable. Secondly, food quality / quantity: We have veal / prawns and a spaghetti dish for adults, fish for little one - veal was well sized and delicious- only negative was luke warm - other mains were delicious and plentiful.  Desserts were delightful!  Overall - we would return"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajRYbmx3RRAB,Great food and friendly staff. Just as I remembered it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa1l1WWhBRRAB,What a fantastic place. The food and atmosphere were amazing as well as the live music.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGNmbHZnRRAB,"Excellent food and service as per their usual high standard, and live music being played. My go to Melbourne restaurant for any relaxed but still fancy dinner. Plus, very accommodating to the theatres nearby."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN29xZUlBEAE,"Haven't had a chance to try this restaurant before - my loss! Atmosphere great, food so yummy, and service +++ Outside seating/service available. Summation: Hungary, go in and eat to your heart's content!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaG9QaEJnEAE,"Amazing comfort food, but restaurant quality. The service is always so attentive and ask if you need to hurry your orders to make a show/theatre time. Delicious! Highly recommend! Will always go back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc29pejhRRRAB,Always been the best place to eat in the city. Everyone is friendly and kind. Great service and wonderful food that really hits the spot.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSek83Ukh3EAE,"Service amazing, generous serve but quality missed the mark"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cExhNlhnEAE,One of Melbournes iconic places to visit. It's a must do. Top of the mall always busy.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dU9DWmJ3EAE,"Coffees and bleuberry tart 'stile italiano' at Pellegrinis, Melbournes oldest (and first in the 50s) bar style cofffee shop on bourke st. Still the old italian cafe atmosphere down to the staff.  The late 'lunchers' appeared to relish their pastas!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MkpqenNRRRAB,Best coffee in Melbourne... big statement for sure on a highly subjective topic but...... you will not find a better long black
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bU9YZHR3RRAB,Gorgeous!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0tpeWFnEAE,The place and atmosphere was really nice but they don't have much vegetarian option.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLTlPVm1RRRAB,Love coming here when ever I‚Äôm in Melbourne. Absolute must for any Melbourne food tour. Always try and sit in the kitchen when I visit here. Staff are always so friendly and enjoy talking to you. Food is incredible. I love the lasagna. My go to dish when I come here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTZ6QXlRRRAB,The best coffee in town

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXFpSDZBRRAB,Such a good spot. Real authentic italian vibe. Great coffee and granita! Food is very decent. Staff is just wonderful
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSam9iNnpBRRAB,"Classic Melbourne staple.  I‚Äôve been coming here for years. This week I decided to try them in the same week during the week and weekend and document the differences.  Been here twice in the last week. The lasagna was incredible the first time I visited. (On a Tuesday night - still busy but no line) came to our bar table within 10mins  I got the rigatoni the second time (on a Saturday night, line out the door) and it was mixed with penne ‚Ä¶ so I guess you‚Äôd get rigatoni if you ordered penne too lol.  On the Saturday night they forgot our order and it also was Luke warm when it eventually arrived after 25 mins, I know not long for usual restaurants but slow for their usual service.  The toilet is out on the side at and around the back of the kitchen. Definitely don‚Äôt bother asking for anything special, what you see is what you get and it is how it is vibes.  Not wheelchair accessible unless you eat outside and don‚Äôt need to use the bathroom. This is a melb classic, worth it for a middle week corporate quick lunch or after work dinner with mates. Don‚Äôt bother on the weekends- too many tourists flocking"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXU2WWx3RRAB,The spaghetti and meatballs is one giant meatball.  I  L O V E  I T .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXVHMUtREAE,"I finally manage to dine in one of Melbourne's classic Italian restaurants which its reputation is undoubtable. Well-known with its first espresso machine in town, this place also serves variety of incredible pasta. There are not many selections of menu, however, they serve only the best. Not only the pasta, there is dessert options available.  Discuss with the staff is recommended for a first timer. They will be able to guide you with the order, which a portion of a lasagna and a portion of a spaghetti carbonara were suggested. We will be served a piece of in house made bread and butter prior to have the meals. All the pastas I have are flavourly tasty. The classic carbonara is a top notch, and the classic ragu lasagna was amazing.  It is perfectly cooked and served warm. The portion and the price are very decent. I, definitely would be delightful to come back and try other menus. Although there is a waitlist to get in, this place serves the food relatively quick."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXR5RVJnEAE,"Love this place. An iconic eatery that reminds me of when things were simple. Great pasta, cakes and coffee. Thank you, don't ever change."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXBhd3lRRRAB,"Been going here for decades, never disappoints.  I love how they're not renovating and waiting for it to come back in style.  Their pasta is the best!  Rose is their secret weapon! 10 out of 10."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXJTTWR3EAE,Great food and service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHYybWN3EAE,"Three of us came to Pellegrini‚Äôs Espresso Bar on a Friday night for dinner. We ordered the fettuccine carbonara, ravioli amatriciana and spaghetti bolognaise (pictures included) as well as the watermelon crush drink. Food was tasty, service was excellent, and vibes were bustling and vibrant. I‚Äôll be sure to stop by next time I‚Äôm in the area and craving a delicious Italian pasta. Thanks for a good time Pellegrini‚Äôs!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSak9LT1hnEAE,"A casual and warm shop~ It has a history full of feelings~ The food is simple, rough and delicious~ My husband said that he has eaten this shop for 30 years~ He regrets what happened to his grandfather when he was abroad and he couldn't come back~ He felt sadüòñ He said that he often has lunch and coffee here alone~ the grandfather is very interesting and helpful~ The customer sitting behind me brought his granddaughter to drink coffee and told the granddaughter the history of this store. The place to start helping! Really great, I like this store very much!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUx1NmxRRRAB,Great spot for some low-key pizza and drinks
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OFBHZDFBRRAB,"When I visited Australia, I went looking for a place to get a slice of pizza. Little did I know that‚Äôs not really a thing in Australia. But then I found this place‚Ä¶ AND THEY HAVE LEGIT PIZZA!!! It was seriously a small taste of home for me. If you‚Äôre looking for a slice of New York style pizza, this is the place to get one. Next time I‚Äôm in Melbourne, I‚Äôm 100% gonna head back for a slice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN09fUllREAE,"Great pizza, great bar. Well done!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjYzb29RRRAB,My mushroom pizza was kinda dry but my friend's slice of vegetarian was apparently quite good. Not bad if you're on the run.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ19ILUp3EAE,"An intriguing spot offering quite an above-average experience, but seating needs looking into in general."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2NmUjVnRRAB,"Really cool hidden bar in the back where you can order drinks and food. I had 3 slices of pizza, and really enjoyed the chorizo. The cheese and pepperoni were quite average.  Music was a bit too loud if you wanna chit chat but that‚Äôs the vibe."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOWZiNm9BRRAB,"Love love love. Best walk up slice I've had. Thin and delicious crust, quality toppings"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXBTVnN3RRAB,The person at the door that was dishing  up takeaway pizza with a large side of bad attitude on Wed 29/03 at 10.10pm had the most vulgar attitude and should rethink their suitability to work in the service industry.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX0tIWmFnEAE,"Pizza Pizza Pizza hidden bar is a cozy little spot in Melbourne that serves up delicious pizzas and drinks. The atmosphere is laid-back and intimate, with dim lighting and a speakeasy vibe. The pizzas are the star of the show here, with a range of creative toppings and crispy, thin crusts that are cooked to perfection in a wood-fired oven.  The drinks, on the other hand, are just okay. While they have a decent selection of cocktails and beers, they're not particularly memorable or outstanding. That being said, the prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and attentive.  Overall, I would recommend Pizza Pizza Pizza hidden bar for its tasty pizzas and cozy atmosphere. However, if you're looking for exceptional drinks, you may want to look elsewhere."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbzR6MWl3RRAB,"Great spot, cool vibe and good drinks. These are the only good things about this place. The staff service was absolutely abysmal, firstly we were refused a vacant booth seating despite having more people than what their couch seating could comfortably accommodate. Secondly, attempting to order further drinks was near impossible to the point where we had to approach the bar even though it‚Äôs ‚Äútable service‚Äù. Thirdly, the overall attitude of the staff could definitely use an adjustment, with a refresher course on treating paying customers."

The taste and flavor of the Snow White pizza was excellent but there just wasn‚Äôt much of it for two people to share @ $26. Salads were expensive so we skipped. If they had the same topping on the older Napoli style base it would be fantastic. Beware of the old photos as the style has changed."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleE1HMlF3EAE,"Walked around Melbourne trying to find a cosy and authentic Italian restaurant in the CBD and eventually came across this gem in Bourke Street.  The pizza and pasta dishes were delicious, wine was from Italy and perfect, and the Affogato hit the spot at the end of the meal.  The owners are extremely friendly and it was like having a meal with friends.  Highly recommend stopping by for a great meal and welcoming atmosphere.  Thank you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaWR2al93RRAB,Amazing food and first class service!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbFlXbE5BEAE,Too rude and arrogant so I left iediately
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5N0pxLTFnRRAB,Best customer service ever. Staff really knows their special wine and food. They recommended awesome chef's special and took care of food allergy too. I don't really like row beef basically but this one is the best. Open kitchen makes us excited. Desert drink called Sgroppino is the best.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3YtaFRnEAE,"Drop in no booking, no plan of what to eat. Asked for food to suit a 4( minute sit foen dinner. Popped us the bar and had beautiful rabbit ragout, a magic pizza, simple rocket salad and a divine red wine! No fuss, simple delicious good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNVBfR2hBRRAB,Awesome!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGM2UW5RRRAB,"Can't go wrong with the always delicious food and reasonably priced compared to many other Italians of this quality. Nice atmosphere, attentive staff, loved my rabbit pasta special. Others in our group had fish and lamb which were also well received. Yum."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnN6eTdBRRAB,"I walked in off the street and was treated like family by Richard (owner) and his team. Great prices for what you get as the quality here is tip top. Service is out of this world and by caring, knowledgeable folks. Will be coming back. Highly recommend!!!! Locals obviously LOVE this place and I was lucky enough to find myself, and a great meal, here!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOVlTaFpREAE,"On holiday (from Scotland) celebrating our silver wedding anniversary. Found this restaurant via Google, and we're so glad we did. It was the perfect place to celebrate. Fantastic food, excellent service, very good value, and a really great vibe. 5 stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodFotMnBRRRAB,Great food and atmosphere üëå
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodjhHOFVREAE,We dined there last night with some overseas guests and it was their choice. The food was pleasant but not special. The risotto was a little under cooked and could have had a bit more flavour. The tirimasu was only half eaten as it was lacking flavour and overdosed with cocoa. This is ok but there are better Italian restaurant with more wow for the buck.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocl9Dd1pREAE,"A little busy, but the service was amazing and the food divine."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ0xiejlnRRAB,Exceptional food !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEtlNW5RRRAB,Nothing wrong with the food and the drinks here. Very noisy. No WiFi.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemJpdzFBRRAB,"If you‚Äôre looking to taste some authentic Japanese food here in Melbourne, I highly recommend Tsuru Japaneseü§© I got to try the Tsuru Japanese Teishoku lunch set and it was amazing! For each set, you will have one of the main dishes, Seasonal Side Dishes Two-kinds + Miso Soup üíñ  For the main dish, I was able try the Wagyu Beef with Onsen Egg Don, Australian M9 Wagyu Sukiyaki, and the Tonkatsu. The wagyu is mouth watering and very tasty! The tonkatsu is very delicious too, I like that it has a bit of spicy flavour in it. For the drinks, I had Tsuru Yuzu Lemonade and Japanese Green Tea. The tsuru is very fancy!! Very refreshing.  The food and the place were amazing. Takes me back to Japanüíñ üáØüáµ  I had the best Japanese dining experience at Tsuru ‚ù§Ô∏è"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE5LUFZBEAE,Highly Recommended
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDV6NVZ3EAE,"Wanted to make a point that the food here was incredible, the steak was one of the best I've ever had. However, what really let them down was the service. They were extremely understaffed, I had waited 30 minutes for a soft drink that I had to remind staff twice about before finally receiving it. A few of the entr√©es came out after the main meals which didn't make sense. If the service was better and food came out in order, it would've been a fantastic dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScy1iWEh3EAE,"i made reservation on 10/04/2024, I booked one month ago, and the email still remind me to come, but the restaurant was closed, I was planing to celebrate my birthday from Brisbane, however, it happens to me; it totally waste my time and affect my mood, üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄreally bad experience!!!!!!!!b"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLWF1U1FnEAE,We‚Äôve tried the Omakase Set Menu with other separately ordered specialized main course. The experience was amazing from Entree to dessert. The Sashimi was nice and fresh and the wagyu was melting in my mouth. Loads of people sitting in restaurant but still got great vibes around. Recommend people who wants to hold up a business dinner or a couple goes out for dating or friends gathering and chilling out. It‚Äôs reasonably priced with amazing outcome delivered.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGEzZENnEAE,"Probably my new favourite restaurant! If you love Japanese, you have to try this place. Perfect for any occasion or just a fun meal out. Each dish is crafted with the perfect flavours and complimented by each ingredient. The highlights included the All star omakase box, wagyu fried rice and ‚Äòkagoshima wagyu toast‚Äô (with foie gras mousse, truffle and caviar). Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Highly recommend !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2ZMYVJ3EAE,"Such delicious crab and scallop chawanmushi, and the uni oysters were to die for. Pity I couldn't sample more as I was dining alone, but I will definitely be back, with company."

My sashimi set is $48, i get 6 pieces of sashimi, 1 scallop, 1 fresh oyster, 4 pieces sushi and 4 nigiri (because their fish are delivered daily you may get different from what i have today! But freshness is guranteed). I love their side dish too, its their chef speciality. You have to order the set to try it.  Wagyu Beef Don with perfect onsen egg, just break it and mix everything together. Taste a hint of sweetness from sauce and small chucks of wagyu in every spoonful, its just perfect.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejhxMkpREAE,"I recently visited a restaurant and was blown away by the quality of the dishes. The Oyster was fresh and well-seasoned, while the Somen was cooked to perfection and served cold with a refreshing dipping sauce.  The 7-kinds chef selected Sashimi was a highlight, featuring an array of fresh and flavorful fish that were expertly prepared and beautifully presented. The Nimono was also a delightful addition to the meal, warming my stomach and preparing it for the main course.  The Eel was tender and perfectly cooked, with a sweet and savory glaze, while the Foie gras was rich and decadent with a silky texture. A small glass of fruit vinegar that was sent to you by the server after the Eel was a wonderful touch to refresh your palate  The 3-kinds chef selected nigiri was expertly crafted, and the Wagyu was a standout dish with a rich and flavorful beef cooked to perfection.  The desserts were the perfect way to end the meal, with the Mandarin jelly being a refreshing and light option, while the Creme br√ªl√©e was rich and decadent with a smooth and creamy texture.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for its attention to detail, expertly prepared dishes, and warm and welcoming atmosphere. It is truly a dining experience not to be missed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoZ2Nyc0RBEAE,"Good experience, good service"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHRlb3lRRRAB,Amazing experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3NPZnBRRRAB,"I am in still in search for my absolute favourite traditional Korean dish, but the beef soup here is pretty good. I always love the array of side dishes so you don't end up wishing you had more options. The service was excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk42MHl3RRAB,Don't be mesmarised by the accompaniments. The food is so so in taste and everything including tea has a 10%surcharge which is not mentioned. Our bll which should have been $164 was $180.40. And they did not have the heating on!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajY2bmp3RRAB,Braised pollack was incresibly great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2FDNlV3EAE,Great banchan serving in Melbourne!!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEtTbGxRRRAB,Friendly staff and plenty of great food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodWFLdS1RRRAB,"Friday dinner, ordered 4 main dishes. We understand all prices went up. Portion size was ridiculously small. Staffs looked like they don‚Äôt want to work. I assumed that 2 staffs who worked front house looks like owner‚Äôs family member.  Spicy octopus was zucchini , onion plus little pieces of octopus costed almost $40.  Dak bbokeum tang‚Äôs portion was not even half of whole chicken. Chicken was too over cooked and pre- made ( maybe at least 2-3days olds).  Also, staff asked us to order more foods due to numbers of kids we have.  Anyway, we are not coming back never again. It 100% been changed their quality of foods and service compared of last time we been.  That dinner was just make my stomach full. It wasn‚Äôt good experience at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHRpU01nEAE,Update your hours on google map if you‚Äôre going to take 2-3 hr break after lunch!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWNTRDJnRRAB,"Awesome and highlights was the amount of sides, the kimchi jjiage and beef soft rice cake was bland. Was hoping the jjiage would be more pungent. Service was great. Would go back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3J1NHZBRRAB,"This was our all time favourite korean restaurant since early 2017 however over the years the taste and quality has changed and is inconsistent. It had the traditional korean restaurant taste. I have been here with friends, family my husband alone during lunch breaks as it was my favourite but it no longer tastes as good. :(  Favourites were/are(?) sseollongtang, spicy pork bulgogi, galbijim and the soy bean soup.  The last time I visited was at the end of 2022, for the mains the taste was still fine and good for korean restaurants around the area but it just wasnt as good as before. Side dishes were still good.  Would not recommend their hot pot / big soups like the spicy crab one, army soup and the stir fried octopus and pork dish. I don't think this is the restaurants strong suit.  Rating is low just because of the inconsistency and decrease in quality compared to before. It still is in my opinion, tasty for Korean food and definitely not bad but it was just SOOO much more delicious before!  I hope the restaurant can work on this because it was just really good before  Also the restaurant needs to include at least some side dishes when you order on uber eats. One time I was considering ordering delivery to save time, but uber eats did not come with any side dishes which was sad. I think it would be reasonable to include at least a few because I think the side dishes are a main highlight of this restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX3ZENVlREAE,"I‚Äôd been craving Korean food since moving out. Most Korean restaurants taste fusion-y, but this place tastes like mom‚Äôs cooking. Good price, good portions, and generous banchan."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdDh6VV9BRRAB,Not worth paying
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNjRuUWNBEAE,"We paid for $82.5 for two people set. How small is the kimchi jjigae portion? It should be included two main dishes and one soup, and this is the soup we received."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeGZhN0d3EAE,Generous and great side dishes serving‚Ä¶good service staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCX0lDR2FnEAE,"Such a great find for Korean cuisine. I wish I knew this place ways earlier. This is one of the best korean restaurants in Mel that I have ever eaten so far. We ordered set menu for 2 which was super good in value. So much food and we even forgot about the dessers :)) I only remember about it now when I am writing this review. Would be great to have the ice cream too but save it for next time then :) We had bulgogi hotpot, tofu soybean soup and spicy stir fried baby octopus and pork bulgogi + 10 side dishes. They all were great and very tasty. Enough for 3 people even. Hansang were well known for their generous side dishes and you wont be disappointed about it. Staffs were friendly and nice. Good services. 5% off cash payment. Overall, 2 damn full and happy tummies üòÇ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM01yS1JnEAE,"If you love Korean soul food and delicious banchan, this is a must go!  Had the $75 dinner for 2 people that includes a Jjigae, choice of two mains, rice and dessert. So many good main dishes to choose from. At the end, we choose the braised pork and grilled saury. Both were delicious.  The staff was lovely and the place was very clean. Would definitely come back and try fish cake soup!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc1BTZDF3RRAB,Very good Korean dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MEs3ay13RRAB,Must Try : Almond Hot Chocolate and Birds Big Brekkie
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzRqRGp3RRAB,"Great staff,  great ambience. Burger bun was a bit stale and egg white was under cooked. Home made aioli good though! Oh! Didn't have pizza (what I came in for!)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2ZxcUVREAE,Dropped in here for lunch today on the spur of a moment. Ordered chicken salad and black bean and corn salad. Absolutely the best salads we have ever eaten. Fresh and crisp ingredients with just the right amount of dressing etc. Service was  too. Would recommend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeE8yYXl3RRAB,Ordered breakfast on the 17/4 as it was next to our hotel. After 30-40 minutes we hadn‚Äôt received any food let alone any of the drinks that were ordered or even table water. It wasn‚Äôt feasible to wait that long as there was only one other small table with patrons. We asked for a refund and we‚Äôre told we would receive a phone call regarding this as no one on site is permitted to do credit requests. It‚Äôs been well over 24 hours and still haven‚Äôt received a call even after going back in to follow up. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSelBYMmlnRRAB,"i went here after my wife died, angela was kind and nice and she didnt deserve to die, for weeks prior she kept begging me to get time off and go to this cafe with her, as my job gets me out the door early and home late. she loved jazz and music, and life, but i guess god has a will.  rest in peace darling, the coffee here was good."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTVUbGNBEAE,"Amazing cafe and restaurant and bar. Delicious strong coffee. Saw some fancy cocktails whizz past me. Nice jazzy ambience to enjoy a coffee, do some work on your laptop or a relaxing spot to have brunch. The velvet lounge chairs are comfy and the booths are cool too. Staff look smart in their waistcoats and are very helpful and attentive. Very Paris."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajhMaDZ3RRAB,Brilliant Coffee here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLUpTOHFnRRAB,Really poor customer service. The staff were grumpy and made it clear that they weren‚Äôt happy to be working. I didn‚Äôt feel welcome at all. Only gave them an extra star because the coffee was pretty good. Still won‚Äôt be going back though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCamQzVVZ3EAE,"Great feed takeaway, just have to be patient and check your order if you have ordered extras."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbGZtMHN3RRAB,"Came here a couple of months ago. Coffee is meh, but the toasties are terrible for the price. The ones I make at home are better than here. Barely and cheese and just once piece of ham."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN3FpME53EAE,"A nice quiet Cafe, jazz playing in the background, friendly & accomodating staff. Meal was good. Would come back for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtc3BxN2p3RRAB,Customers are a bit of a hassle for these people
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMUw3NDdnRRAB,"This place  feels otherworldly. You step in, soft jazz meets your ears. A friendly voice perks up: ‚Äúcan I help you?‚Äù. You turn to see a desk with a small person behind it that you‚Äôd somehow completely missed. You accept her help and ask where you can place your order. She directs you to a small counter with a shiny blue espresso machine on it and twinkling wine glasses hanging above. You wait at the counter but it seems like no one is there. So you ring the tiny bell and the sound mingles with the jazz but no one comes to help. You start thinking that no one will ever come, and just at that moment a man bursts from the back room. You stumble through a slightly confusing but resoundingly polite conversation and end up with two hot chocolates in a midnight blue booth.  Time slides by as you survey the characters in the room: a man working away at his laptop in the low lights, a bright conversation behind you, and the warm brown eyes across the table.  Before you know it the piano stops and the spell breaks. It‚Äôs time to go. The cold night air snaps you back to reality but that saxophone stuck in the back of your head keeps you warm inside."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX0xlcnBBRRAB,Excellent service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldGZ2eDJBRRAB,It's a nice place to have a conversation with the atmosphere and cozy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbUp5WVRREAE,Overpriced cocktails. Took almost 20mins for two that just taste like ginger beer üôÉ *only 4 customers including us
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOE42Ri1nRRAB,Worst experience! Hot chocolate was not hot even
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzdYN1B3EAE,Went for a lunch meeting. Wish I could have read reviews before. Worst experience here. If you cannot serve vegitarian food then don't do it instead of putting a half baked awful bowl of pasta.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdFAtVjZnRRAB,Great coffee!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaExpWDNRRRAB,"Exceptional service, Talia was the most bubbly friendly young woman we had the pleasure of her serving us for the night.

Nice little place. Would definitely go back."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMTV5NE13EAE,"The worst cafe that I ever been in Melbourne before. I ordered ‚Äúice chocolate with almond milk‚Äù today. And the drinks that I get is syrup chocolate flavour mix with almond milk. Not even mix it‚Äôs just syrup and almond milk. Very very disappointed. I didn‚Äôt take the drink because I can drink it. Sooooo bad, bad experience. The women who‚Äôs work at the front (cashier) very racist might be because I‚Äôm an Asian. She doesn‚Äôt even say sorry I when tell her that I‚Äôm not gonna take the ‚Äúfake ice chocolate‚Äù (she is the person who makes that bad drink) She should let me know if she didn‚Äôt know how to make a very basic drink."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzlQSzlRRRAB,"Got the char kuay teow to go, man was i disappointed. I have had a lot of char kuay teow in my life and this is the one that tasted the least like char kuay teow. The flavours and taste were just not right, it lacked a couple essential ingredients that are a must for char kuay teow. My fried egg came in a ball. Those prawns were not fresh prawns, very obviously frozen as they were tasteless and unseasoned. Also used frozen carrots. It was soooo oily as well! I was super disappointed by this meal, my expectations were from the great ratings left from others who have visited. Never again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd2JQMFRREAE,"It‚Äôs my last day in Melbourne and I‚Äôm yearning for some Chinese food. Googled and viola, guided to the doorstep. Food wise is huge portion, coupled with the amazingly low price, definitely a 5 star. I‚Äôm happy to see my plate of sweet and sour pork had celery and carrot, whoch makes this sinful dish slightly more balanced."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMHUyOHdRRRAB,"This restaurant has been operating for 10 years already, and is an institution of West Melbourne. It is run by a courteous Cantonese couple with solid cooking skills and experience.  I ordered the Mapo Tofu. I was surprised that it came with sliced beef, rather than the usual beef mince. This shows quality. At only $13, this was a bargain.  The portions were generous, flavours were very good and the dish piping hot. Would reccomend it to anyone!  I hope we can pool together to support our local eateries who are struggling to remain operational with less people coming into the CBD."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHLXUyU0JBEAE,The meal was excellent

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaHN5dGV3EAE,Rice and noodle dishes that actually remind me of being in Asia. Authentic experience complete with 2-3 minute service and piping hot dishes that appear from nowhere. The beef rice is spectacular.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MHJEX1d3EAE,Vegetarian Mapo Tofu ü§§ Amazing and good value. $12 for a big serve with rice. Perfect amount of chilli. Yum! ‚Ä¶

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjOHZIclVnEAE,"Really like eating here and taking away. This place is run by a lovely couple who are masters in the kitchen. Delicious food, particularly like the black pepper beef but it‚Äôs all good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjbkxpdXl3RRAB,Extremely lovely people and very nice food. Very affordable and SO FAST. Took them about 3 minutes and the food was lovely. Do yourself a favor and try this place!!!!
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNzlKahAB,This cafe has been a favourite of the neighbourhood. The quality of the food is excellent and both owners are quick to notice personal preferences. I always get extra chilli and they are perfectly located just opposite Flagstaff Gardens. Delivery is always available and the chef has a terrific amount of variety at friendly prices. It is bound to become one of your favorites too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdW9hN1ZBEAE,Today i ate the lunch special sweet and sour pork on rice it was ok.... cost $12.50 with a can of drink
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMU9yR1BnEAE,Dumplings were fantastic!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzZfVUxnEAE,"Great hidden laneway Korean restaurant near flagstaff gardens. Highlight was the delicious skewers, squid pancake and creamy fried prawns ü¶ê Friendly atmosphere, great range of Soju, nice staff and looking forward to visiting again soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbEpIMjVRRRAB,"Been here a bunch of times now and the panko crumbed prawns are just fcken amazing. I really mean it! The other dishes aren't bad but thier prawns are fresh and crunchy, hats off to the chef üëå üòã.  Also the mackgeolli rice wine chestnut is my favourite üëå.  Will be coming here much more if I can get a seat as it's usually super packed now during peak periods.  Edited: new menu and more food to eat! P.s the chefs are amazing üëè ! üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb1BMRkV3EAE,one of the best korean restaurants in Melb‚ù§Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLTlIS3pRRRAB,"It's okay to try. First of all, Korean restaurants usually have small dishes. Maybe we went too late. My friend came here before and said that they gave me a lot of small dishes. After we asked for them, we gave them a small dish. Usually when we go to Korean restaurants, many small dishes are the surprise. In terms of taste, we ordered a soup, a barbecue platter, and what else was forgotten, totaling about 100$. In terms of taste, the barbecue is really ordinary, the taste is so-so, and many Chinese barbecue restaurants taste better and are cheaper. The soup is ok, the quantity is ok. All in all there are many more good Korean restaurant options, unlikely to come here often."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdjZLbHd3RRAB,Customer service don‚Äôt good and the girl staff needs more training when i go to pay than she just stay and look at my table like mean she just want us leave as soon as possible

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdEl5Um1nRRAB,Did you comparing your food with Korea food around there? What‚Äôs better or worse? I really like Korea food but I‚Äôm disappointed with the food taste.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaFB2TzR3RRAB,Very very good service attitude towards customers!!!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcE1LMVBREAE,"Actually, some of the best chicken we've had in Melbourne. Juicy, not dry and very fresh. Service is cool and got to watch honeycomb being cut fresh. It's in a quiet lane but we're happy to find it. Chang!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcDZ2WG9BRRAB,"It was so nice to be able to eat grilled chicken! The staff are so kind, especially the male manager? I think I will visit again haha ‚Äã‚ÄãThank you!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtazZiRU53EAE,"Everything was really good except the chicken, wasn't really crunchy or yummy. But everything else amazing"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOS1hUC1BRRAB,"Atmosphere was nice, but chicken was too greasy and was not a fan of the starters."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleXVQTFpnEAE,Fantastic customer service with the best Tteokbokki I have ever experienced. Definitely a go-to when looking for a cosy outing in the city of Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOVlIYW1nRRAB,Food was amazing! Thank you beautiful staff ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dTU3VzhnRRAB,Yummm! Fun and lovely staff :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ei1HMEFnEAE,"Budaejjigae restaurant recognized! The female staff was really fun and I ate 1 bottle of soju and 6 bottles... This is where alcohol gets drunk. On a rainy day, I'm going to eat makgeolli again! It was like Korean grilled chicken, but I remember that for at least a week‚Ä¶ I can't forget..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3VTZXBRRRAB,"Cozy place, and great food! Didn't get to take food pics but must order any of the Korean soup - generous serving and tasty!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcU5HdTZRRRAB,Everything was so delicious here. We ordered budae jigei and oven chicken. Which we both love it. The budae hotpot was really spicy. Perfect match with rice wine. Will definitely go again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPME56UFdBEAE,"I don't recommend this restaurant for everyone. Bad service. There was some seat inside so we asked if we can sit any of them but A korean girl said all booked. 30min later there were another customers and these unbelievable staffs let them go inside and sit inside. A girl was saying that we didn't ask for inside seat. Also hotpot wasn't cooked well. Took 1h30min for the order for only 2meals(hot pot and grilled chicken )  DO NOT GO, WORST KOREAN RESTAURANT EVER."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjlMSlpnEAE,"Never had a kimchi hotpot so bland anywhere else. Service was generally okay, but this one female staff needs more training specifically in customer service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbGMyeS1RRRAB,One of the best price to visit in Melbourne CBD. Staff are very nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MkxiUnNRRRAB,B√°nh m√¨ 5/5 Fresh 5/5 Clean 5/5 Customer service 5/5 Friendly 5/5

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmJTX2tRRRAB,"The banh mi here is amazing. The lady packed my roll with meat, super delicious. Friendly and quick service too, plus she gave me a free Kit Kat! Will definitely be back! üòã ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEkyWXpnRRAB,The best roast pork crackling banh mi I've ever had. For real.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNFo2ak5REAE,The best pork in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod195d0hnEAE,"Super tasty, massive servings, value for money! Had a pork noodle salad and beef pho, the place was flat out with 2 staff nailing it. Highly recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3VDRnZRRRAB,Their Banh Mi is off the charts. Not only is it delicious but it is significant in size. Thoroughly recommend finding your way here and grabbing one.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoenM2eXBBRRAB,"Good food, very convenient, and very kind owner :) must go if you‚Äôre studying in William Angliss."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoakwtUkJREAE,"Ordered 1x Vietnamese Pork Roll (Bahn Mi) for $11.50 from a Vietnamese mama with little-to-no-English. Added cheddar cheese for fiddy cent, plus a smashing of avo for $1. Total cost: 13 roentgen.  Outcome: a delicious pork roll that included a very generous serving of steaming, delicious slow-cooked pork. (See photo for evidence.) Was also able to dine in, which was convenient.  They also serve burgers and 10/10 I will be trying one of those next."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN29XS1V3EAE,"Pretty good Vietnamese rolls, they have lot to choose from, they also have some meals from the wok/pot and some coffee as well. Can get pertty busy around peak periods"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOF9TNF9nRRAB,They forgot my order and He came to my table to reask what was my order Well it can be happened sometimes so I was alright But the food quality was horrible The beansprout was almost rotten The taste of the soup was not good It costs $16 but I would be happy to pay $5 for this horrible food To be honest I would never gonna go to eat Pho here
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdk1LVzVBRRAB,The hype is real y‚Äôall This place has one of the best ban mi!!! To start with the baguette is crunchy as! The roast pork is literally melting in my mouth and skin so so so crunchy And look at the veggies!  It‚Äôs a phat sandwich and enough to satisfy your hunger and your senses  MUST TRY
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1akx1OHNRRRAB,"The best Vietnamese dishes in the area, must try when you can"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aU1tUmZBEAE,so good my son eat he eats like he's never eaten
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MzUtWHlRRRAB,"Lyn always provide top notch service, she really cares for her customers. The flavors from her food really shows her dedication and passion, not to mention the generous amount served up. With the current circumstance where hospitality industry are in dire stress trying to get staff, Lyn has managed to operate five days a week without fail. Those who understand the circumstances will be more than happy to wait in line for their turn. I'll be back for more as I love Lyn's Pho and banh mi a lot!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cF9YYTdRRRAB,"Expensive and bad taste, also wait like hundred and the staff there walk like a turtle gonna die."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eG9lX0pBEAE,"Best Bahn Mi in town! Superb portions and quality of their ingredients are excellent! Their chicken patte is deliciously rich and creamy, ask for an extra layer on the roll"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLS1PN0t3EAE,"Waaaaay better banh mi than Phuoc Thanh. Sorry, not sorry. Might be $2 more expensive, however its worth the flavour explosion! LOADS of meat filling, plenty of hoisin sauce and veg. Everything a banh mi should be! I wished I'd ordered another. Counting down the days until I can visit again. This was definitely the best banh mi I've had in two years, hands down. Right up there next to the little hole-in-the-wall place in Marrickville, Sydney. This place is seriously under-rated."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdUp5TUVBEAE,Great food. But suffering from a lack of wait staff. Just the two owners running around trying to keep up. Hopefully they can get someone in to help
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM0t5SExnEAE,Can only vouch for a take away B√°nh M√≠ but it was one of the best I've had. Pork was perfectly crispy and it was so flavourful. $10.50 well spent.  Edit: went back for the Pho. Just as delicious!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyODVtRl9RRRAB,Excellent and friendly service from the ladies there. Crispy pork banh mi was great too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyLXM3bVd3EAE,"Delicious Vietnamese white iced coffee and friendly service, the sandwiches and Bahn Mi smelled divine so I‚Äôll have to come back for lunch sometime"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bU9uOUhREAE,Fantastic place. Great devices and food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MEo2cDVnRRAB,Try their Matcha Latte
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdjUyNzdBRRAB,"Excellent food, really enjoyed the mushroom toast!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzRMdnNnRRAB,Great coffee in what is a dead part of the city on weekends.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDlLeFVREAE,The sausage is really big
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScDhYZmV3EAE,"Staff are friendly. The service is quick. However, the taste could be much better. The dishes are a bit bland."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzVYTXBBRRAB,"Not as good as the social media said. The menu is creative but the actual food isn‚Äôt that good. The Korea chicken burger was over cooked ,and the soft shell crabs were too greasy, crabs were not match with sauce and bread.Thanks to friendly staff,but foods are not my taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmMyWGxRRRAB,Nice place but they should make more out of their heritage as a telephone exchange. You would never know from the way it has been designed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVoya0xBEAE,Food was decent but nothing to rave nor queue over. Quick and polite service and coffees were cold. Won't rush back even with a few veggo options
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWVuY3d3RRAB,"Very popular and therefore 30min-ish queue. Service great. Coffee was good, food looked great and tasted fairly good üëç ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWViM0t3EAE,"went here this morning and maybe 7 years ago.. still delicious and consistent. waiting time not too long. we ordered ham pork bnedict & balinese pork burger. the only miss is the seasoning of the pork a little bit lacking, overall still impressed. peanutella is still good, u can ask for dairy free milk if u are lactose intolerant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanF2RklBEAE,Funky as environment! Food was delicious! Customer Service was super superb! We enjoyed it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2N6eV9BRRAB,"Tried the Pork Benedict and soft shell crab omelette and they were both delicious! Large portions. Cappuccino and mocha was nice. Iced biscoffee was deliciously thick and creamy. Tables are shared e.g. 3 of us were seated with 2 other couples on a large circular table. There's lots of seating outside but dining inside requires climbing up steps, and more steps if you need the restroom, so not quite accessible. High chair available. Service was fast despite the busyness - queued for 20mins, ordered 10 mins after being sat, and food arrived 15 mins later with drinks arriving in between. Having said that, service could use a bit of finessing: 1) One waitress spilled a drink which splashed several customers and their belongings, none of whom received an apology 2) Another waitress ruined another customer's perfectly white shirt (on their sleeve) with orange stain when cleaning out their plate without even noticing 3) They will kick you out a little bit after an hour by bringing your bill to the table (despite ordering 3 items per person, each spending more than $40), so probably go elsewhere for special Au Revoir type occasions, just come here for quick brekkies.  Surcharge 10% weekends, 15% public holiday. Does not allow split bill.  Visited on a public holiday."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3VqZFN3EAE,Like the puns
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenJTSU9nEAE,Super tasty food and worth going. The Smashed Avocado was superb and ordered Scrambled Eggs on the side (first image and the fourth image was another time I went). The Corn Fritters were yum and very flavorful. I can‚Äôt wait for next time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHV2bmJ3EAE,"Beautiful environment and vibes. I dined outside, and the waiters were extremely friendly. My highlight was the matcha items- the white chocolate matcha latte and matcha hotcakes. They were extremely rich in the matcha flavour, and would highly recommend. The only piece of feedback I would like to point out is how dense the hotcakes were. It was a little too dense for me, but the presentation was extremely well done and very instagramable. I would highly recommend the Benedict as well, and would just come back here every day in general."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHV1eGx3RRAB,"Located in a quiet street, you can get off the car directly at the door and enter the store, which is very convenient and you don't have to walk. Quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, there are outdoor seats at the door, suitable for family gatherings with children. On the tree at the door, there are one or two autumn leaves floating from time to time, which is comfortable and cozy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3YyQmVBEAE,"Host was amazing and seated us quite quickly,  despite the crowd.  Miso Pork Benedict tasted awesome !!!  I absolutely recommend Operator25, but suggest booking ahead."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3EySUJnEAE,Delicious food and beautifully presented. The staff were lovely and service was great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa3Q2Ti1BRRAB,"Great coffee, good vibes food also amazing"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb29yUE9REAE,Solid coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbU9PUXNRRRAB,"The coffee was great, as was the food.  The line at midday on a Sunday was quite long, it also rained but there were umbrellas outside to wait under."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek95cUxnEAE,It's a good place for the night
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjRyajFnRRAB,"This is one of the best Japanese spots in Melbourne. Great location next to PTV, and is the perfect spot for a group of friends or for an intimate date.  The quality of the Wagyu beef was breathtaking. The smokey flavour has us craving it and wanting to come back every day!  The seafood was very fresh and we loved our Kungpao chicken too.  We would absolutely recommend this spot if you are after authentic Japanese cuisine"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazRYTUJREAE,basic
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamZHcm1nRRAB,Had an excellent experience at Izakaya Minami. After some minor troubles with our order the owner made sure we were very well accommodated and provided excellent service to us. The food was also good and reasonably priced.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWZDWkp3EAE,Food was good and nicely priced.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3EtaGh3RRAB,"Izakaya Minami is a fantastic Japanese fusion restaurant located in the heart of Melbourne CBD. The restaurant provides high-quality dishes at affordable prices, making it an ideal spot for a casual night out or a special event with loved ones.  The ambience of the restaurant is cozy and relaxing, with just the right amount of music in the background. It's a 9/10 for us.  What we ordered: ‚≠ê Sushi Moriawase Entree (6pcs / $22) ‚≠ê‚≠ê Ika Teriyaki (grilled squid $18) ‚≠ê‚≠ê Gesso Karaage (Deep fried squid tentacles $14) ‚≠ê‚≠ê Asari Sakamushi (neck clam egg noodle soup cooked with sake $28) ‚≠ê‚≠ê The Gourmet Seafood Chawanmushi ($26) ‚≠ê Unagi Seiro ($19)  The food is a delightful combination of traditional Japanese cuisine and fusion cuisine. We highly recommend trying the Sushi Moriawase Entree (6pcs / $22) to start your meal. If you're sharing or feeling hungry, you can go for the 10pcs option. We also loved the grilled squid (Ika Teriyaki) and Deep Fried Squid Tentacles (Gesso Karaage).  For the main course, we tried Asari Sakamushi, a neck clam egg noodle soup cooked with sake. It's a great value as you get a lot of clams, and the soup is perfect for cold wintery weather. The Gourmet Seafood Chawanmushi ($26) is also worth a try, a premium take on classic Japanese egg custard.  We also tried Unagi Seiro ($19), the steamed eel, rice, and egg served in a bamboo steamer, which was decent for the price.  The staff at Izakaya Minami are lovely, and the menu is reasonably priced. We enjoyed everything we had here, and everything was well presented. Unfortunately, we didn't try the cr√®me brulee or pannacotta for dessert. Overall, we highly recommend Izakaya Minami for your next Japanese fusion dining experience in Melbourne CBD.  Overall rating: 4.5/5"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd29QTXVRRRAB,"Great food We had a variety of dishes, and each was delicious and well prepared. Unfortunately, the service was very slow for a quiet night - an easy fix"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSellfWEd3EAE,Had a very pleasant dining experience. The food was delicious! We had the sushi and sashimi selection and also the clam egg noodle soup (asari sakamushi). I recommended this egg noodle dish! It was delicious especially if you like clams. Plenty of seating as well so you don't feel boxed in. Thank for a great dining experience!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOElqaUZBEAE,Visiting from Queensland we enjoyed the food here. fresh tasty and good service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXBMM2JBEAE,"Izakaya Minami is a casual and spacious spot for Japanese dining. The a la carte menu consists of a wide variety of small plates, sashimi, sushi and main dishes. The seafood felt fresh with only the sushi rice being a slight letdown.  Favourites were the beautifully displayed fresh sashimi, tender wagyu tataki and refreshing kaisen cold soba with the grated mountain yam providing a touch of creaminess to the dashi broth! A great casual Japanese spot in the CBD.  üêü Assorted sashimi ($36) ü•© Wagyu tataki ($23) üç£ Assorted sushi main ($37) üçú Kaisen cold soba with seafood ($28)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDlLRFRREAE,This was one of this dinners where everything was outstanding.  The service was attentive (we got our own buzzer!).  The sushi was simple but very well done.  The agadashi tofu was a version with lots of unusual mushrooms.  The fish was delicately cooked and spiced.  And the seafood in custard was divine and really unusual (for us).  Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoazdXVGp3RRAB,Improved Japanese style! It is worth trying for those who prefer Japanese taste!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeFlENGFnEAE,High quality sashimi and soup. Very kindness employees thank you so much! I highly recommend!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamZ5M0pnEAE,"It used to be called Mahn Doo, a dumpling restaurant and is still on Google Maps under this name, so it can be a little confusing - it‚Äôs not a dumpling restaurant any more.  Lovely staff who were very attentive, nice looking restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. Food was amazing, lamb ribs were a standout. Good value for money. Will definitely be back."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzdUUEd3EAE,Absolutely delicious brunch down a cute hidden brick alleyway. Highly recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDlySTZBRRAB,The food is okay and the coffee is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMVpQSF9RRRAB,"Used to go to Brick Lane a lot back in 2015-2017. Tried it again but very disappointed.  Chicken salad - Their chicken salad used to be amazing, my friends and I would constantly go back for it. But now there‚Äôs less ingredients used, mainly coleslaw, chicken is salty and dry, and no dressing so no flavour..  The lamb salad - Again no flavour in the salad. Did they forget the dressing? Mostly rockets and peas. Lamb was cooked nicely though but quite salty.  Service was pretty good but I don‚Äôt know if I want to go back to try other dishes now which used to be really nice. ü•≤"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbVpfeFlREAE,"Great cafe, been to many cafes for breaky and Bricklane up there with the best, Bricklane comes with great service, food and coffee.  Ohhhhh chilli scrambled egg for breakfast it‚Äôs a knockout"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGVQaFNREAE,"Ordered food had it spilt all over me by the waitress who apologised which was fine and I was happy with that, but then was seen joking and laughing about it with other staff members which I did not appreciate. Went to pay for food and told them that I wasn‚Äôt happy that my $200 pants had now been ruined and I would like the meal to be discounted. Who I assume was the manager was rude and stated he would only cover the cost of the orange juice that I ordered‚Ä¶ when I stated it would cost me way more to get my pants dry cleaned he stated he can‚Äôt be bothered dealing with me and took the price off my meal spitefully. Disgusting customer service and attitude. Have travelled from Perth and will not ever recommend this place to anyone. Staff need training on their attitudes and customer service skills"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGREcWx3RRAB,I was so disappointed in the management response to a waitress spilling  a breakfast all over my companions pants causing them to be ruined by Stains from the food‚Ä¶. Yes it was and accident‚Ä¶.but his casual response to the ruined pant was‚Ä¶.. ‚ÄúOh I heard she was embarrassed I will refund the orange juice only.‚Äù The spillage on the pants was slow roasted lamb so the oil from the lamb tipped in his lap is what caused the oil stains. To top it off the waitress returned with a laugh to my companion with a barely wet cloth to remove the excess. I accepted she was sorry until she laughed. Further discussion with the manager ‚Ä¶. his comeback was I can‚Äôt be bothered with this I will only refund his meal after I put it to him that it wasn‚Äôt orange juice spilled he refunded his meal.. Can‚Äôt be bothered making a reasonable impression on people attending your cafe. Well I can‚Äôt be bothered ever returning or recommending your cafe to anyone either your rude and dismissive manner is a very poor example of the service Melbourne usually offers. Not even happy I have to give one star to write this review. It‚Äôs a massive zero from me . A proper response would have been ‚Ä¶‚Äù Please accept my apology on behalf of management and we would like to refund your meal and offer to pay dry cleaning ‚Äú. Common courtesy goes a long way.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenZESFNnEAE,"Great coffee, quick service, Eggs Benny and Chilli Scramble were amazing. Would 100% recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXNuVmFnEAE,"Great place to take visitors, shows a great side of Melbourne cafe culture. Good food and coffee at a reasonable price. Be patient, flexible and you‚Äôll have a great time."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHRMQURBEAE,Perfect coffee. The eggs Benedict were nice. Something was missing but I don't know what.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk1HbG9RRRAB,Nice coffee and location. It was super crowded and there was a line up for dine in. Cool staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScEtPT3dRRRAB,Can't fault. Lovely laneway brick and plant life vibes. Great food. I had a well balanced and healthy waffles with chili and eggs. Chai latte was great! Staff were welcoming and asked genuinely about the food / your day. Will be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaU5uMTdBRRAB,Great food and convenient location in CBD area. A bit crowded during brunch/lunch time  so come early if you want to avoid the wait.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOEs2NGZREAE,"Great coffee, lovely and efficient staff! Trendy space and atmosphere.  Enjoyed picking from the unique menu, would have liked to see a pancake option maybe? Would come here again :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOElUSDN3RRAB,Iconic  Melbourne laneway cafe. Great coffee and a top 5 smashed avo. Very busy so expect a short wait but the queue process is very well managed and efficient.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb01uNWdRRRAB,"Great cafe, always go here when in town for the F1. The red chilli scrambled eggs are my go to."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd05fYlB3EAE,Good place & good food. Love!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzhENlVnEAE,"Awesome lil Cafe its big and roomy ‚òïÔ∏è on the inside, there was a line but it moved fast and it's great to see happy staff with actual smiles üòÉ on there faces. Didn't try the food but I will next time, it all looked yumo. Typical Melbourne it was pouring rain üåß but I'll defo be back to brick lane..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjhyVU5BEAE,"Great food and awesome service. Order took a bit longer than expected due to a printing error in the kitchen. Whilst i was fine with this due to the fact that it was an error out of their control, they still went the extra mile and offered me a free coffee as compensation. Great place would reccomend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaF9QSXpBRRAB,Wonderful breakfast coffee was good and banana smoothey was yum. Very good size meals
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbS1ieHZBRRAB,the street is beautiful and the restaurant as well. Food is perfect for a french brunch.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ak5XaS13RRAB,Amazing food and great service in a really cool setting
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cUlUaGN3EAE,"Brunch is delicious! The coffee is also very good, with a smoother taste and high sweetness."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aVBtUXl3RRAB,Really cool spot and great ambiance. Service and food were great! Thanks guys

Will def come back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzVIUUNnEAE,"Krimper Cafe is an absolute gem tucked away in a unique, reneewed laneway in Melbourne. The old building has been beautifully restored and has a warm, inviting atmosphere that's hard to find anywhere else. The food and coffee are both fantastic - I had the eggs benedict and it was delicious! The service is also top-notch, with friendly staff who really care about their customers. Overall, I highly recommend checking out Krimper Cafe - it's a great spot for a relaxing breakfast or brunch in a truly unique setting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbDRiVWpBRRAB,"Excellent service, eggs on toast delicious, coffee great, the building so interesting"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdV9EaWx3RRAB,"I went there because it was famous, but the staff are very kind and the cafe is pretty.. but the taste is not so good.. the price is evil.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2Zydjl3RRAB,This dish that I ordered it awesome. Delicious its a good combination between waffle & crispy bacon. You can tasted sweet and savory at the same time üòç
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWFXSXlBRRAB,"Nice cafe inside cbd. Parking is a little hard, and it mostly has to be paid parking unless Sunday or some short parking is available on a street nearby. Easy to catch the tram üöä. I have visited this place multiple times. It gets quite busy on the weekend morning. If you arrive after 10, there is queue most times. The food is pretty good here. There ham and cheese croissant, eggs Benedict some of the dishes i really like. They make awesome coffee ‚òïÔ∏è. The staff are very friendly and the service is pretty good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWNpZlNBEAE,Great coffee. Chia Granola fresh fruit pudding was excellent.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOGUzZUhnEAE,"Great atmosphere, OK food.  Would I come back here? Probably not. Would I give it a thumbs up to out-of-town visitors? Yes, because the vibe feels like the essence of Melbourne.  I had the zucchini fritters, which were satisfyingly crispy. That said, the serving size was much smaller than a typical brunch and I remained hungry after the meal. I'd highly recommend that people with an appetite get a side or a drink."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2JXdll3EAE,Great place for coffee and food in CBD. Staff friendly and service with a smile.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanRPRXJnRRAB,Lined up one hour during Easter Monday ü•πü•¥ But service is really great! So as the foods üòçüòöü´∂üèª ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanRhZXlRRRAB,Great pet friendly place in the heart of the CBD. The staff was super friendly and the food was amazing as well. The coffee was excellent. Would definitely recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXZIRF93RRAB,"Food was amazing and so was the atmosphere,  I've given three stars for service because one of the waitiers took a open sugar bottle from mu daughter saying its for use not play..was very disappointed to see her doing that, I will definitely go again but would like that particular wait to work on her emotional intelligence,  my daughter is only 3"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHBUNlhREAE,"Recommend the krimper burger.. one of the best burgers I've ever had, good coffee too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdXBTRDdnRRAB,"Two of us shared a big table with two other couples, resulting in the staff mixing our orders. Very disappointed with the owner‚Äôs attitude regarding how they handled the fact that they got us the wrong order and also would have changed us extra for nothing if we didn‚Äôt check"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOUpyRHlBRRAB,"Food was nice, but need more flavour:)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXI3eHZnRRAB,Came as a group for a midweek lunch- all really enjoyed our food. Thanks!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXZ6RldnEAE,"The egg benedict beef bulgogi is my favourite. The taste is unique, this is the first time I try it and I love it. The coffee latte is also good. I love this place"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3BMY2RBEAE,"I came to this place years ago and it was amazing but now seems very pedestrian. Food is ordinary. Toast comes with a small amount of butter and jam from a jar in plastic dishes. Tea is underwhelming to say the least. Coffee is satisfactory but not great like it used to be. Service is very good though, thanks to the wait staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbklIeEhBEAE,Excellent cafe and coffee. Baristas were so friendly. Cool interior and great vibe.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWRTMC13RRAB,"Excellent Food, must visit for Steak lovers. Ambience is very welcoming and charming. Staff is extremely knowledgeable, they know what they are doing and they are talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Menu is pretty sorted, some italian classics and some twists and their prices are 100% worth it. Excellent customer service provided by Gigi, such a cheerful  face."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGNXak9nEAE,Amazing pasta! Especially the truffle pasta & seafood one. I still miss it till this day. The desserts were only ok though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjRhSHR3RRAB,"I recently dined at Pretty Boy, and it was an amazing experience! The trendy atmosphere, delicious food, and exceptional service made it a night to remember. The flavors were outstanding, the cocktails were creative, and the staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. Highly recommended for a stylish and memorable dining experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGUtSm53RRAB,Good for taste and value
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGJ2UHl3RRAB,I can't finish the food. They don't offer takeaways. Staff being very rude and indifferent. At least you need to advertise it on the menu. On my blacklist now.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeHB6STNBRRAB,"‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt seat you on the table because we‚Äôre fully booked tonight. But we can seat you at the bench.‚Äù - the restaurant is empty as hell and it remains empty as we foot the bill. The manager is absolute liar and has no respect for his customers. Food‚Äôs great, but lies about the place being fully booked. Says a lot about their work ethics don‚Äôt you think?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbktUVmxBRRAB,The best pulled pork pasta!!! Friendly staffs and 4kinds of sauce for steak ü•©. But dessert is jut so so but still not bad. I will visit again ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSckl2X0l3EAE,Delicious!!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMkt6MTNBRRAB,Excellent place for steak
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbUlMMjh3RRAB,"The food was pretty mediocre for its price. Overall satisfied except when paying the bill, they quietly used DCC to charge my card currency instead of AUD, for which a 3.6% extra fee was imposed. I noticed this before I left and tried to explain to them that I wanted to decline the imposed DCC service and just pay in the local currency. The staff kept denying about the conversion arrogantly with no patience and insisted that I was charged in AUD, even though the receipt has clearly stated so and ""a choice of currency for payment incl. AUD"" has been offered to me (which is not true)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX0xMcnZ3RRAB,"I really don‚Äôt know why this place has 4.5 stars - quite over rated. We dined there on Friday night and there‚Äôs no atmosphere. Our steaks were nice  but the squid ink pasta was below average. Whilst its sauce tasted nice, the pasta itself was totally over cooked. Their servers were friendly and helpful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaEt5TUdREAE,"Extremely limited menu, over priced, bar closed at 10pm  even if dining"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodjg3Z2l3RRAB,Food and service was fantastic. We had the Feed Me option which is highly recommended as you get to have 6 courses for $80pp. Would like to see more options on the general menu though. Accor members get 50% off food. Will definitely be back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoanV1bFFnEAE,Great food and service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoN1AtYUhnEAE,"The atmosphere was great and staff were friendly.  Food: Tasting plate: selection of deli meat and focaccia. The meat were standard, nothing fancy but the focaccia was fantastic.  Pappardelle: This was done really well and tasted great. Not too heavy with the wavy I and complimented the sauce.  Squid ink linguine with crab: the noodles were great but there were hardly and pieces of crab meat. Maybe one or two. Looking at other reviews it looks as though other people got a decent portion of crab with the pasta. The taste was great but the quantity was disappointing.  Black Angus Scotch Fillet: This was the biggest disappointment of the night. It was meant to be the highlight of the course but it was burnt. The outside was charred so that the entire steak tasted bitter and smoky. We should have sent this back.  It wasn‚Äôt very busy for a Thursday night when I visited, however the quality of the food was quite disappointing for the price and location of the establishment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd09MUVBREAE,Good ambience! Great service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNV83NWxRRRAB,"Absolutely the best food I had in Melbourne! It's an open kitchen, so it's fun to sit at the bar table and watch the chef cook! The steak is really thick but soft and delicious, and the signature pasta was so flavorful with the squid ink noodles you made and the crab meat sauce! All the other staff are kind and the atmosphere is good~ I was so satisfied with the restaurant, so I extended my stay and revisited: D"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNV83TXJRRRAB,"I sat at the bar and had a really good mealüòÉüòÉ The waiters are kind and every part is perfectüëç The signature menu is also delicious, and you can choose to feed me and make it with the food the chef serves! If you're Korean, the chef is Korean, so it's really good to sit at the bar and watch the open kitchen while listening to the explanation! Thanks to this restaurant, the image of ibis melbourne central also improved, so I decided to stay at this accommodation more! If you stay at this property, please make a reservation and visit us‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjllY093EAE,Thoroughly enjoyed our family dinner at Pretty Boy. Wonderful service and beautiful food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMi1xZmt3RRAB,"The most amazing food I have ever tasted. The service was exceptional, would definitely recommend going here!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaWR6Vl93RRAB,"We had the $80 feed me menu. The ambience was great, as was the wait staff. It was quiet enough so you could hear each other talk in conversation. The highlight surprisingly was the pasta and the canneloni dessert. The steak was also good, but as the second-last course, we were struggling to finish it. It was a great meal, and it was made even better when we found out we were eligible for a significant accor discount."

Victorian produce is the hero of every plate, with steaks aged onsite using traditional curing techniques.  The cocktails are simple - and cheap! Chefs cook your meals in a large, central open kitchen for your viewing pleasure. Being a hotel restaurant, naturally my expectations were low but they were immediately surpassed from the first dish. ü•∞  The Burrata did its thing, oozing into a fennel herb oil and mopped up with some toasted ciabatta. The Prawns are a must, my favourite dish of the night. So much meat and a delicious nduja pasta to spread. ü¶ê  The Sirloin Steak was good, it was cooked well, lots of bbq flavour coming through but a little tough. It is served with an offering of 4 different styles of mustard. They are pricey ranging from $47-$185 but unsure if it quite matches up to the level other premium Melbourne steakhouses. ü•©  The Wagyu Beef Ragu Pappardelle was quite generous and very homely. The Tiramisu had all the right flavours but would‚Äôve loved it to be a little creamier.  Everything was lovely, presented well - we really had nothing to complain about.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bFBpU25BRRAB,Tasty bingsu
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aU9DelZ3EAE,Refreshing
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamUyRUxBEAE,Scoopy gets really busy but the bingsu is always worth it. I love that they come in small sizes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGNMN3hRRRAB,Good dessert served quickly. Always like the QR code ordering system.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2VycmtRRRAB,"Delicious dessert, I recommend you if you are in  the CBD ‚úÖ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa2VpSUVREAE,"ORDERED: üç®‚Ää Royal Taro (Regular): Taro flavoured bingsu with rainbow jelly, blueberry popping pearls, tapioca pearls and taro mochi ($16.00) üç®‚Ää Honey Dewd (Regular): Honey Dew flavoured bingsu with fresh watermelon & honeydew balls and rainbow jelly ($16.00) + venue service fee ($0.54)  I paid $8.14pp, between 4 people.  REVIEW: Scoopy is my favourite bingsu place in the CBD. It doesn't hold back with its flavours, with a sweetness so addicting that it's incredibly memorable. ü•∞ The taro is my favourite. It doesn't have an overpowering sweetness, but a rich nutty coconut flavour. Your spoon somehow keeps going back in. üòµ Alternatively, if you like something more refreshing after dinner, Honeydew is the way to go. It's light, and with an abundance of watermelon and honeydew balls, it's a really nice experience.  I love bringing people here. Everyone gets so surprised by how flavoursome and delicious it is. You conveniently scan through the QR code so it's really fuss free. üì≤ You may need to put yourself on a waitlist though (through a website), if there's a lot of people waiting. When your table is available, they'll send you a text with 5 minutes to answer so you can return from your walk around the block. Sadly they've taken off the group sizes (this was really helpful information!!) and they don't provide tap water anymore. But they'll gladly bring tap water if you ask.  ü•§"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnUtbl93RRAB,Have introduced all of my friends and family to scoopy. All their options are delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd3V2TjVBRRAB,Wonderful ice-creams lots of options
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkxDZ213RRAB,"i love this place! they cater for gluten free and vegetarian i believe, which is always nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk9qNFh3EAE,"This place is kinda hidden in a quiet alley. Inside is pretty industrial look with some trendy K-pop songs. You order on QR code. Decided to try thai milk tea shaved ice on regular size which was like $15, and while the appearance is really cute (the whipped cream on the top looked like cloud), the portion is so small! You can hardly share between two people. It really made me wonder how tiny the small size is. With the shaved ice, it was more dense than say like Taiwanese one. It wasnt very sweet, in fact the thai tea flavour is bitter, so you need the whole condensed milk on the side to make it sweet. I like the mango jelly topping the most out of all the toppings on it. Overall it‚Äôs the novelty of the experience, and the appearance is unique from other shaved ice place, but it is expensive for the portion."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScExfNmZ3EAE,Honestly really really really good. I had the taro one üëå ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNlBmRXZnRRAB,"Such a unique dessert place! The Mango Bingsu was amazing - flavoursome and filling. Definitely worth a try for something new when wandering around the city and looking for a late night dessert ""different"" from the normal Australian desserts."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFAzcHRRRRAB,Our go-to Korean ice cream!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjdqdkRBEAE,Expensive but definitely worth the money
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDRtTjlBRRAB,"Soft, sweet delicious snow. Played 80s Japanese City Pop, open fairly late. Great hangout spot!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDdtajBnRRAB,These were delicious! I had the hojicha and it was a really nice blend of sweet and savoury. It was my first time trying this kind of dessert and can't wait to go back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2E2cDRnRRAB,Expect to not be acknowledged as a patron as the level of service you‚Äôll receive here. The male staff member working at approximately 8:30pm April 5 just looked at us and pretend to not see us standing around waiting to order. Took our money elsewhere. Not a great business model.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmJxUWhBRRAB,"Bloody amazing. Partner called it best dessert they've ever eaten. I had the chocolate one (something dreams?) and partner had mango. Perfection for the senses and taste buds. Only downside is it is not well signed what to do as a customer, making it hard for people with neurological or communication issues (need at least a sign out front with the QR code to join waitlist; we waited for 20 minutes in the rain behind others also clueless as to whether we'd just be let in, or had to sign up, because no one greeted us at door). Other than that fantastic venue. And so quiet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWFIYkFnEAE,"Cute space and love the variety of options with weird combos. A bit on the expensive side and wasn't a fan of the fact that they do weekend surcharge.  Tried the; üç® Matcha - can't go wrong with this, loved that it's not super icey. Didn't really enjoy the popping lychee, didn't go very well together üç® Milky Brew - not too sweet, good subtle coffee flavour. Would recommend! Can definitely go without the chocolate chunks"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3ZiRVBREAE,"Amazing! I had previously tried Bingsu and didn't like it. I'm so glad I tried this place. It was so good we came back 3 days in a row. We will miss you! Every flavour we tried was delicious. Try 1 of everything. Small is enough for 1 person, but you won't regret a regular size. Hopefully, we'll see you again in 12 months."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjdiVjhnRRAB,The early opening time means we can have a decent breakfast before bolting to the airport. Currently enjoying afternoon tea and tarts in a clean environment with friendly staff and everything to hand.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE15UENREAE,Very clean and just on the ground floor of my hotel
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSclBUNDBRRRAB,Good pastries and coffee. Excellent service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUxlM1FBEAE,"This place is open and ready to serve delicious breakfast as early as 530am. The staff was extremely pleasant, quick, and accommodating. We tried out the porterhouse steak and caesar salad, both did not disappoint. The grilled chicken included in the salad was tasty a grilled to perfection. The steak was tender, came with a small side salad, and a handful of golden chips. The gravy was perfect for both the steak and chips. The serving isn't that bad considering the price, although some may say that the food isn't as tasty as what other places would have. We have absolutely no complaints, the staff took the time to check if our food was cooked and served to our satisfaction. The place is perfect for an early bite and I would come back here any time than go to a 24 hour fast food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNlBUcnNnRRAB,"The saddest beacon and egg roll I've ever had. Nice roll, but with the smallest egg laid by a chicken. Was cut in half to spread over the roll, just charge and extra 50c and put two eggs on to cover. At least the coffee was good."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaUxydkdREAE,"Pleasantly surprised by this place which is in the foyer of the Ibis hotel where I checked into. The omelette menu is great and the coffee has a nice and fresh bite to it. The lighting is relaxing, with a good music playlist and the sunken position of the cafe against the street makes it feel cosy. A good little find, recommended."

Ordered the standard beef noodle soup since its my first visit.  Not disappointed. Soup was wholesome, full of flavour, and just the right level of saltiness. Beef was super tender. Melt-in-your-mouth type. And the shaved noodles were spot-on, exactly like those you find in mainland China.  Definitely will be back to try the other menu items"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmRuNW5BRRAB,Extremely bland soup and noodles tasted very doughie and raw. Portion sizing tiny and still struggled to finish the bowl.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmRIMVBnEAE,Nothing fancy but nothing special. Good variety and value. Taste like home cook food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXVIRUZBEAE,"Daniyeru's Detailed Review:  Customer Service 5/5 *You normally get bad service or barely existing service, but good food at your typical Chinese restaurant. Not here! Surprisingly clean, friendly and a modern fit out where you can order via QR code.  Food 5/5 *The minced pork noodle is a must have. The noodles are the absolute star here and as they describe and abbreviate the DAO meaning, it means something to the terms of hand made sliced noodle by knife. Which is exactly what you see the chef doing at the front viewing window! *The noodles are so bouncy, they take a unique forms and shape only found at DAO Noodle and due to this unique shape, texture and form you know 100% it is handmade and the quality thst is achieved through the knife method is there as soon as you take your first bite. *The minced pork and ingredients also complement the noodles in every way possible. Soft minced pork, no nasty bits or bone a nice punchy sauce. It is the #1 Chinese noodle definitely in my list in Melbourne and I will definitely make time to come back again. *  Value 5/5 *For the delicious unique handmade noodles and the price you pay for it, which is not fine dining, rather casual dining it is definitely Max score! You just cannot miss going here if you like Chinese noodles!  Atmosphere 4/5 *Modern, bright and clean. Casual vibes.  Overall *#1 Chinese noodles in Melbourne for sure with no doubt due to its unique knife slicing method. You will be a fool to miss this place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN043b2tnRRAB,"Very nice noodles, fried dumplings and side dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd0x2OGZ3EAE,"very tasty noodles very chewy Cilantro for a finishing touch Tomato scrambled eggs are a bit salty, but they are perfect when mixed with noodles The braised eggs that are added to the single order are ordinary The service is good and the environment is very clean"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGFIUFhREAE,"Delicious noodles, so fresh. Nice staff, really clean place, nice for a quick meal. Limited but very good veggie options."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLWEtdVFBEAE,"Been here twice now and it's delicious! The noodles with pork, tomato and egg are my go to."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNk9HS2hRRRAB,"Everything we ordered were good, they are very different in taste but all good. The green bean noodle is probably the leaT of three just because the noodle is kinda dry, but the great seasoning made up for if.The handmade noodle is soft and great to chew and the beef soup is not salty but definitely tasty :) Tomato mince pork / shanxi traditional noodle was best of three eventough it's also the simplest. Price is allright  Came back for lunch on 17Jan2023 and ordered shanxi traditional noodle. To my disappointment the noodle is slightly hard and the soup is darker color like its overburnt or not enough tomatoes,  taste is not great at all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMjczbHNnRRAB,"This place is fantastic. Usually get the mince and eggplant noodles, however today I tried the steamed hand cut noodles with pork belly. Very unique dish which I haven't seen elsewhere. The green chilli sauce is also a must."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOXZ2a0dBEAE,Great vibe. Chilled place. Interesting decor. Seems like the food is very fresh.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoek9UU1V3EAE,"A small but great quality place. We wanted something quick from a hotel nearby so grabbed the tomato, eggplant and pork noodles with some veg dumplings too. We took it out but only had to sit waiting for 5-10 mins, with quick and friendly service. The food itself was incredible, super yummy and fresh! Would definitely recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZzVUSkdBEAE,"Absolutely love the steamed handmade noodles. The noodles were of excellent texture - a little bit springy, a little bit firm and a whole lot of yum. The beef noodle soup blasts amazing flavours, as did the pan-fried dumplings. Good value for money too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcmRIdlVnEAE,"Yesterday was my first time here and I can say that this was probably one of my favorite noodle places in Melbourne.  Ordering was very easy and simple. You order through the QR code on your table and the food gets delivered to your table when ready.  The stirfried steamed noodle (men mian) was so unique and delicious, definitely recommend ordering. If you love tofu and tea eggs, add those as extra toppings on your noodles as well. And if you love chili, definitely go for the option of getting the extra green chili release to add to your noodle for extra fragrance.  For entr√©es, you have to get the braised beef slices, as well as the vermicelli salad with seaweed and carrots."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCenVmUUJ3EAE,"I had a great time, the service was good but it would be great if the servers introduced the food and maybe recommend something for first timers.  I'm not a  huge fan of the QR code things at times.  As a neurodivergent, they sometimes feel like a real barrier.  I understand places need them at the moment though.  If you are a first timer, I'd go for the egg & tomato mix and the pork.  Both were excellent and the super savour flavours at DXM Noodle were really satisfying.  The noodles were also excellent and it was my first tome trying this type.  Although I think I've seen similar in Vietnamese cuisine.  It's not the most comfortable place, so I don't usually hang around after my noodles.  I'm going to come back for the dumplings.  They looked incredible to he honest.  Similar to Shandong panstickers.  The food isn't overly spicy, five it a go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNXRLQW5nRRAB,"I been this restaurant many times,all good l like it"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcEt6ZFp3EAE,"So SO GOOD! at this point I‚Äôve tried everything on the menu, and none of them have let down.  My favourites are the beef noodle soup, and the tomato & egg noodles. The dumplings are a close contender with their beautiful crispy skirt though.  The noodles have a great bite to them, and the sauces and soup always taste delicious and clean (weird description for food, but it just doesn‚Äôt leave my mouth and stomach feeling strange).  The tables and environment are always neat and clean, and the service is super friendly too. Highly reccomend!  Brought many of my friends to Dao now, and they always love it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCN3BTUUF3EAE,"This small restaurant serves traditional hand cut noodles and you can get either full soup or dry / saucy style. We tried two different dry noodles, the traditional pork / egg / tomato combo and the chicken gravy. The noodles themselves are chewy and the sauces are light tasting which lends it's homely flavour. The hidden gem for us was the pickled radish, it's crunchy and pickled really well. Food - 9 Service - 9 Vibe - 8 Price - $"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMm9mUjVBRRAB,Very authentic!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX0k2czRnRRAB,"Order two dishes, beef soup noodles, and pork mince soup noodles for dinner. I like beef more than pork mince as it tastes good. The aircon is too cold for me as the outdoor temperature is 26 degree."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekplSU9BEAE,I've had it for years and it's always delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNS16anN3RRAB,"Incredibly fresh and flavoursome. Super affordable, would add to the list as one of the CBD‚Äôs best cheap eats. Friendly and attentive staff, fantastic overall!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjVic253RRAB,"Delicious dinner , very authentic flavor. Staffs are friendly"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNi1McmZBEAE,"Used to eat here multiple times a week, love their japchae. Still one of my go to spots for Korean food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXAzNzN3RRAB,"Patronised this place for years but recently they have stopped serving proper banchan, instead they only served a plate of fish cake and that was it. Super disappointing as they used to have really good banchan but now they have decided not to care about the quality of their food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNEsyM2dnRRAB,Second-time visit to Melbourne. The CJ Lunch Bar always is on my top list of place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzZhNlRREAE,Very tasty!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDdibGZnEAE,My favourite Korean restaurant. You must have spicy pork Bento and chicken bulgogi with cheese on top. Great value as well!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTRfdTV3RRAB,"Highly recommend, If you want to eat Korean food in the cityüëç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM1ltTU53EAE,Fairly big serving and the food was good. Definitely a good place to go for lunch in the city
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaE9pbVN3EAE,"Waited for 30+ mins for our uber eats order. Then it got cancelled with 0 communication. If you can't take an order 30+ mins before your stated closing time, have the basic decency to cancel the order **before** we wait for 30 whole minutes. Common sense? Not so common, clearly. </3"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGVQVjh3RRAB,"As soon as I received the pork cutlet, even with the naked eye, the fried clothes and meat were all separated, and it was burnt black. The end taste is a kind of pom-pong flavor. I doubted my eyes to the extent that I wondered if I had reheated it or how long I had kept it in the freezer... Even if I bought frozen pork cutlet and fried it at home, it wouldn't be this good.  There is no broth for watercress, but one large ice cube and a little bit of thin ice are put in, so the noodles are chewed right away like ramen without the need for scissors, probably because they have not been rinsed in cold water. The restaurant itself is unhygienic.  The female employee who looked at the counter couldn't tell what mistake she had made or whether she was eating because of her whining voice throughout the meal, or whether she came to listen to her whining voice. If the hall doesn't run smoothly like this, either increase the number of staff or retrain the staff.  Food is not basic. I know you're not doing business for Koreans, but I'm really very upset that I paid this money and ate this food. I've been to all the Korean restaurants in Melbourne, but this is the first time I've been to a place where I can't get a rating like this. Not even worth 1 star."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTZPMkVnEAE,Finally found real bibimbap in Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodzhYVGdBRRAB,"Tried their gimmari tteokboki, bibimbap,cheese chicken, kimchi fried rice, yangyum fried chicken. Portions were great let alone the taste was phenomenal. Always enjoy a good meal and a warm environment with friends and staff are extra friendly however, the only problem was they gave me so much food! I couldn‚Äôt finish the food so i packed it to work so win win! 10/10 recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod19tNm1RRRAB,"The oden I ate as a side dish is delicious. The tteokbokki is delicious, and the staff are friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodk5id1BnEAE,"Went for dinner at this Korean restaurant with three friends on Friday night. The restaurant closes at 8:30 pm, and we got there at 7:30 pm, so we decided to order just three meals to share between the four of us (plus three bowls of rice) as we thought we might be scarce on time.  It turned out to be just the right amount of food (in fact, three meals left the four of us feeling a bit stuffed). The food was served pretty quickly, too, so we had plenty of time to eat.  We ordered: Cheese Chicken Bulgogi (5/5 stars) (~$25), Yangnyeom Fried Chicken (5/5) (~$20), and some vegetarian dish, whose name I did not catch, but which came with translucent noodles (4/5) ($~20), plus the three bowls of rice. Overall, it cost us $80, which worked out to be a very reasonable $20/each.  A great find! I will definitely  visit again. Thank you CJ Lunch Bar."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMEpqSlJnEAE,I always love this place . ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejZyU3VnRRAB,The food was amazing. Customer service was amazing as well. Order through the phone and you can either pay from the phone or the counter. It's a tiny place. Have to go there a bit early or there will be a line to wait.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocTh5M1RREAE,The sanitary conditions of the restaurant are serious. Hygiene is the basis of a restaurant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOU9LVFV3EAE,Delicious food. The best Teriyaki Chicken Bento
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoN0phd25BRRAB,Affordable and reliable Korean food in an unpretentious space. Service is always friendly. I usually get the tteokbokki with noodle and the servings are very generous. It can get really crowded on a busy day as it‚Äôs a tiny restaurant which can be a bit uncomfortable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMEsyczdBRRAB,"ÏöïÍ∞úÏû• is really good, not much different from Korea"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdUtIQl9RRRAB,"This is the first place I came here 3 times~ It was 3 times during my week trip to Melbourne and it always did not disappoint us. ) The teriyaki chicken was delicious, the beef bulgogi was delicious, and the broiler sauce was great. I think I will come again if I come to Melbourne again~~ I will go back to Sydney now, but I think this place will remain in my memory forever. (Note: Budaejjige is not recommended for those who don't like the feeling. Sausage is from Australia, so it feels a bit different, and the cheese is on top, so it's a little different from Korean Budaejjigae ^^;;)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCekpmMXV3RRAB,"One of the best spots in the city for a consistent, affordable feed. Despite the name, they‚Äôre also open for dinner and their super high-value bentos are on offer all day. The tofu one includes a super generous serve prepared in a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. On the side, you get rice, salad, kimchi, an orange wedge and even a few mandu. When the weather‚Äôs nice, I recommend grabbing a seat outside as the laneway locale tends to be pretty quiet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCak1UNUd3EAE,Food was served very quickly and still tasted relatively fresh. Nice and quite part of the lane.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dk1HaXdnRRAB,Good place to punch cards!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE1pb21BRRAB,"Interesting menu and different varieties of food, excellent sesame coffee üòã must try"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3MySWhRRRAB,"This place was recommended to us on our visit. The morning we went they were not very busy, we opted for a normal smashed avo over the fancy insta-breakfasts they have. The food was fine, no better than any other city cafe. The service was average. Where is dropped from a 4 to a 2 star review is the state of the place. The main coffee area was littered with dishes, boxes, workers clothes etc. And then there is the male toilet. Probably the worst I've seen in a long time, broken, dirty, full of workers shoes, cleaning product in tubs, stank. Fix the toilet and clean up the dining area and you'll get your extra stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnYtUDVRRRAB,"Sat down & wasn‚Äôt served for ages, so left‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOG9pZHBnRRAB,Just had great coffee. Is a bit noisy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUtmVVFnEAE,I got a match latte and Double cheese chilli scramble egg! The chilli scramble egg was epic and massive!!! But the match latte wasn‚Äôt good.. It was too bland
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSelp2R2ZBEAE,"By far the worst breakfast I‚Äôve had in Melbourne for the price. 2 years ago this place was classic! The quality has gone down but not prices. Spent $70 for stale croissant in the signature croissant burger, the eggs were over cooked, stale black brioche, horrible coffee, which also wasn‚Äôt even warm when I requested for extra hot. This place used to be my go-to. Unfortunately, not anymore. Disappointment on Our Easter weekend. Definitely not worth the money I spent here today and my time, for the extremely long wait on the breakfast which we didn‚Äôt enjoy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSektXdm1nRRAB,"Recommended by a friend. Such a delightful experience!  Service was great. The lady with the blonde hair took care of my order, she was very nice welcoming & friendly.  The coffee and food was simply amazing.  Definitely coming back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0pfSldREAE,Terrific bruncher üëç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjREcnBnRRAB,"Absolutely must try, food and staff are awesome."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOS1LZThBRRAB,"Partner & I got the Chilli cheese scramble and Smashed Avo. The scramble was incredible, cheesy, creamy with the right amount of spice. I wish I had ordered it myself! The Smashed Avo (different name on menu that I can‚Äôt recall) was also nice, but no different to any other cafe- the actual avocado smash could have used a little more seasoning. Also ordered the fresh chai which was delicious and enough in the teapot to fill my cup a second time! Waitress was polite and attentive, and we were seated and served quickly as well as receiving our drinks and meals promptly. Lovely bright atmosphere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDdPQ093EAE,No fresh juices and took way to long.. Not comfortable as well
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobDQyMGVREAE,"Poor service, cold food, expensive. Never again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLTZuZG13RRAB,Waited over an hour for cold over cooked food. Asked staff to check on food and they said they would come back and never did‚Ä¶.food was not worth the wait time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODdqeHh3RRAB,I was walking with my boyfriend when we discovered the place. We were tourists. The place is beautiful and cozy and the staff was so kind with us. The food was simple perfect. It was so delicious and also the presentation of the dish was amazing. We will be there again as soon as we come back to Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMC1XMXJ3RRAB,Unique menu. Loved it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWJYLWd3RRAB,"Food was amazing, staff were lovely. Service was a little slow because they were understaffed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHVMN0lnEAE,"A clean and quaint experience. Portion sizes are good value for money.  Kitchen is efficient, taking about 12min from order to table. Food quality has some highlights, but a couple of shorts as well; poached eggs were perfect, mushrooms and hash browns were amazing, but the toast came out without butter or butter on the side, chorizo itself is very flavourful but it's cut length ways and then seared...so it dries out terribly. One half strip of bacon, although perfectly cooked, is pretty unacceptable for what is called the 'big breakfast'.  Staff are really friendly but could be slightly unattentative at times.  Coffee is definitely a highlight...one of the best cups I've had.  The double and triple shots are strong and bold, but not bitter, just brilliant.  Definitely one worth checking out and even coming back too üëçüèΩ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoM01yVmJnEAE,Great place if you want to pay $20 for a toast üòÇüòÇ. Another hipster cafe.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodU8zVlV3EAE,"Friendly and accomodating staff for a big group of us, with food that was presented nicely and tasted pretty good too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNFBXaUF3EAE,"I visited at 11am on a Sunday morning with two friends. It wasn't very full and we got a nice table. It soon filled up though. We ordered coffees, the passionfruit pancakes, and the chilli scrambled egg burger. The food came quickly and it was delicious and exactly as described on the menu. The atmosphere was nice and the place was really cute. I highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobzlMYVdBEAE,Fun food and happy staff. I had my best coffee in Melbourne at this place. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for something different. Try the signature dish if you like cheese. Very filling.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamJpRDBBRRAB,Value for money. Its the best breakfast I have ever had in Melbourne.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoamVpbVFnEAE,"The food that we ordered came very late and the sour dough bread did not taste like sourdough, plus the air conditioning unit was not working on a hot day! The staff stuffed the order twice and were so confused! I would never go there again! Not worth the money!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNksyMnlnRRAB,Nice atmosphere and if you come here at 8am on a week day you can get your pick of seats.  I actually picked a spot with a power outlet so I could do some work.  I ordered their recommended double cheese chilli acramed eggs and it is super filling and you must love cheese to eat this. The serving was generous and the cheese super full on.  It was a touch too much for me but it was very good.  The salmon Benedict and the French toast though is awesome. Coffee and chai latter is very good too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXFlU0tREAE,"Food (japchae, chicken stew, seafood pancake) was okay, not the tastiest. Service was good, food arrived soon after ordering. Price was good for quantity, although there's a 10% weekend surcharge, which we didn't know before ordering."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXVDdy1nRRAB,Its a very nice place! The food are good. Service 10/10. Highly recommend.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXZ1TWVREAE,The fried chicken is very good! Worth to try it!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdl9hcE13EAE,"The chicken feet are not too spicy, so it's good to eat~ I ate so deliciously~"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzg2dDB3RRAB,This place is great for Korean pocha food with delicious authentic dishes and decent portion sizes
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzQ2SE5nEAE,"Really enjoyable experience, the food tasted really authentic and the staff was really friendly.  I recommend the army strew, the portions are all really generous for its price.  Would come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOE9TSlVnEAE,Very good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjdPN1ZBEAE,"Good portion sizes, very nice fried chicken. The Snowing Cheese is a flavour thats harder to find at korean places but you can get that here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaGZ2dHhnRRAB,Very nice very good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaFllMC1RRRAB,Very good food and atmosphere!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbk16NmhRRRAB,Food was okay.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSck5TN3RRRRAB,The chicken is good but the english skills are pretty bad. Its annoying when you want drumsticks etc. and you get boneless. If they just have the waiters ask 'bone or boneless?' Because if I say 'bone' or 'not boneless' they think i mean boneless regardless. -_-
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEo2d3FRRRAB,"Excellent service from nice staff, Nhame, and she is so kind. I will be back for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa1BDMDBnRRAB,Great taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobi1HUkx3EAE,"The chicken is really good, but it was really sad that I couldn't drink because of the license. Make sure to eat egg rolls"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZzV6V0VBEAE,the best fried chicken ü´∂ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGNtaXdBRRAB,diy rice ball is really good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbi1QNS13RRAB,"Service - horrible and pretty much non-existent. I was made to wait for nearly 30 mins and they had other people sit earlier than I did despite them arriving later. Once I had a seat the food took an hour to arrive. Waitstaff weren‚Äôt friendly.  Price - average, what you would normally pay for a brunch in Melbourne CBD.  Food - tastes alright, not worth waiting over an hour for and portion is MINISCULE.  Just save your money and go somewhere else. White Mojo is just a few steps away and is 10000x better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbi1qOXNnRRAB,"Found this breakfast place near Melbourne central, it‚Äôs in the old space of Hardware Societe. Place was busy, but didn‚Äôt wait long for a table. We were asked if we minded being on the communal table, we said no, we ordered and were half way into coffees, when we were asked to move to make way for a bigger group. We ordered the eggs Benny, the meat was very salty but the coffee on point."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeGJDNFdREAE,Fancy tasty food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdG9heHp3RRAB,Coffee tastes burnt
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHNuSHZ3RRAB,Staff were great and very attentive; one of the waitresses kept on coming over to top up our water!  Eggs benny on waffles was pleasant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXB6WXJnRRAB,"Super busy cafe, so I thought the food would be amazing, however it was average at most. Partner and I didn't come in with a booking, so we waited about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad.  We got seated, menus were given and two empty glasses, it took about 10 minutes for them to realise we weren't given water. The seating area outside is quite narrow so it wasn't the most comfortable place to eat.  Once we ordered, it probably took about 45 minutes for our food to come out, however, it was great that the food mostly came out at the same time. I ordered the poke ball and my partner ordered the soft shell crab burger. Nothing out of this world, and not sure I'd come back for the food, considering the wait and surcharges on the weekend.  Nice place to stop over and grab a snack and drink, but I wouldn't return voluntarily."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTlXQXNnRRAB,"Make sure you book in advance for your visit or else you'll be queuing up for a while. The food and service was fantastic, absolutely relished the Eggs Benny üòã"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTlXNEZnEAE,"Super delicious! ! Value for money, coffee and meals are perfect üòç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDRIV2JBEAE,Busy caf√©. Long black wasn‚Äôt that good - too sour. Good location. Service was alright.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2FMWl93RRAB,"We sort of stumbled upon this cafe while looking for places along Hardware Street and we were very pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff were and how nice the food looked. It wasn‚Äôt until much after we left that we saw how popular this place is on socials!! I, unsurprisingly, ordered an eggs benedict and they were divine. I also ordered a matcha latte and the art on it was so so fun!! Definitely would recommend, there‚Äôs so many more things I want to try on the menu"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX2R6WlhREAE,Worst customer service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmZ6SGZ3EAE,Food was cold coffee was basically hot milk just a terrible experience

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdFpfbERBEAE,"Trip to Melbourne from ages ago - breakfast @tensquaremelbourne: good food, busy ambiance, and friendly and efficient service! . Fried chicken and cornbread waffles - onion jam, fried cauliflower and thyme infused maple syrup: good fried chicken, but the waffles were a bit on the dry side. Definitely needed the maple syrup and the onion jam. Good flavours though! . Ham hock croquettes - with seasoned greens, hollandaise and a poached egg: really tasty croquettes! Nicely done ü§§ü§§. . Drinks: - Cloud night: house made 18 hours cold brew coffee topped with vanilla sweet cold foam and orange zest - Mork hot chocolate"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWF5eEhREAE,"Great food with really nice coffee.  We had the cloud night coffee, chilli & crab scrambled eggs, ham hock croquettes, eggs benny and cappuccino.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNTZ2RTRnRRAB,Terrible taste Bad attitude from server  Why should you pay a lot For This quality?
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDRtTW1RRRAB,"The taste is okay, but the price is a bit high...but acceptable"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjZxRXBRRRAB,Potato shreds are really delicious üòã
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGFia3N3RRAB,"Ridiculous expensive and everything tastes the same. We paid $160 for the things in the pics, and the two pots taste the same. The most famous chicken tastes fine but so hard, the dough is good but too thing, no crest at all. The pork intestine and duck jelly tasted just like vinegar and the same base with the chicken. The lotus root is dry as, not crispy outside or juicy inside. In a word, Xiaohongshu is all fake, run away Ridiculously expensive and all taste the same at the bottom of the pot. We spent 160 knives on the things in the picture. The most famous ground pot chicken tastes good, but the chicken nuggets can‚Äôt be chewed. The pot is as sour and sticky as the Hu spicy soup, which is not the same as the picture, and the soup base is actually the same as the ground pot chicken. The lotus root box is dry, not crispy on the outside and not juicy on the inside, which is totally different from domestic ones. 160 Why don't I go eat hot pot?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2I2VlRnEAE,"The food tastes good, but it's too expensive, it's not worth it. Two people spent 130 dollars and they ordered home-cooked dishes. I didn't make a reservation for the iron pot (I didn't know that I had to make a reservation for the first time), so I didn't eat it. No comments . But it is not recommended to simply eat home-cooked food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbTdueEJnEAE,"I don‚Äôt know if the food is good or not. After all, I don‚Äôt have the qualifications to eat such a noble meal. ü§≠ At 1.05, I called and asked if we would be open in ten minutes or so, and I answered that the door was still open, and then told me that it was about 20 minutes after the car was parked. closed. . . Can't tmd let me know over the phone? Besides, is it just 10 minutes away? . . After parking the car, I rushed all the way to have a closed door. Boss, you are awesome ü§≠"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZ2NMVGZ3EAE,"We went to Da Tieniu at 8:10, just because we were walking in and there was no booking, and after we were received, we had already placed an order and after a while, the waiter drove us away? ? ? The reason given was that suddenly there was a cooking master named Yang? Suddenly? ? ? Suddenly? ? ? Let the customers order the dishes and then drive them away. No restaurant can do it, right? But today, Big Tieniu did it. You need to communicate with your chefs in advance about issues such as whether the chefs can‚Äôt cook, instead of welcoming people in, the guests are ready to eat immediately and then drive the guests away. . It's not that there is any problem with the dishes in his house, and he will not accept any reason to drive away the guests directly! ! ! It's really the first time I have encountered such a bad experience, and it's also the first time I've given a bad review! ! !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMl9hV2RREAE,"It's really amazing, it can be said that it is the cafeteria of Mexican college students. It‚Äôs hard to find such an authentic taste outside üò≠üëçüëç"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbThfcS1BRRAB,delicious üòã
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbTVmQ1dREAE,Must come to eat fried chicken! ! Huge delicious! Amway has many friends! Portions are huge! The attitude of the lady at the front desk is also good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbTVmZ2ZBEAE,"The food is very authentic, it is Xuzhou flavor, the young lady is very attentive, I will come again next time"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbThlRXdnRRAB,"The attitude is very good, the waiter is very polite, not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbTZHUGVREAE,rubbish service sick waiter with face like i owe her
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMl9IaVBnEAE,"I booked the location and dishes for the evening of the 20th four or five days in advance, but it didn't open when I went today? ? ? ? ? No one notified me that today's appointment was cancelled, which opened my eyes to the truth."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlODdLUHdnRRAB,"Garbage service, 35 minutes after ordering, tell me that the kitchen is too busy to cook, you can change the dishes or wait another 30 minutes"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZ19tM1RnEAE,niubi
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlclByYjFBRRAB,"I heard that the taste has always been good, but I hope you will spend more time on the training of the front desk staff. I ordered two takeaways. The first time I called and said it was out of stock, which is understandable. The second time I called and said that a dish was not available. Now, can you change it to something else, and an hour later, you told me that both dishes are gone, and you will be paralyzed by eating it? Waste more than 1 hour, tell me earlier to change to another point."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleEp6am1RRRAB,"Very low cost performance, 5 people can't stuff 200 yuan between their teeth"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTcyVkxBEAE,Very expensive for something that is not so impressive... Will not go back again...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dmNEc19RRRAB,"Recommended by Xuzhou friends, it‚Äôs really good. Must-order dishes: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ground Pot Chicken $88 The Ground Pot Goose in our store is not recommended because it is too expensive... I didn't know it was so expensive when I paid the bill at $188, add noodles! Extra noodles! 2Ô∏è‚É£Potato shreds! very mother taste 3Ô∏è‚É£Salted Egg Butter Sticks with Clams"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd0liZjR3RRAB,"The big goose stewed in an iron pot is quite ordinary, but the stir-fried vegetables are very spicy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydTZlcF9nRRAB,"Went with some friends and they ordered a hotpot with chicken and pancakes on top, some veggies to put in hotpot and spam. Place looks nice & modern, beware that there is no English on the plank outside, all in Chinese. Also got fried noodles which was very nice & tasty. Hotpot was very tasty too, soup was thick that when it cooled down it became jelly like. Chicken pieces and pancakes or anything you eat with the soup is very nice because soup is so tasty. Their sugar free peach drink was very nice too. Overall very good experience. We ordered too much for 4 people, next time I would say a hotpot+ 3 vegs + noodles is plenty for 4."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3RyZERnEAE,Over priced
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteDhMeF93RRAB,"As a native of Xuzhou, I can only say that the taste of this dish is really good, the boss is also very handsome, and the proprietress is also enthusiastic. The food is a little pricey, but the portion is sufficient. It's delicious, and each dish has a lot of weight. To be honest, it's more than the North Jiangsu ground pot chicken in a music restaurant. It's just perfect!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdWVER2RnEAE,"came here for the stewed goose and stewed chicken. added a duck blood and pork intestines dish. they were all excellent, especially the flat pancake È•ºÂ≠ê that came with the stewed chicken. so good we had to have a second serve. they're not exactly cheap though, the stewed chicken used to be under 40, now it's near 90, the stewed goose pot was about 190, but goose isn't exactly a cheap ingredient. also another drawback - they don't have their alcohol licensing yet so no beers or byo atm, which is a bit unfortunate because the food they serve would go so well with an ice cold beer.  all in all, price aside, really delicious food. will return when they have their alcohol license sorted."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdHVYYWxBRRAB,"I called the SB store in advance to ask if the door would be open, she said it would be open, and then I asked if I would like to make a reservation, and told me that there is no arrangement now, and I will just accept the walk-in. I arrived at the store before 5:30. If the store is not full, I was told that other seats are fully booked. You have to wait for walk-in. I asked how long the wait was. Answer: I don‚Äôt know. Go out of business now."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd0xpeHJnRRAB,"The special Chinese food is freshly cooked so the waiting time is a bit long, but it is worth the wait and it tastes good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTdQOTdRRRAB,One of our favorite places. Food is amazing. Customer service is great. And good vibes üòâ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjQtM3VnRRAB,"Chicken feet, egg rolls, rice balls, and budae stew are delicious. Everything is good except for the fact that the space is small and you can hardly eat without a reservation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWNIS3ZBRRAB,"The attitude of the waiter is terrible, as if the boss owed him wages!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUx1Snd3RRAB,I don‚Äòt think the spicy chicken feet is as delicious as what people described in the social media.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0pLdjRBRRAB,Little hidden gem with a unique vibe & food menu that‚Äôs usually paired with alcohol in Korea :) it was good to find a place selling braised monk fish. Was sad to see omelettes taken out of the menu! That was excellent.. the food portion size is very generous
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd1lPMS1BRRAB,Very good food! The boneless chicken feets with riceball is definitely my favourite among Korean restaurants in Melbourne. Looking forward for the next visit to try more food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSck9Dd1R3EAE,"The waitress made accommodation for us eventhough the place was packed. Orders were taken via QR code and was delivered promptly. Enjoyed the food, especially the signature egg dish and the seafood tofu soup."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODdtcUZnEAE,"The foods are not bad but I‚Äôm very disappointed at the service. When I had questions about our order and put my hand up, there‚Äôs a lady working there had seen me for 3 times and we had made eye contacts, she ignored me and kept on working on her things in the reception when no customer was there. It‚Äôs also not only me, I had seen at least 3 other tables tried to talk to her and put their hands up, she just ignored and at the end we all had to walk to her and ask. Then when we were having our dinner, she just came here without any thing and turned off the fire of our stew, and used very cool attitude say ‚Äòyou can eat it now‚Äô while walking away. I couldn‚Äôt even hear the last few words as she JUST WALKED AWAY with the attitude that made me and my friend felt uncomfortable. Things happened again later, when we were about to finish, and my friend and I were still having our chopsticks in the dish to get things put in the take away box, she just came and and said ‚Äòall finished?‚Äô Then took it away. We were a bit shocked and again felt uncomfortable. When we were leaving, I heard she was asking the new customer who just came in and said ‚Äòhow many people‚Äô in a very cool tone without greeting while those customers had greet her nicely. Then she just replied as ‚Äòno seat‚Äô in return. My friend and I just felt disappointed and not enjoying the services we had experienced, the attitude made me feel not enjoy our dinner either. May not want to visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobGRpSnZBRRAB,This is the best restaurant ever. The all employees are so nice including handsome boss.

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUxrdRAB,We just dropped by without booking while searching for a Korean BBQ and it was not crowded. The staff were friendly and helpful. The Watermelon rice wine was so delicious. We had a fun time eating delicious food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjR2djdnRRAB,"The best part was that, unlike many other Korean restaurants, they use a real charcoal, was bit smoky, but more flavor, the taste is completely different. The quality of Wagyu set was top notch. I recommend you try Spicy Cold Noodle too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1p5NW5nRRAB,"This is the first Korean restaurant I've tried, the atmosphere is cozy, the lighting is good, and the taste is much better than what I expected.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobjRLb09nEAE,Friendly and attentive staff and good food. A fun experience as food is cooked over hot coals placed at the centre of your table. Pork belly was very good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDl2WnJnRRAB,"Very nice to do, bbq at your table, food is very good and staff very friendly. And only thing that could be improved is the choice of music, this was pop music and very loud. A shame because that doesn't really fit the atmosphere of the restaurant."

We ordered the pork (2pp) set kbbq as well as the kimchi pancake, korean fried chicken and teobokki to share across 3 people. Definately too much food, would have skipped out on the teobokki next time.  The pork set kbbq was delicious, the staff cooked it for us on the table beside and cut everything up and served it ~ amazing service!  They also made sure we were comfortable under the aircon cause it was a hot day so really appreciate that! Thank you ‚ù§‚ù§ water was also consistently topped up and the food came out at perfect timings.  The kbbq and fried chicken was delicious! Spot on, so were the side dishes! The kimchi pancake was a little thick to my liking but it was so stuffed with goodies that it still tasted good! The teobokki was super spicy lol, I had to take it home and add more veggies and rice cakes to it to tone down the spice but super delish!  Thanks to all the staff for the amazing service! I'll be back again!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚ù§‚ù§"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXEydzJ3RRAB,Authentic Sichuan food. Very nice!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXJfcHFRRRAB,"Excellent restaurant. When I moved to Melbourne in 2021, I lived nearby. At that time, due to the epidemic, there were few people in the restaurant, but the service attitude of the proprietress was very good. In the future, whether it is takeaway or dine-in, the ancient lamb chops will become a must, because it is so delicious. I came to dine-in again after two years, and found that the service is still very good. The proprietress and the staff worried that we had waited too long and sent oranges. This restaurant definitely deserves a higher rating."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodklXdWhnRRAB,The best Hunan Flavor in Melbourne!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLU52c0V3EAE,"After waiting for more than 40 minutes, the food was not served, and then I asked the front desk. A waiter said that another person has been dumping our dishes to other tables... Does the waiter have any grudges against us? ? ? The boss really found a good employee! üò°"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLU5QTU5BEAE,"Food delivery is extremely slow, waited for 40 minutes and nothing"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocC1heVhREAE,"According to the staff, 1. The normal waiting time for a 4 dishes order can last more than an hour, with the first dish coming in more than 30 mins. 2. If you order steam meat ball, don't get fooled by their photo showing there are 8 of them for one dish on the menu, there are only 3. I am expecting a full dish with even higher price but the three meat balls shouldn't be called and served as a dish all along. 3. The century egg with green capsicum is made by the front serving staff rather than the kitchen, hmm... interesting. 4. Average spending is more than 50$ and you can't even fill your stomach for that price. 5. It's ""usually normal"" taking more than an hour to prepare after the order. Wait what? You want to return the dish(es) that haven't been served? No.... that's ""against their policy"".  This is the one of the worst experience I had dinning in a restaurant in Melbourne"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoa2RudGlRRRAB,"It took more than two hours from order to pick up. An hour later than expected. I just went to the store and the clerk said it would be good to wait another ten minutes, but I just stood there and waited for an hour. No respect for guests' time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLVBUZjlRRRAB,"Waiting for an hour and ten minutes after placing an order on the food delivery software? The last time I chose self-pickup, I waited for an hour to go to the store and said it was not ready yet?

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeGZLMkNnEAE,"One of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Melb CBD. They serve awesome fishes in authentic Hunan-style spices; love their chewy white rice and the variety of spicy dishes. Occasionally, they will host comedy shows and birthday parties in the event space @ 2nd floor. Can't complain."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaGE2czB3RRAB,"Melbourne‚Äôs super delicious Hunan cuisine, the hot and sour chicken gizzards become more delicious, and the fried pork can‚Äôt stop. I often go downstairs to eat noodles. Melbourne‚Äôs small canteen, the pig‚Äôs trotters are also soft and delicious, highly recommended! !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2F1S2d3RRAB,"Waited too long, I waited for two hours to order"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc2ZHR2JREAE,Severed understaffed. Waited for two hrs and food is still not ready. Shouldn't have accepted order if can't deliver in reasonable time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMFpYYWZBEAE,"The boss is reluctant to hire people, the waiters are overwhelmed, the service quality is appalling, but it's not the waiters' fault."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbnR1U0t3EAE,"Food was bland, service quite rude."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOXVXNmxRRRAB,"Ordered a steamed whole fish, waited 1.5 hours, and they gave us only the head."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjVMZTF3RRAB,Tastes good but portions are a bit small for the price
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMWZ6cHpBRRAB,The service attitude is super good. I came here for dinner. It was my birthday. The staff here are very friendly. They took pictures of us and gave us candles. They are really super nice and handsome. Very cute. The staff here are great and worth coming!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaGJ6TVBBEAE,"Wowee. Some really amazing food. The noodles with the sliced beef, egg, pickled beans and peanuts were delicious and the noodles were perfectly chewy and soaked up the sauce to make them unbelievable and left you wanting more after each mouthful. The steamed egg with lobster was so light and fluffy it really was a taste sensation and is a must when you come here. By far the standout though is the pork belly bao buns. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the flavour of the pork explodes in your mouth. The bao buns are so light and fluffy it was like biting into a cloud. The braised pork belly was slightly overcooked with the pork coming through a  bit dry but the ""fatty"" part was tender and tasty. While the service is a bit hit and miss the food does speak for itself and is certainly worth the visit. I'll be back next time I go the the cbd."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaFpqQlJBEAE,"Popped in here for a quick and easy meal. The staff recommended noodles which were amazing. Soft and the noodles soaked the sauce up, making them extra succulent. Be sure to grab the pork belly with the buns or you'll regret it if the adjacent table gobbles it down next to you.  I hope this restaurant kicks off... Some nice dishes on offer here!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMGZ1U0tBEAE,"It is recommended that you do not come to this store, personally do not recommend itüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª! ! ! ! ! , I was very angry after waiting for a long time after placing an orderüí¢! !

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNXZXMjdRRRAB,The fatty sausage and fried pork in this shop are absolutely amazing. They are so delicious. I really recommend their dishes. It is the best Hunan cuisine I have eaten in Melbourne so far! ! ! !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ek1EUmtBRRAB,Worst place for food Order momo and manchurian And taste was horrible Please save your money and time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDk3LXRRRRAB,Masala chai ‚òïÔ∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczlDZHhnRRAB,First Nepali food in Melbourne and the food was very awful and the quality was really terrible üò´
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSby1EOGN3EAE,"This is a very special, unique place where everyone feels like a part of the family. Truly wonderful food, fantastic  music choices, great ambience, very friendly and fun staff, hard workers in the kitchen with excellent food. Me and my friends repeatedly always go there cause it‚Äôs refreshing for us and a lot of fun since everyone is so welcoming. PS- If you feel like you‚Äôre missing homely Nepalese food CHILLI EVEREST is the place üôèüèæ"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzh5M2hRRRAB,"I had thali here, it was super amazing. THE PORTION WAS BIGG, LOVED IT. SUPER HOT TASTY AND BEST THALI I HAD IN MELBOURNE..  Review by Kat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd19pVGZnEAE,"We had momo and sekuwa which were very good. The laphing we had was terrible. I usually eat laphing wherever available and never had this bad before. The laphing itself was very thick and tasteless, tofu tasted very weird. The jhol part was not bad though. Might try with change of Laphing receipe or suppliers if there is any. First time had dinner and Overall a fine dinner experience except Laphing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2RDVjhnRRAB,Used to be Nepali taste but now it doesn‚Äôt taste nepali‚Ä¶ jhol momo was like a veg curry no flavour of momo and laphing was not even laphing.. it was filled with bread pieces and the laphing wrap was thick as roti.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMTdQZ3NRRRAB,"Have been coming here for many years now. Best chow mein in Melbourne, service from Prakash was amazing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXRhUGF3EAE,"Weather was ü•∂ so we went there for lunch and we had jhol buff Momo, it was delicious üòã highly recommend ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTRpU1N3EAE,Best veggie Laphing i ever had and Manchurian with gravy is at another level good place to go with family and friends
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMF9xZDhnRRAB,Had a good experience having a food and specially the staff out there were so much friendly. I recommend their tea as special which got actual Nepalese Tea taste and other food were also amazing. Will love to visit again. ü•∞
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMF9LSTlnRRAB,The expectation was high but the reality is disgusting. Had ordered MOMOs take away but momos was uncooked inside. Aachar was tasteless no taste at all.ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa292STNnRRAB,Fried rice felt like a oil rice and chicken momo was like a tissue momo. The standard has been decreasing a lot . Would be better  of improving the food rather than adding a branch .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUtiYVF3EAE,When I went there floor in that restaurant is very dirty with old receipt and a bit garbage. Whereas food is good not bad price is fair not expensive. Shop is good location easy to go.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFptUmd3RRAB,Got good deal but took long time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenEyZF9RRRAB,I didn‚Äôt have any expectations about Domino but the pepperoni pizza was so good so so so so good it is the best pizza I‚Äôve ever had in Melbourne yummy yummy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHZuU2JnEAE,Good value
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOUthRUV3EAE,"Thin pizza was good ,not oily and fresh"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk5mN3FRRRAB,Inefficient. I understand the store was busy but there was no sense of urgency from the staff. People were standing around talking meanwhile pizzas were piling up at the end of the oven conveyor belt resulted in poor quality and overcooked food. In addition to this my order sat for minutes without my name being called and my name was removed from the screen without notice. I have worked in a busy pizza shop before so I try to have a level of understanding and compassion but it was clear to me that staff need some serious training!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE0zeU5nEAE,"Placed an order from the Uber Eats delivery app. The app told me the order was still in preparation and then suddenly showed as completed (did not show the delivery was in transit).  I tried calling the restaurant five times and no one picked up the phone even once.  I'm in a low cell reception area so I rely on the app to inform me, which hasn't been an issue in the past."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLXEyblpREAE,"I used to work here and broke my femur falling off their poorly maintained e-bike with worn tires. The store is also very dirty in general which says a lot about the management of this store. They also took 3 weeks to put me on the payroll after I reminded the manager like 3 times and it wasn‚Äôt until I called head office that they did. Another rider broke his wrist the day after me. And no apology for any of this either. Management can‚Äôt take responsibility for their mistakes. It‚Äôs shocking that this store is run by the same franchisees today. One of the franchisees (Dilpreet) also hung up on me in the middle of a conversation.  I picked up a pizza from here earlier in the year (after I quit) and the service had actually gotten worse, they cut the pizza with a blunt blade, the pieces were inseparable. Only one person working in the store at this time by the way. If you‚Äôre looking for good service try a suburban Domino‚Äôs. Avoid this store, Flinders St and South Melbourne Domino‚Äôs at all costs (all the same franchisee) - though corporate should be held accountable just as much.  No training was given either. Every night the backlog of delivery orders was so big it was unbelievable, which was partly a result of poor organisation.  Edit: Domino's have replied to this review saying 'sorry' and 'help us to investigate'...yeah you already said this a year ago when I reached out to you...if you guys actually did investigate, why are you asking to do it again? Lol"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM19IRmh3RRAB,No seats
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMl9Ibzd3RRAB,Consistent and reliable. Never had a problem here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjl6TWxBRRAB,"Wrong order, couldn't eat it as clearly don't read the edit's and get the order correct. Tried to ring store a thousand times and they never answered. Uncontactable for compensation. Pathetic. Terrible service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX01laFZREAE,"Small and quaint store but the food is okay. Update: Went a second time, my pizza was very burnt on the edges and it was barely a circle but the garlic bread and wings were good. The Carlton branch up northwest is better.  Seems to have very little staff. I arrived for a pickup order and had to wait 7 minutes at the counter because they were busy in the kitchen. Aside from that, the payment/pickup process was efficient; my order was ready for me on time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3YyMm1RRRAB,"The service we got here tonight was absolutely appalling. We ordered 2 pizzas at 11:33pm and received email confirmation that it was cooking. Delivery ETA was 12:07am. I got a call at 12:15am saying they were cancelling my order as they are closed and I will be refunded in 3 days. I explained we have waited 40 mins (and now everything else is closed and we are starving) for the order and that we received confirmation and they were open when the order went in. Why did it accept the order and take my money? He just said it's a system error. Not once did he apologise and he was super rude the entire time. I then asked if we will receive a voucher or anything for THEIR mistake, he said nope sorry. I asked his name and said I'll be leaving a poor review on the service and his rudeness, he then hung up instantly and wouldn't answer.  Absolutely disgusting service and behaviour from this employee, when we ordered and paid etc on time (27 mins before closing and we are a 2 min drive from there for delivery). Do not recommend, go anywhere else üò°üò°"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoejhmWVhnEAE,10.30 PM try to call for pickup but no anyone receive call then I come to store for Oder Unprofessional staff just talking each other  Not attend costumer service even I am only customer in store  After get oder worst cooking and unhygienic & very bad experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocWRUcGt3RRAB,Couldn‚Äôt recognize address in its own ordering system then had to order Uber eat. Waited half an hour then the driver didn‚Äôt deliver and left with no pizza. Dominos will not survive long with this kind of system and service. Totally not realisable. Better choose other pizza.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ29hcjl3RRAB,"Was here at 12:30am today, floor was disgusting, guy was walking around on his phone around the oven, cutting things sloppily and boxing them, then wandering around on his phone again. Place used to be good 2 years ago, but lack of good management deteriorated the food quality. C'mon guys, you're in the heart of the CBD, please show class"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNlBUZmpRRRAB,Phone just rings.... No answer
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwLXV5Wkt3EAE,"Worst dominos store melbourne, very dirty atmosphere and bins over flowed. Not clean for hours. Staff dont care about customers and keep continue their works also rude on customers. Surely skip that store on future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE1lazFnRRAB,"Good quality food and ""authentic style"" of restaurant. However, we were seated at a table near the sliding door and each time it was opened cold air came into the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDRxUVpBEAE,Great food for Decades! Always enjoyed dining here and the service!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMl9tWU5REAE,"Cute restaurant with lovely staffs. The food however was not worth the price. I paid $40+ for a calamari and it was mediocre.  There were rats in the restaurant. It‚Äôs kind of gross, they were running around the floor of the dining area. It‚Äôs a bit upsetting because if you‚Äôre paying premium price for the food, you‚Äôd expect the whole restaurant to be very hygienic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmIySDdRRRAB,"The food was awesome, the service was fantastic and the best thing was also no queue. The Saganaki is awesome, the souvlaki are delicious and the loukoumades are totally yummy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScmVUYnN3RRAB,Absolutely beautiful
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGQtdktnEAE,Good traditional greek! Food was so tasty end everyone working there was very friendly!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3RtVnZBRRAB,"We booked a table here for 11 people for a bachelorette party. When our table started to order our food we were told that we weren't allowed to order from the regular menu. Instead our table was told that each of us WOULD be paying $70 each for a set banquet.  At no stage in the 5 weeks prior did they ever mention that we would be forced to have the banquet, despite me being in contact with them a few times in the weeks preceding to discuss the event. When we told them that we had not been informed that we only had the set banquet as an option and we had expected to order from the regular menu as we had food intolerances we were told (at least politely) that the banquet was all that would be given to us. If we thought that we might have been able to get a table for 11 elsewhere on a Thursday night at 7.30pm then we would have just left.  On top of that the service was slow, the drinks took over 20 minutes to arrive (just soft drinks and beer/cider), we did have one server who was trying her absolute best but it was unfortunately not enough to make up for the disorganisation of the majority of the staff.  So essentially this restaurant ruined the bachelorette dinner because they couldn't be bothered to inform us prior to actually sitting down to dinner that we weren't going to be forced to pay $70 to get food that none of us would have ordered if we had a choice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaHU3ak1BEAE,"Ordered lots of small plates, yummy! Very busy little place, advised to book. Food came out quick"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN0tIcjJBRRAB,Tasty food and good hospitality by Sara. We ordered - Crusty Bread - Pita Bread - Zucchini Keftethes - Combination - Mixed Souvlaki - Beer  The Mixed Souvlaki was served with Chicken and Lamb. The Lamb meat was bit chewy but well smoked.  We liked Zucchini Keftethes and Combination.  We as a tourist liked this place. Bit pricey.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEpYakF3EAE,Best in town.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb01DVTl3RRAB,"Delicious, authentic Greek feast. Homely, cosy restaurant with nice service. Definitely recommend"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNlpDOVBREAE,Superb..thank you.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDZuTGZ3EAE,My favourite Greek Restaurant in Melbourne.  Never lets me down. The best food in town
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjRLbjJ3RRAB,"The sharing plate as starters was amazing.  Moussaka amazing, lamb delicious and the Dolmades perfect!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGE2dkNREAE,One of the best Greek restaurants I‚Äôve been too. I felt like I was eating back in my village in Greece. Very traditional and tasty thank you Tsindos :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGZxakpREAE,Amazing food and amazing service. Would highly recommended!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWJfNE1nEAE,"Went in with a company of four last night for the first time. Food was good, however there was what appeared to be a South Asian server who kept touching one of my female friends on the shoulder: that was highly inappropriate. That same friend soon ordered a glass of warm water and he brought 4 instead, and then later when passing by stopped and questioned her if she was going to drink it all: and when she said it was too much he looked he had a look of  annoyance. He also rudely prodded my other female friend to hurry her in to sit down and order when she first got into the restaurant. Lastly that same friend, later in the evening, needed the bathroom. She went into the restaurant again and asked that same guy and he smiled and told her to head upstairs. As she was passing behind him I watched as his face changed to a mocking one, rolling his eyes in her direction as she headed upstairs. This man has no business working in a restaurant or neqr customers. Not making this up. I'm happy to relay this to the owner if they get in contact."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenNtbkpnEAE,"Authentic Greek cuisine, everything is very delicious, but the prices are pretty high as for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSanY2ZzFBRRAB,"Fresh, fast and friendly. Proper, old school Greek food, with respectful, professional and prompt service. Very tasty and filling, noms."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSanNiNnBnRRAB,Excellent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ck1TQVNREAE,Wow what a fantastic meal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ektLbzVRRRAB,Busy restaurant with good food and a great atmosphere.  Great customer service particulaly by the older gentleman who was very friendly and welcoming.  Love the Stalactites ceiling too....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ak5yYmdnRRAB,"There seems to be a line outside every night. They only take reservations for groups of 6+, all others are walk-ins. The food and wine was delicious. I ordered the mixed gyro platter. The only downside was that I wanted another dish, and the waitress said it would take 30 minutes to prepare and she can't do that because they were busy.. i think it was because i was occupying a table they could have fit two people at. Other than that the staff was friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bEpMYnV3RRAB,"The beautiful Greek tastes and once awesome Hellenic dining experience has disappeared with the chefs and restaurant staff predominantly Indian heritage. The lamb Yeeros burned, chips not worth completing and overpriced. Won‚Äôt be returning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cE15aVNnEAE,"Returned here after 5 or 6 years.  Previously had a very poor experience with a Christmas function upstairs where they crammed us into a shared space.  Then had a souvlaki that was very fatty.  However decided to give them another go.  And very surprised!  It is a Wednesday night and every table is full so we had to wait about 10 minutes for our seats.  I only a generous lamb lemonata main and it was pretty good but a maybe a little chewy.  The ouzo to cleanse the palate was a generous serve.  The missus ordered a GF souvlaki and it came with a little GF certification sticker on the napkin.  So all is forgiven.  Final note: if you are expecting to see Greeks in the kitchen and serving you, you will be disappointed. But we are a multi cultural society and the food was as ""authentic"" as I could imagine it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LU8zclF3EAE,"Food's ok place is too crowded seating bad, feels like your sitting on top of one another."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUtlalVBEAE,"The food was ok, but I'm not sure both skewers were made with lamb. Too toasted for my taste. The ambience is nice, especially the ceiling."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Nkt1U21RRRAB,Stalactites has bomb kebabs! I use to go here few times when I was in my youth! Now I take my husband. The building aesthetic is beautiful too! The space is small but not a big issue.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OFBqUTVnRRAB,"A Lamb souvlaki to die for!!! So much food, so generous, staff excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b0pYY3d3RRAB,Great options for coeliacs!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzhTajRRRRAB,"Who doesn't love Greek food. Great menu...staff efficient...decor is basic except for ceiling. Didn't get 5 stars....food can be hit/miss, steak not good, so stick to Greek. Staff...don't explain the food or specials, but if you are a regular, not an issue. Love they are open late...quick and efficient to clear tables and sort drinks and food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjQyTVlnEAE,"Meatlovers perfect place...the food is awesome, lamb, beef, chicken, pita bread...excellent"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzZ5Z3ZRRRAB,"Delicious! But don‚Äôt order the calamari. We went after 6pm and ended up in the queue out to front. It moved pretty quickly. Only waited around 15mins. Expect a very busy and crammed room. Once you‚Äôre in your seat, don‚Äôt expect to be able to get out! Our chairs were touching the people behind us. The dips, saganaki, pita, mixed giros platter and Greek salad were all delicious. Satisfied our Greek craving! I just wouldn‚Äôt order the calamari again. Would definitely go back another time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSai12NmF3EAE,"A busy but great dining experience. If you arrive after 5 then expect to wait for a table. Service friendly and attentive, and the food arrived quickly but very well cooked and amazing flavour! Great for anyone gluten free as a celiac registered restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTlXUk5nEAE,I'm having dinner or lunch at this place since 2018. And I can say that they have very good food and service. There are many different dishes and the amount of food served is quite good. I'm still going once a month at least. Chicken and lamb are really good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTVta3dRRRAB,Like always. great food. Dips ar die for
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdF9MRmFREAE,Good for cakes.  Meal was ok but not worth the queueing. Had lamb shoulder. Cold and dried from being cut for some time. Pricey for what we got.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbTlxOTdRRRAB,"Coeliac accredited. Lots of GF choices. Lemon lamb dish was yum. Service was a little under par, couple of things missing, would have been helpful if staff came around the table to get orders rather than trying to hear and yell back orders. No opportunity to get a second drink so order two! Definitely focused on flipping tables for next sitting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eUpyVnp3RRAB,24HRs  but 10% public holiday surcharge +18 Night surcharge=28%
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUxuZEdnEAE,Enjoy everything we ate
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4a0tlRXRnRRAB,"Went for take away food. I ordered half soy chicken. When I see the box they prepare for me on the counter, feels a bit empty. Then back home and open it. There was no chicken breast part in the container."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjg3WUJBEAE,Tasty seafood laksa
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczlXSU1nEAE,Great food and good service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOWFmQWVnEAE,These guys try to overcharged you. They charge around 20% extra on Sunday instead of 10% as advertised. They did the same to the table next to me.  They just think your  a drunk white person at 2 am and you won't notice. I doubt they are doing it to one of there own
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeWJDSGl3RRAB,Very rude service from the aunties.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMGFLS0hBEAE,The lady at the counter is very rude as I am allergic to seafood I asked her can u please remove prawns from my dish and add chicken the girl was like can‚Äôt you see what‚Äôs written on the menu ! Such a rude staff !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3BpT3ZnRRAB,The food was okay. Some food was very salty and some very bland  Super bad attitude. Don't recommend it at all
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGRIMTF3RRAB,"Don‚Äôt get the noodle, it is just bland like most noodle in Melbourne, but the fried rice & chicken was quite good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3BqUWtnRRAB,Food was not good and service even worst. If your going by picture my omelette was burnt and overly salty.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnJqUjhRRRAB,"Always great food, fast service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbnIzaFdnEAE,"To me customer service is really important, that‚Äôs why this place lost a few stars. The food is delicious and served quite fast but the service is not very friendly. Also communication is not good either. When I paid cash I got charged 10% additional, when I enquired she pointed at a sign high up on a pole, 10% surcharge after 10 pm and weekends and public holiday. Didn‚Äôt even bother to explain this to me. Just pointing. I personally won‚Äôt return as there are other and more friendly places around. I enjoyed the laksa I ordered though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScnVDMTJ3RRAB,After public holiday they still charged extra surcharge no reason. Paid $27.73 for a rice and coconut drink. What a good life...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnMyeFVnEAE,Excellent Asian food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeW8zSUVREAE,"Wanton Noodle was bad. Noodle was hard and the worse thing, the lady seems like having bad day and complaints about customer to other staffs. The counter lady was freaking rude. Food and service were equally terrible."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXVfckFnEAE,"I bought half a roasted duck. The neck meat of several ducks below is also very thin. This is not half a roasted duck at all, but spliced ‚Äã‚Äãtogether. It‚Äôs really annoying. It‚Äôs time to close down cnm‚Äôs"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdk8yZWxRRRAB,"Roasted pork is delicious, the meat is tender and the skin is crispy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUlMY2tnRRAB,"This used to be the place to go for the best, affordable Chinese food. Unfortunately it is less so these days. The service is poor and the prices are ridiculous. $9.30 for 4 pieces of chicken feet.. Seriously! What a rip off, and to top it off, they were not fresh and seemed like they had been reheated a few times because they were gluey and chewy. I‚Äôm so disappointed and will never return!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUpmcDBRRRAB,Eat here for like a year but today I wait for 30 minutes to get 6 pieces of duck bones. This is second time Never ever get back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE12eFFREAE,Best place for a late night feed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSXzdtb1JREAE,"Very unprofessional, bad way of talking to customer, verbally loud when we ask how can we place order. Offensive tone."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNTZmS2h3RRAB,Love finding metal in my food for $19 noodles
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvc0o2MEN3EAE,The chicken fried rice is a must-try !!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzhUanlnRRAB,The staff were very friendly and provided great service. Prices are good value. Food was delicious. Highly recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekwtUVpREAE,not good. pricey aswell. the mushroom dish literally tasted of nothing. was like eating water. everything pretty average
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MU5HRS1BRRAB,"Must-order winter melon cup and foie gras noodles! The best food in Melbourneüëç Expensive but good service and delicious food Great for festivals, treats"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE5mOTBRRRAB,This place serves authentic Cantonese cuisine. There is a minimum spend of $50 per person
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjk2ek9BEAE,Bit rushed here. Food very good.  Only 1 hour allowed so a bit like a fancy fast food. Not cheap.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXFyS3dRRRAB,Bad service and bad food. Not worth your time queuing. Used to be really good and our go-to place for dimsum.  They have a minimum spending of $30 excluding drinks per person now haha
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHVTQjFnRRAB,"I used to be a loyal fan of this yum cha restaurant but things changed recently. No more traditional dim sum trolleys, you have to order from the sheet and wait for all dishes to be served at one time, dishes got cold easily after a little while. Chicken feet was not marinated properly, duck feet was stinky, prawn&scallop dumpling had no scallop inside. Most of the dishes are below average compared with other yum cha in Chinatown. Not even mentioning the astonishingly high price. They asked for tips though I could not see any decently customer service except rushing us to finish within the one hour limit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHRURUJREAE,"So so disappointed. Been here many times and quality has gone down hill. Service is good but Yum Cha with no trolleys? This is a big no no. Tick a box to order but then can‚Äôt order more cause you‚Äôve only got one checklist? Menu was also missing so many staples you would normally be able to order. Used to be so good, what happened? Expensive for what was offered."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ3JfcktREAE,An extensive range of dishes to pick from and each one is so delicious. Pick what you want on the menu and no trolley that comes around with the food. The prawn dumpling was slightly overcooked as the skin started to break and the xiao long bao had minimal soup but overall the dishes we had are what you'd expect from a yumcha. Prices are a bit on there expensive side.Note: best to book in advance as there's usually a line
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk1XU3hBRRAB,Really friendly staff and amazing food!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSck1UNTJBRRAB,"The taste is good, the price is a bit expensive, but the taste is worth it. It is very suitable for inviting people to have morning tea or dinner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd1BxYnd3RRAB,"We had the dimsum, which has one hour limit and minimum spending 30 dollars per pax + credit card surcharge + public holiday surcharge. Just every restriction u can think of. Also ridiculously expensive dim sum. And the food is not even nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjREeWpRRRAB,"Worst service imaginable, largely due to the obnoxious attitude and behavior of the waiter. I would give 0 star if I could. One of the waiters seemed to take pleasure in belittling you and your party, and made no effort to conceal his contempt. Making remarks that their restaurant is the Hermes of seafood restaurants while I was ordering food and taking pleasure in interrupting my ordering and making constant reminders of meeting their minimum spend were just some of the horrors that we experienced.  Overall, the restaurant with the rude, arrogant, and obnoxious waiter provided an incredibly unpleasant dining experience especially with very ordinary food. If you are looking for a restaurant with good service and a welcoming atmosphere, it would be best to steer clear of this establishment.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOWR6cFdBEAE,"Requested banquet for group. Gave budget of $60/per person. When final bill came, the charge was $85 per person (before drinks)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSenV5WlpnEAE,"Had Yum cha yesterday, and I was really surprised by the cost. Normally, it would only cost around $350 plus for 8 people, but this time we had to pay almost $600! The food was good, but I think I'll try other yum cha places in the city next time. On top of that, the booking time was limited to only an hour, which is ridiculous. It used to be an hour and a half per session, but not anymore (unless the booking is for the last available session before the restaurant closes at 3:00)  To make things worse, we had a really baffling experience with one of the waiters. We had booked for 10 people, but two of our friends couldn't make it. When I asked the waiter if we could keep the extra bowls and cutlery, he just kept insisting that we only needed 8 sets because there were only 8 of us. I was so confused and annoyed! Why couldn't they just leave them? We might need them later, and it's not like they were in a hurry to clear the table for the next booking. It was a pretty tense moment, and I just gave up in the end because I didn't want to ruin our lunch. I've never had this issue with any other restaurant before, and I think the management should look into this attitude issue with their waitstaff. It's not good customer service to insist on taking away items that customers might need."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3VTSW13RRAB,Rushed service 1 hour limit food was above average but watch out for their ‚Äúdefault 20% tip‚Äù when you tap your card for payment. Check your Receipt several other customers alongside us experienced that too. They insisted we pressed the tip button‚Ä¶ when we touch pay?!? Really? And 20% of the bill? We insisted on a refund of the said ‚Äútip‚Äù ‚Ä¶ highly unethical by any standards!!! Stick to making profits decently!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa3UtZVhnEAE,Not trolley YumchaüòèFried IceCream a sad ending to a beautiful meal... did not order crumbed icecream $30 for 2 serves... just rude to think thats ok or maybe didnt think we would know the differenceü§î Did get a discount...

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmF5dGxRRRAB,The lobster is soooooo good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobHZfMUpBEAE,Worst experience ever. Don‚Äôt go there for Yumcha. Expensive price with stale food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXVPcUdnEAE,"Found this place by accident ,had to wait 15 minutes for a table (no booking) was definitely worth the wait,the food here is above average and staff are super friendly. Easily going back with some friends next time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXVDQ2dRRRAB,"I recommend their egg tart and hakkau for their dimsum menu. It tastes good with rich flavour. However I not really recommends their xiao long bao as there are less amount of juice inside the wrap.  A bit overprice for their dimsum, but the ambiance is great for someone who want to hangout with someone."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoai1IcE1BEAE,Excellent
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodmVLaWh3RRAB,"Shame they don't do trolley service, but otherwise perfect."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoanFUT093EAE,Nice venue - upstairs (has lift) Big menu with lots of options - nice portion sizes and helpful friendly staff. Well presented and clean restaurant
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4LTUzZ0pBEAE,gotta get it here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeDZtSk9nEAE,it‚Äôs one of the oldest K restaurants in town but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it personally. Outdated

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdU85MhAB,Amazing amazing food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMzY2SXJBRRAB,"One of the worst Korean BBQ I've ever had. Meat was really poor quality. This place used to be good, but not anymore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZdGZTMThBRRAB,Nice Korean restaurant. Very kind manager and staffs. Delicious dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZeTZ2TVR3EAE,"As a person has Korean minority background and grown up in an area weigh strong Korean culture, this restaurant for me has the real transitional dishes.  Always feel like being at home when I have dishes here. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZcnYta1ZREAE,Just alrite. Not so much services we get. The restaurant only serve cass beer from korea
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZNk52NkpBEAE,"My partner and I both had an all you can eat BBQ grill, neither of us had ever tried Korean before but were pleasantly surprised. Nice flavours and variety, sitting at the Flinders Street Station feeling quite stuffed. It was very cool to see the food cooked in front of us, staff were friendly, overall a good experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZZ0xUMXBBRRAB,"Exceedingly ......bad....  . Definitely there will not be ' next time ' The food is not fresh at all and I stormed into the toilet before I even finish the BBQ.....all i can say is ....Thank you , next !  Peeps!,  I warn you !  If you wanna have diahrea or solve ya constipation situatuon,   feel free to go there ....you are very welcome ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNHBuQmJREAE,The food quality & service was just so bad......Everything marinated in a same sweetly disgusting sauce. Waste of money & felt sick after visiting this restaurant
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNjZxM1h3EAE,Turned up during open hours to find the place locked up with other confused people out the front wondering why it wasn't open
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvODhtU2J3EAE,"Not the nicest Korean food available around that area, but the select sets are at bargain prices."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaHUzZ3ZnRRAB,yes
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJaGVlUFZREAE,"Large meals, well cooked"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z1B1UTBnRRAB,"Fantastic place! Was served by the waitress Rosa who made the whole experience so much more! Dimly lit, intimate setting with charcuterie boards and an extensive whisky list. Decor is funky and vintage and it's easy to hear and listen to your friends without being too loud in surroundings."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNV9EM1BREAE,"I had the one of the greatest nights with my friends here for one of their 18ths, The vibes were immaculate, rustic and filled with decor and banging 60s and 70s blues and rock tunes from ZZ Top to Muddy Waters. Of course this couldn‚Äôt have been accomplished without the liveliness and cheerfulness of the bar staff and servers, massive f*cking shoutout to Rosa, they were so sweet, funny and filled the table with laughs. Also big ups Bryan/Brian/Ryan who was interested in our game of chase the chicken and was pouring drinks like a mad lad. 5/5, 10/10 would definitely come again. Thank you Boilermaker House! <3"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScy1QWDBRRRAB,Nice collection and good vibe

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMy1XdHlBRRAB,"While the atmosphere and drinks menu were top notch, the real star of the show for us was the service from very knowledgeable staff. We loved the decor and felt like we came across a hidden gem here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSel9TYzdBRRAB,"My wife and I had a wonderful evening here for a special celebration. Food and beer was fantastic, the oysters, cauliflower bites, snd truffle Brie were particular highlights. Our server Rosa also went above and beyond to make it an enjoyable evening - friendly and helpful, and some excellent whiskey recommendations even though I only gave her some pretty vague requests to work with. Will definitely be coming back as soon as we can get more babysitting!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSejlTTlJ3EAE,"We had a lovely date night here. Excellent food, beer & whiskey. Really knowledgable and friendly staff. Rosa was so warm & welcoming & a great guide to the back room whiskeys too. Thoroughly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdDYzUmtBRRAB,Whiskey menu is spot on
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbTRIQXVnRRAB,Nice place very good drinks.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdzVuODdRRRAB,the best bar in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGUzQmFREAE,Really good bar and ambience but service by rosa was not good. She was pointing us out for every small thing we were doing ( be it checking the curtains installed at our table or smoking outside out of the bar perimeter). She did not have proper knowledge of whiskeys as well. Louis on the other hand was very nice to us and serviced perfectly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmRfS05nEAE,Beeramisu the best
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtbjlmZTJBRRAB,"The food is absolutely to die for. Delicious plus and very filling.Great service , great value for money..going again Thursday night"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOC1lZC1RRRAB,"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. The waitress forgot to give our order to the kitchen and we were made to wait 1.5 hours for average food at best which is ridiculous. All waitresses were ignoring us because no one wanted to deal with us. What‚Äôs worse is after the 1.5 hours, the dish that I ordered was vegetarian and they bring it out with chicken and serve us someone else‚Äôs dish??? What a ridiculous restaurant, even worse waitstaff and awful service. Save yourself your time and money and go to the other way better Thai restaurants in the city."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteWF5ZFhBEAE,All the food I ordered was great and the staff were also very friendly. I will definitely come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNGM3bFJnEAE,"Super yum and super authentic! ‚Ä®Brought me back to Thailand. The menu can be a bit overwhelming because there are so many options. ‚Ä®I ordered the Tom Yum which was creamy spicy perfection.  For drinks I went with the Thai milk tea to wash down all the spicy goodness. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I had faith in the food being so good I order the Pad Kee Mow to go. ¬†I knew it would be great for lunch the next day, oh boy it did not disappoint. Again I was floored at the authentic amazing taste and quality. ‚Ä®Flat rice noodles with chilli, garlic, egg, chinese broccoli, basil in a black sweet sauce and oyster sauce! YUMMMM‚Ä®‚Ä®There's sitting in the little alley way and then they have a bigger restaurant space around the corner. Eat in the alley way if you can, makes the whole experience better. ¬†The alley way isn't great for groups though, a total of maybe 9 people fit inside. Again plenty of space for group in the main part of the restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHVuQUJ3EAE,Excellent Thai food - some of the best in Melbourne.  The red curry is exceptional!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMjhfSGNBEAE,"I had such a great veggie red curry here on a quiet late-night Tuesday that I had to go back. But they were so busy - no surprise - I opted for a couple of takeaways. If I lived in Melbourne, they would never see the end of me. The design is casual, boutique and Bohemian, and the space is comfortable, open and inviting - Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcmRfWXVBRRAB,Very nice food friendly staff too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMkxDUElnEAE,"Okay, milk tea is a bit hearty"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajQ3MVJ3EAE,"Best Massaman Beef Curry I have ever had in Australia. We also took Chilli and Basil Stir-Fry with Sticky, Jasmine Rice.  The beef was so tender almost melting in mouth, went pretty well with perfectly balanced sauce/gravy.  Will be going back to try some of their other dishes soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MjdqSm9nRRAB,"Based on their great Google reviews, we expected much better quality. We started with the the Tom yum soup and spring rolls. They both were pretty good. Unfortunately the beef stir-fry and the fried rice were below average. Also they charged us for a takeaway container and paying by credit card. The staff were nice and friendly."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bkpPNURREAE,"3 stars for the laugh this rollercoaster of a meal gave us. The food was good, nothing special but nothing wrong either.  As they had a proper laminated drinks menu we decided to order some cocktails and a beer.  It took 3/4 of underage looking staff to pour a beer without it being mostly foam.  And the encore: A Long Island ice tea. After two attempts and one send back, I gave up and settled for whatever this creamy concoction was üòÇ.  Please make sure your staff can make the items on the menu! (This cocktail was gross)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPei1xUkVBEAE,"Delicious, unpretentious, great-value-for-money food. We had the omelette with prawn meat, grilled chicken, crispy pork and a curry.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDdXUXBBRRAB,"Best lemon ice tea I have ever had. Got pad Thai chicken and massaman beef - pad Thai great and good value, massaman beef with rice costs 50% more and got 5 bits of beef - 1.5 of which were pure fat so quite expensive for basically soup with 3.5 bits of beef. Nevertheless I get the vibe this is a restaurant that has reallly good and good value things but will take a few goes to learn what‚Äôs best. 5 stars because of that iced tea - bottle that and I will buy it"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ckxhcWpRRRAB,"On the night of 5.12, the first woman at the cash register opposite the liquor shelf had short hair and glasses, seemed to be wearing pink clothes and a black mask, and her attitude was really bad. When I was in line, I kept waiting for the cashier to say next waiting until she finished chatting with her colleagues and turned her head to signal me to put the shopping cart on the table. After I put it on, she turned her head and continued to chat with her colleagues. When I finished the bill, I didn't say thanks, and didn't tell me that the bill was successful. I asked her if she was all right, and she didn't answer. Could it be that she is dumb? It shouldn't be, the voice is quite loud when chatting!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnA3OG1nRRAB,"Forget this place , keep walking . Food was horrible and whatever you order you get different. Don‚Äôt waste your money"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjhiZm9nRRAB,"It was very quiet when we arrived (9pm on a Friday night) and we ordered via the qr code. 25 minutes later we got our drinks, including 'china tea', which turned out to be a dilmah teabag. After 40 minutes we received our first dish- tea eggs, which were totally fine. Our steamed dumplings then arrived, which were stone cold. Another 10 minutes for our Chinese broccoli, which was fine, but cost $17. At close to an hour, we asked about our main dish (sausage mixed noodles) and were told it was 2 minutes away. Ten minutes later it arrived in a takeaway container (we requested this as we were super ready to leave), again cold. Like, fridge cold. The dish turned out to be egg noodles with some chili oil and sliced salami of some kind on top. Genuinely one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Chinatown."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUotR25nRRAB,"So many things wrong with this place. There was my group and only one other table of 2 people and the time for food was absolutely ridiculous. A couple of dishes came out and an hour passed before a couple more did. Over an hour and a half later, we still hadn‚Äôt received a serving of fried chicken which we asked about multiple times and kept being told that it was on the way. We ended up leaving and waited at the desk for someone to talk to about getting a refund, but no one came out after 15 minutes. So we left as we had somewhere to be, lost money because we couldn‚Äôt get a refund and didn‚Äôt get the food we came for. 2 of the servings of dumplings were still stone cold in the middle, they chucked it in the microwave and brought it back out. The outter layer was hot and inside was still cold. Left them on the table as they were inedible. To make matters worse, as we were walking out we saw TWO RATS run through a gap between the booth chairs ü§Æ absolutely shocked this place is still up and running."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc3ZxZUxBEAE,Food is always good

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMF9LMnBBRRAB,"we ordered and it took over 2 hours to get half our meal, it took so long to get the other half that we ended up leaving before getting the rest of our meal and we realised later that they had not started cooking it yet. food was slightly below average and noodles were undercooked."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaEp5VkFnEAE,"Tread lightly at the Ants Bistro.  Incredibly slow service between courses, chilli oil with no chilli, fried rice as bland as a pack of Salada's and to top it off the dumplings, which arrived 30 minutes late, are freezer bag quality. They just can't be homemade I'm sure of it.  Only saving grace is the bistro is BYO.  Do not recommend on any night let alone a Friday when you're starving after work."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNU4yVk9REAE,The taste is very authentic and the price is affordable
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybWJpQkdREAE,"Look, the food was decent but the service was shocking. This place has an online ordering system via a QR code on the table, so there's no excuse to get it wrong. Our table of 5 ordered pan-fried dumplings, two mains, fried rice and noodles. One of the mains came out first, so we picked at it, hoping the rice would arrive soon. Ten minutes later (maybe more?) the second main arrived. I asked whether our rice and noodles were coming soon, and what happened to our dumplings? Dumplings come first, I was told! I think another table got ours... Rice & noodles finally arrived, along with steamed dumplings. By then everything was cold. Also, trying to eat fried rice off a plate instead of out of a bowl with chopsticks is awkward! We won't be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMXN2OTBnRRAB,"If I could then I wouldn‚Äôt bother to give that one star‚Ä¶ had the worst food. We ordered dumpling and pork shredded something. After a long wait, they served cold dumpling which was supposed to be pork but there was only cabbage and onion. I told them and then they gave us back that same dumpling by heating up in a microwave after 15/20 minutes ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Jesus! wasted my money and time‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnFIOGNBEAE,"Places are struggling with staff, but it's ridiculous trying to staff a medium size restaurant with one cook and one waitress. Service was ridiculous slow, we ordered two dishes - one took 35 mins, the other came out 15 minutes later. Avoid!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ3FqSE9REAE,"We ended up leaving after one hour of waiting for our meals, the entrees were first in ok time but then 20 mins later first dish arrived, then a while later the fried rice was served and was missing bbq pork and shrimp just had rice peas and carrots. We sent it back as it was not what the menu described. Our other 3 dishes never arrived. When we approached staff they said we had been served all dishes, then they checked with the kitchen and they thought they had finished our order. We were even told they couldn‚Äôt serve prawn toast  as they had none but they still charged us for it. We were very hungry and dissapointed. The fact that no Asian people were dining in there was a big sign that it‚Äôs not up to their standards either. We paid for entree and one dish between the 5 of us and left very annoyed. Poorly run business, stay clear!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM08zdm53RRAB,"we came in and stood in the door way to be seated for 10 minutes (minimum) and was then seated at a filthy table. we were not given cutlery, napkins and we had to ask for water after being seated for 30 minutes (minimum). we had made our order after being seated and patiently waited for a while, until! we had noticed that tables seated long after us were receiving their food and drinks before us. we had ask two different staff members numerous times how our order was going, we were given no update. we were only then given an update on our food after 1 hour of waiting, we stood up and left. the whole time we felt as though we were denied of service. to give the benefit of the doubt there were only two waitresses and they looked under the pump."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM08zU2J3EAE,"!!!    DON‚ÄôT BOTHER GOING HERE    !!! I didn‚Äôt even want to give this 1 star. We arrive and are seated at a messy table, then an HOUR after ordering we still haven‚Äôt received our food. We didn‚Äôt even get water or cutlery until we asked half an hour later. Yet other people got their food within 15 minutes of being seated. We asked 3 times where our food was and the waitress said she‚Äôd check (but never got back to us until the end)‚Ä¶ We walked out very disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyN0xmc0x3EAE,"Very poor quality food, Restaurant floor poorly staffed thus service rushed and no attention to detail. Needs good clean and restaurant floor area updated and not used to store stock in view of patrons."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNTRYc0tnEAE,Where do I get started? 1 hour wait for our meal to be served.  Quality is average at best and certainly not worth the wait.  Avoid.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDhxekV3EAE,"Oh my God, this is a real experience to teach your kids just how bad a restaurant service could possibly be, we almost felt like we were on.a Faulty Towers skit‚Ä¶ so slow we were watching other tables bail & cut their loses & leave‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDZ5S0VBEAE,Ang don't bring the girls here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazZLYlRREAE,2 out of 6 of us threw up after eating the cold and microwaved food we were served. Honestly disgusting
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNVoyV2NBEAE,Epic hologram 5 stars
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb2NhWkJnEAE,"Worse experience I have had in Melbourne.  The meals would arrived at random times over a 1.5 hour peroid in no order at all. The food was either cold or tasted terrible.  The eating conditions were terrible, avoid at all costs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOXZuZUd3EAE,"Absolutely pathetic experience in relation to the service, food and ambience. How this restaurant is still running is beyond my understanding.  Stay away from this one."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMTlhXzJRRRAB,"I used to come here periodically - their chef was spot on, had real skills! I went again recently, and this time, the cooking was worse than my own... It was so bad, it was like the chef hadn't been to a nice Chinese restaurant before, and therefore didn't even understand what the dishes were supposed to taste like /look like... Also, every dish was overly salty. I don't know if it was an one off mishap, but, you could really benefit from a bit of quality control on your dishes..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUpHTXF3RRAB,Awesome restaurant for Sichuan Hot Pot and an icy cold beer.  Great choice of soup bases from traditional Chongqing style to milder ones.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMS12Z1NnEAE,"Good food, good service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3F2N213RRAB,I don‚Äôt think I had anything that was not spicy‚Ä¶ Food was really good! Will definitely come back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM3NheC1RRRAB,"Let down by reviews, Don't waste your money, Twice cooked Pork belly wasn't belly some other dried out pork cut. Very Poor. Our rice did not arrive with mains we had to ask for it, it arrived when we had  virtually quit on the main meals, Staff shortages aside, food was poor. Staff ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbkxXWDZRRRAB,Food is good but it‚Äôs a little bit salty though. Huge portions that you could take home and enjoy the next day.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDgyelR3EAE,Very tasty and affordable
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeC0ybWVBEAE,"Amazing service, food was unbelievably nice. Gave it a 4.4 out of 5. They had friendly staff, very comfy chairs, even provided chopsticks. They didn‚Äôt give us forks for fried rice or the duck that we ordered. They also didn‚Äôt pour water for us. Overall a nice experience but could improve on looks. Would love to come back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZy1YdFV3EAE,Very good  Recomendedüëçüëç ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScWZlVUpREAE,Tasty food every time and pleasant service !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdE5TR0xnEAE,"So sorry that I read the reviews saying how great this place is, we came from Ballarat where I own a Cafe.  The first thing we were handed was a dirty ipad to place our order, we ordered a couple of beers, they arrived with PLASTIC glasses. We asked for glass and our beer went flat with those too. The staff have very little English so communication was difficult (we have travelled extensively through South East Asia and had better communication) our order finally arrived the ribs first(with chopsticks only) then the kampong chicken arrived, finally our rice and dumplings we ordered for entree. We had to ask for clean plates and more napkins, there is a surcharge for Sundays, no one mentioned. Food was okay, service was abysmal. My first Sunday off in five years, thanks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa0tqb2RREAE,Amazing taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDZUb1pnEAE,"Had to ask for cutlery and plates so not a good start, but the food was aweful. Beef skewers rubbery, chicken in a wok is kfc fried chicken except it had an awful oil smell to it. Will not be returning‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMWN1NUNREAE,Great food with great service! üëç
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcVlXR1hREAE,Got served undercooked fried rice that wasn‚Äôt even something you could chew. Been let down a couple of times now.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeG9LcExBEAE,"Amazing food, fast service, great staff that are always smiling. Little hidden gem of Melbourne."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa3RhVkZREAE,"Inauthentic Sichuan/Chinese food. Ordered 4 dishes and only 1 (spicy fish soup with pickled vegetables) tasted authentic, very disappointing. Spent around $40+ per person. Charged an additional $0.50 for a takeaway box after the meal. Would not recommend - there are far better options in its near vicinity in Chinatown."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUo3VVJ3EAE,"Hidden gem.. Loved the food and the service. Cummins pork was delicious.. So was the kung pao chicken.. If you reach around 6 ish on a weekday, you will find it  pretty empty but just before 7, many start coming in."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodk1ta293RRAB,A restaurant that never disappoints. True taste of sichuan food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobEtDTlJnEAE,Kungpao chicken! What dreams are made of. Orgasm through the nose!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOUoya0x3EAE,Worse security you never experience anywhere else specialy that Indian guy with beard üòû ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd1BIaXpBRRAB,Good atmosphere. Cheap drinks. Healthy mix of unattractive women and attractive women
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoazhfN3J3RRAB,Drinks and entry were very affordable. The djs in both the bunker and main room were great! The bartenders were very friendly and helpful. Only reason I didn‚Äôt rate it 5 stars is because of security and the bouncers they were unapproachable and unfriendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaDhtV1R3EAE,"Such rude securities , worse experience ever,"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCanZXMnhnRRAB,"there‚Äôs a racist guard outside, you can only go inside if you‚Äôre not brown"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbV83aUtnEAE,Love the cold air machines best invention ever. I be sweating and dying on that dance floor and then cold air slams into my face. Most refreshing feeling ever. Plus $5 entry
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaXJub1NREAE,"Imagine you have a chronic elbow injury for a couple years and some time after surgery you finally have some confidence and courage to go out and be social. You wait in line with your friend for 2 hours who took the night off work to enjoy together and you are asked to button up one of the long sleeve shirts you are wearing, so as you do that you are told you are not getting in. There was no explanation from the rude security after I was complying. I felt as though the other people who were less cooperative and drunk were just passed in and I was discriminated against. Quite an upsetting experience and suddenly a night cut short. This isn't the place for me if security are unreasonable and treating others without respect."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaU9DNGpRRRAB,Your bouncers need to be educated on ID from other states. Someone holding a WA drivers licence shouldn‚Äôt need to show a second form of ID.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNDVPTW13RRAB,Worst club I have ever been to in my entire life. Wish I could give this -10 out of 5.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd2VXY3pBRRAB,"The good parts were drinks are affordable. Cheap entry. Sorry to say this But the atmosphere here is terrible. Music is very poor, left within 1 hour of being there hoping something would change. But didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ will not be coming back‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ3Nyanp3RRAB,"I would expect my 13 year old sister would sneak into and have a good time. Shockingly bad drinks services, terrible music selection if your older than 18 I would recommend not going here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ3Nyd3FnRRAB,"Average music average atmosphere, expensive entry, expect to see your younger cousin here and expect to be charged to here remixers of mily Cyrus‚Ä¶ there must be more in Melbourne"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtM2VMZndRRRAB,"Would not go here again, unprofessional staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldjRLdzdRRRAB,It's way too crowded inside and could hardly breathe.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZzZtU19RRRAB,Why are you spamming me with SMS with no option to opt out? I've never even been here
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ1pyVG5RRRAB,"dump security , This is a 0 star not 1."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aHVtSGRBEAE,Security have power trips and out randoms for no reason.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPemZmRWVREAE,"Ridiculously cool stage but doesn't offer a lot, venue-wise."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNjZLYVF3EAE,Disgrace
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaVBIWk5BEAE,We just wanted to have a drink or two and listen to some music and this was one of the few clubs that was opened on Wednesday night but they made it clear we were not welcome with just dismissed hand gestures (no words). Someone really needs to teach the security guards/bouncers some manners. I understand that they have to deal with a lot drunks and unruly folks but treating tourists the way they do just gives the club and Melbourne a bad name. They need to be sent to New Zealand to get some training on how to do their jobs.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbC1HbExREAE,Mudic was alright Toilets are disgusting & make sure you wear some shoes with grip
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemJpODNRRRAB,"Great food, terrible after dinner experience. Had a 2 hour booking on a Saturday night. 90 minutes into the booking we were presented with the bill and asked to pay immediately. Pointed out that only 90 minutes had elapsed and we were still drinking our wine. Met with blank stare by the waiter (the bald one). Earlier, he stated that they had people waiting for our table. So overbooking must be a thing here.  I would suggest going on a quiet night and not have your dining experience interrupted but baldy told us they have been busy all year, so that might not work.  Maybe larger groups (we were a party of 2), don't get bullied like this?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHNxcVBBEAE,Lived up to all expectations
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNFAtWElREAE,"Not as great as it used to be. No care in the service. Food was mostly just ok, but one of our banquet meal was replaced by another without consultation - we would have not ordered the banquet if we had known. Service was slow, waitresses were not friendly. Ridiculously and uncomfortably hot where we were seated. Another patron slipped on the wet steps on their way out, and no care was shown or given by staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSajdQV1RnEAE,Wonderful atmosphere and amazing food. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Red curry duck and the Brussel sprouts were a favourite.  10/10. I'll be back for sure!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdDUyUXBRRRAB,"Dined at seamstress the other weekend and the experience was exceptional. Food, wine and service all fantastic.  Even if not a fan, you MUST get the Brussel Sprouts - can‚Äôt stop thinking about them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3J5LWhBRRAB,Drink was mostly just ice and found it hard to drink
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa01mUmJREAE,Phenomenal cocktails and gorgeous brightly coloured fit out with hanging lanterns befitting of the Asian cuisine and draped clothing embodying the name. A great spot for a drink before heading to the dining room but also prior to eating elsewhere in Chinatown. I used this as a starting point before hitting up a variety of bars on a Friday night and it's a really classy and fun way to kick off
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX2VTUHhBRRAB,"Walked down here on a weeknight with a group of friends and the staff, service, food and cocktails were all incredible! I think this is going to become a must stop anytime I come back to Melbourne!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodmVIU2t3RRAB,Excellent service and good food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocnQ3TlRnEAE,Love this place. Great good and great service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXN6TVFREAE,Service was great. Food was average.  Scallop didn‚Äôt have much flavour. Duck curry wasn‚Äôt really curry‚Ä¶ Pork belly tasted floury? Wontons were alright Brussel sprouts were the best - crispy and flavourful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoblB2dUtBEAE,"Young girl serving us was beautiful, always checking in to make sure we didn‚Äôt need anything. Drinks and Food was amazing, we shared the the taster platter and some light dinners. So flavoursome ü§§"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHFxc1RREAE,Good serving sizes for sharing. Great food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodXNlWll3EAE,"The food was good and the service was excellent, the staff was very attentive to your needs. The dining atmosphere and decorations were great."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocXNyaHp3RRAB,"Great CBD dining & cocktail bar. Food is yum, but small servings"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb19DcWpBRRAB,"We walked in without a booking but were given a table if we could vacate it by 8.30. They quickly seated us with menus and water and proceeded to explain the menu. Loved that we could choose the size in most items. Our goal was to sample a variety of dishes so this suited us well.  Our feast consisted of sweet potato and snake bean poached wonton, duck and betel leave with Balinese sambal, crispy pork belly with Vietnamese salad, baked trout with sticky coconut rice, pumpkin and coconut custard to top it off.  Each dish arrived with lovely presentation and aromas that made the mouth water. Then, the taste buds awoke to such alluring and stimulating flavours, contrasting but harmonising textures and dishes that flowed seamlessly onto each other. Hard to pick my favourite, but the pork belly and trout were outstanding.  All staff were very welcoming, super helpful, attentive and accommodating - so unusual in itself. The decor has ties back to the building's history in textile manufacturing. The lighting and design created an intimate atmosphere that suits small groups and couples. Our experience here was faultless and we would be keen to come back and try out their other offerings."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdzVXb2N3EAE,"Intriguing selection of dishes on the menu! Our pick for the evening started off with Scallop sashimi with avocado cr√®me fraiche, shaved fennel and orange gel followed by Roti bread with lemongrass, peanut and cashew satay served along with Black garlic & squid ink barramundi, malay yellow curry with charred bean sprouts, wombok and seasame crackers‚Ä¶..and Sirloin steak with spring onion salsa and enoki mushrooms! A mouthful‚Ä¶..literally! :)  Clean and flavourful ingredients combined! There was alot going on but somehow worked well together. The malay yellow curry with the barramundi was subtle and not overpowering in flavour which complimented the dish very well. The roti bread was a nice addition to the Black garlic and squid ink barramundi as it served to soak up the rest of the curry. The scallop sashimi was a little bland for my liking but played well as a starter. The sirloin was cooked perfectly to my liking and was a great topper along with the bowl of rice which really filled up the space! Yes, pricey considering the size of dishes but the quality reflects this!  A must visit for its unique interior decor and historic past! The levels consist of The Sweatshop Basement Bar and Yard, Drystore Espresso, Dining Room and Cocktail Bar, each level different to the other.  Full of character and vibe for the enthusiast as this was a former textile factory, in the 1930s a sweatshop, brothel and Buddhist monastery! Yes‚Ä¶..I know!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNnRLNWhBRRAB,"We visited this little gem a few weeks ago before the theatre, where we saw a disastrous version of a Christmas Carol. Unlike the show our experience at the Seamstress was excellent and saved the evening. We had a wonderful meal from start to finish. Each course was presented beautifully. The variety of textures and flavours in each dish left us in anticipation of the next. We are pescatarians and the chef understood the assignment - preparing each dish as per our dietary requirements. The dishes were served to us with love, attention and a brief description of the ingredients, as were each of the cocktails. The ambiance was perfect and we had such a fabulous time. Glad to have found this place. We shall certainly be returning. Please note the restaurant is on the first floor, up a couple of flight of stairs - check for alternative access if stairs are a problem for you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaGN5TnFBRRAB,"Wpw, wow, wow. Food and service here are incredible. The duck and pork belly are outstanding.  Ambiance and service staff are   so impressive. Can't say enough good things  about the food, decor, ambiance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMnJQXzBBRRAB,"In this post Covid world, it was fantastic to be treated to true hospitality. Amazing food exceptional service, real passionate professionals. The food had amazing flavours and we had a banquet that left all of us salivating and full. Thanks for an amazing night and allowing us to experience an escape from reality"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbEtfQ0hnEAE,"I've dined here many times previously but after last night I won't be returning simply based on the unnecessarily rude/arrogant attitude of the male greeter. I haven't seen him before here, I don't know where he is from or where he thinks he works, but his manner and the way he speaks to customers is unbecoming in a relatively pleasant establishment. No, it's not the Ritz, but it's not McDonald's either. Interesting to read other people have commented in a similar way. The food was just OK. I've eaten better here previously. Such a shame."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzcVplVUpREAE,Lovely atmosphere and fantastic food and drinks options. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Lots of delicious vegan options. Is a great place for groups.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN3ZtRDdRRRAB,Excellent service. Had the banquet and and the food was delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ekp5bzJBRRAB,"Dont come here for quality shanghai food! Teribble sevice! Peking duck had no sauce, dumplings were mid and badly wrapped, noodles were extremely average + it is the only place in melb you have to pay for chillie sauce... go anywhere else! Unless ur drunk"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUxueTF3RRAB,Simple tasty dumplings and low-key service all for reasonable prices - Shanghai Village is a classic Melbourne establishment.  With a kung-fu film-set interior this unassuming resturant is up the top end of Chinatown but well worth the visit for a cheeky feed before a big night out.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b09uV2h3RRAB,Tasty food. Generous portions. Friendly servers. Reasonably priced. Order though QR code.  Affordable could easily eat under $15-20 per person. I had a noodle soup and a side. I didn't need the side dish.  No spilt bills. Even if you order separately bill is done by table.  A little scruffy but venue but felt hygienic and I'd eat here again happily.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z0t1aFZnEAE,Their dumplings are to die for!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNzlLbzJRRRAB,Snake beans were good but their signature Shanghai dumplings tasted just like white pepper. We ordered all three flavours takeaway. Came here years ago and remember loving it but won‚Äôt be back for their thick-skinned peppery dumplings.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVltRWtBRRAB,"Gets pretty damn busy on a Saturday night, so I'd recommend making a booking. Overall, the place was decent and reasonable, everything considered. However, personally I didn't like the fact that they were using heaps of one time use take away cutleries and bowls."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWU3VW1BRRAB,Best dumplings in chinatown!!! The fried chicken and prawn are a winner!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWJfaGFnEAE,Food is definitely nothing to rave home about but good customer service from staff. Wish they added more condiments for the snack
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmRiMTR3RRAB,Bad service!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNGI2X0NREAE,Food is amazing and great price dumplings to die for
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenRPQ0ZnEAE,"As Chinese Indonesian, the only food that is acceptable is xiao long bao, the rest is bland (noodle, sweet sour pork)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSem9HeEZ3EAE,"Food wasn't very nice or authentic, quite bland. Not very good value."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenFqdDBBRRAB,"Terrible service, I ordered a sweet and sour pork, but it took 45 mins. Dumplings were ok, but what really shocked me is that you need to pay $1 for a little spoon of chilli oil. The sweet and sour pork tastes horrible. I don't recommend this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHNyN1JREAE,"You get what you pay for, cheap eats , not for us ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3RmQV9BRRAB,best dumplings I‚Äôve ever had
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk15V0hREAE,This is a nice little chinese restaraunt! The highlight is definetly the fried rice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScE5UdG13RRAB,They serve my order to other place then it took more than 10 mins and even didn‚Äôt say sorry. Terrible service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxci1QQjd3RRAB,Bring drinks and eat cheap dumplings
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbVAyNjJRRRAB,XLBs were yummy. Queues were long and service was quick and fast. It‚Äôs not a fine dining place so expect it to be loud and noisy! It‚Äôs probably on purpose so ppl can move out when they are done!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzVPRXZnRRAB,Delicious meal and great punch jug.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZy1PendnRRAB,Very nice place with lots of options and friendly staff!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZy1QVTNBRRAB,Lovely place! I really like the variety of dishes. My favourite is the yakisoba and the takoyaki! Delicious food and fun drinks.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZ18zWkdREAE,Service and food amazing. We got a hole table full of delicious veggie food and enjoyed our dinner. 10/10 would recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzdXN1ZnEAE,"Very very delicious, really nice to share and service was perfect!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGJ1Tjl3RRAB,"Great little find! Stumbled across here while attending the Melbourne Comedy Festival. Service was sensational and all team members were friendly and accomodating. Menu was good too, lots to choose from. Will definitely pop by again."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodWV1UGxBRRAB,"Just wow,  This place is amazing the food is amazing my fellow friends and I loved the food here. Our favourite would be the Yakisoba noodles and the curry. Drinks wise one of my companions commented the lemon lime bitters was amazing. The service was great and we had no issues. Literally we had no issues whatsoever with the food. Easily coming back soon  Food: 4.5  Service: 5  Wait time: 4.5  Overall: 5"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteWRYS093EAE,"My friends and I really enjoyed our dinner here. Their hot udon soup was so nice - the dashi broth was tasty and the noodles were bouncy. Their zaru soba was really tasty too. We also ordered the cheesy chicken karaage, which had the perfect balance of saltiness, sweetness and savoury-ness. Their wagyu beef and teriyaki chicken stone pot rice were so delicious, and so was their Japanese curry. They were packed with so many wonderful flavours. The staff were kind and friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNk9XNFpBEAE,Matchu biru

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbjdXWVpREAE,Good taste good food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldGJuWTdRRRAB,The food and customer service is so good! Definitely one of the best customer services I‚Äôve had yet!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcGZfblRnEAE,"Brilliant food, service and mood music. Cannot wait to visit Melbourne again so I can go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcUktVTdRRRAB,Great experience. They checked allergy information and were very helpful and friendly. Food was also delicious üòã. ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcjdibk1REAE,Food was alright but hella overpriced and our waiter was terrible Drecksladen
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcW9YOFdREAE,Great food and staff and was really cheep for what you get!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NjhxOEdREAE,"Didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I booked dinner here.  Wasn‚Äôt much to look at inside. However, from the initial greeting by the friendly staff member, the easy method of ordering using a pad device, then the best part, the food, the experience was great! After I ordered, a member of the wait staff came over, confirmed my order, by going through the printed receipts from the ordering app.  The food came out very quick.  Beautifully presented and made with very fresh ingredients.  The flavours were fantastic.  Prices are very reasonable.  Staff, as I mentioned were great! You can walk out of there having had a great feed for one person and a glass of wine for under $50!  Give them a try!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX3RYcWFnEAE,"Can be a tad bit pricey depending on what you get but the food was great. Service was mediocre at best with my first dish taking just under half an hour to come, which is a bit strange considering the portions. Nice place to go every once in a while but definitely not somewhere I would go regularly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NW9qaTN3RRAB,"Delicious skewers, wide selection of items, and perfect for dates and business gatherings. Ended up losing my satchel there the other night, and they graciously kept it safe until I returned. Will absolutely come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4b0xuQTdBRRAB,Had a drink (or two) here. Friendly servers and good drinks knowledge. Want to come back and eat!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0txY0J3EAE,"Been here many times - but came in most recently for Pre Theatre menu. Great option to see before Mary Poppins, very close and great value. Great selection of dishes like the kingfish, duck curry and dessert. Absolutely love the cocktails as well!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z0l2RElnEAE,"First impressions can sometimes ruin an experience and this was fearful once we walked in and were made feel like an inconvenience with the offhand attitude of behind bar staff greeting diners downstairs. However, once upstairs and seated, the mood and environment changed to the other scale of the service chart with wonderful, friendly attitude and demeanou. All food ordered was way above expectations and sensational in taste,  quality and serving size. Started with prawn buns from the Cold menu then followed with the pork belly dish, paired with crispy corncakes and wok tossed veg in a spicy mushroom and garlic sauce. Food was amazing and could have ordered almost anything and been satisfied I'm certain. Just a shame attitudes shown downstairs spoil the broth, while upstairs shone brightly. Would return next visit and recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaF8tOHB3RRAB,Great lunch and very attentive service from Cesar.  He provided a great wine recommendation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamFLd2dBRRAB,Everything was perfect especially the adjustments made to the menu items for the vegan diner of the party
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOFl1eERBEAE,Amazing food mostly very spicy so be careful. For me slickness was adding the whole me dimension to wonderful dishes. Thank you!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHJfUEZnEAE,"Great food.  I was wanting to visit Ginger Boy for 7 years and finally made it there.  Everything on the menu looks delicious.  We tried the chicken ribs, beef tartare, snapper and the dumplings.  Flavours were brought together really well.  We were a little disappointed when they didn't do their last orders for dessert before they closed the kitchen and said they couldn't serve us.  Finally, they did see our dissapointment and gave us the dessert menu.  We are glad we had the dessert, it was outstanding!  Staff was friendly. Really good vibe to the place.  Whoever had their play list on for music that night - üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3NQVUN3EAE,"Food was great, as were the cocktails. Service not so much."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEt5N2h3RRAB,Very good food and service but slightly on the expensive side.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0lpblJREAE,Delicious food and excellent service from our host Maddie. Great way to celebrate our anniversary.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDhuLTdBRRAB,"Best experience in food. Service was 5 out of 5, and Arthur and Laura were amazing and excelled in explaining the menu and how to enjoy the food more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeGFqVVV3EAE,"Our waiter Callum was amazing! Best service we‚Äôve had in ages. Delish food, drinks and wine recommendations. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU11bmtBRRAB,"Went to gingerboy this week for dinner. Food was amazing, especially the kingfish and scallops. Laura our section waitress was such a good vibe. Same as maya. The both Germans together are such a gem. Thanks girls for explaining how to cut a snapper to us. Gingerboy: you made our night so special"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNklhZTNnRRAB,"Impossible to fault! We had the pre show menu and the food was among the best we‚Äôve eaten - can‚Äôt wait to come back and try the full banquet. The staff were especially lovely and attentive, ensuring we were seated and served quickly after arriving late, so we wouldn‚Äôt miss our show."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSME5MZkZ3EAE,"Great restaurant hidden down Crossley Place. Can choose from a set banquet or a la carte. The food was delicious, couldn't fault it. We chose just enough from the menu and our service person guided us well. The drinks complimented our food perfectly.  The atmosphere was lovely in the main room. Not too dark, nice lighting though it reflected off the mirrors oddly at times.  Will go again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDk2LW1nRRAB,Food. Good $95 banquet but no better than quite a few lesser options at other establishments. Wine cost over the top (Triple  Punkt Riesling $76 ). This can be bought at Vintage Cellars for $22. Overall not at bad but probably won't make the trip from Sandringham again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLTRLUFpREAE,"The best service you could imagine - our train was running late so they pushed back our Saturday night booking with only 1hour notice - so grateful! The staff here are a total dream, as is the food. Thank you for the delightful waitress that served us upstairs, you were so helpful and funny and made our night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocThmLXVRRRAB,"Honestly ginger boy is a must go to restaurant in Melbourne! Not only was the food incredible but the service was also the best we have had. The food was incredibly delicious and well worth the money you spend as well as the cocktails, everything was so amazing. The service was honestly so good. We were so well looked after and our waitress Alison was so great, she made us feel like a friend to her and was so personable and even gave us some great recommendations on other cafes that were awesome (ps. the matcha place was amazing). This was the absolute highlight of our trip to Melbourne and would 110% recommend dining here if you get the opportunity to. Thanks so much to the whole ginger boy team who made our dining experience one to never forget ‚ú®Ô∏è We will definitely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeTkzZi13RRAB,"Our waitress was really wonderful.  Very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us really sound advice about quantities of food to order.  Highly, highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczk3cUN3EAE,Great food but very pricey. Staff were amazing and brought me a happy birthday dessert! Will def be back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod19MVXpnRRAB,Fantastic food. Great service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodGZDY1dnEAE,"What a fantastic night, food was amazing the service top notch! Johann looked after me and my uncle and made sure we were well looked after."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaGFEMWp3RRAB,"We have been to Gingerboy a few times now and it is still the benchmark in Melbourne asian fusion restaurants. Every dish is impressive with beautiful flavours, creativity and very high quality ingredients. Along with the amazing food, the service is always on point and friendly, thanks Johann. Gingerboy is an absolute must go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodWV1NnBRRRAB,"Celebrated my birthday here with friends on Saturday night. It was fabulous!! The food was amazing, the service was outstanding and the restaurant manager Arthur was an absolute delight!‚Ä¶I highly recommend it!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodG9hcHpnRRAB,"Amazing food we had the banquet, will be back"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob3BfaTV3RRAB,"We got in last minute for a Saturday night, amazing customer service and experience. Oysters, dumplings and crispy pork belly were delicious, as were the cocktails. The staff member serving our table, Hershaw (hoping my spelling is right?) was knowledgeable with the menu to help make recommendations and made the night memorable by organising a surprise dessert for our anniversary! So lovely and attentive, thank you Hershaw."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX2ZQd053EAE,"Bar staff are not helpful or friendly. We were told by one girl that certain beers were available for the happy hour special only to be overcharged and told by another staff member that the beer we ordered wasn't included after being poured, and forced to pay full price. Terrible service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLUlMQXNBRRAB,Very rude staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNkxyTGRnEAE,"Went on Sat 11 Dec, early afternoon. My wife wanted to taste a wine before she bought one, but the bar girl was so rude, she decided to pass altogether."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMXR5U1pnEAE,Wrong steak came out. I raised it with the waiter and they didn‚Äôt care. I ate it but expected a better response.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNUpmT3NBRRAB,"Lovely food, surrounds and service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaWNXOTJ3RRAB,"I used to work nearby so Laconda was my local.  But now even after more than a year of working at the other side of Melbourne I keep going back.  We almost always start our Friday nights there.  Great, friendly staff.  And love happy hour!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ1lDNjFBRRAB,"Excite your taste buds with the signature house dryed beef steak and yummy porterhouse steak ü•©, it was perfect. The Expresso Martini is on another level. ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdVpQNE53EAE,Fantastic cocktails and such friendly staff.  There chefs really  know there trade well. The steak was beautifully prepared and presented extremely well on the plate. We had three different cut of meat and they were all cook to perfection. Our family really enjoyed a great night out
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaXVYX2t3RRAB,"We had a small lunch reception after a registry wedding at Locanda Private Dining and Deli. The events sales coordinator Emma was so helpful with any requests before the event.  Sheyenne, Daniel and Nancy made sure the lunch event went so smoothly. Their customer service exceeded my expectations. They were on point, helpful and friendly to all guests.  The staff also helped me to setup the venue perfectly. I was just floored when I arrived to see how beautiful it all came!  The food was amazing and so beautifully present from the yummy canapes to the plated meals! Our guests were so happy and left full.  I'd also like to thank the Chef for presenting our wedding cake so beautifully with fresh berries and cream.  As a bride with a hospitality and events background, I would highly recommend Locanda for any events in the future.  THANK YOU TEAM!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaktLaEVnEAE,"Liam is a fantastic drinks technician, happy, friendly service from all bar staff. Will be back again when we come back to the city, recommend go before happy hour as Liam will make drinks to your taste and is more than happy to explain what goes into the drinks, has the best people skills of ANY cocktail technician I've had the pleasure of meeting. Liam thank you for the great service and conversation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaEx1QXF3RRAB,Don't waste your money here. The only good thing about it is the lovely staff. The worst risotto we have ever been served and the crispy skin duck was not rendered and therefore not crispy skinned.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLd09fVTd3RRAB,Great food and venue
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXzRqYmV3EAE,Nice bar for an Aperol spritz during happy hour. Friendly bar staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX3BpaThnRRAB,Great location plenty of outdoor seating. Has a happy hour but be sure to check the menu.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdHJiVlFnEAE,It's a bar.... In a hotel. They have drinks. Plenty of space.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cy1LVzd3RRAB,We had our wedding reception dinner here. The staff were all very friendly and the space was amazing. The staff were very accommodating with our requests as well. The food was delicious and we had a few different options as well and each dish was delicious. Fantastic space and worth every cent!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5OXFtRFpBEAE,"My partner and I booked Locanda‚Äôs Deli Private Dining Room for an intimate dinner with our families after getting married at the Registry Office. Communication with the events team - Kate and Jenelle - was great, very fast and helpful! The feasting menu was a perfect amount for the 10 of us and was all so delicious! The restaurant manager, Nancy, and the servers were all very helpful and friendly The room itself was absolutely gorgeous, we could have left it as is (but I would recommend a couple of floral arrangements and some candles to anyone wanting to do something similar) It was a very affordable evening as well and we felt as though we weren‚Äôt taken advantage of just because we were celebrating a wedding. We had an amazing evening and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdk5XaXNBRRAB,Less bad than before the pandemic. Now they seem to care about service and have not yet been overcharged
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb1pIWjN3RRAB,Great place. Very friendly staff. The food is good too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvejV1dUdnEAE,"Bar food is poor quality especially the schnitzel burger, burnt and just tough. Bartender- tall slim guy with short hair. Just talking too much and trying to be funny but ends up coming accross as rude and invasive. He didn't listen and made a lot of mistakes with drinks. Asked him to bring some sauce mid meal and he didn't care and told no one."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4cVl1WGxBRRAB,Very good ambience. Was crowded as it was a Friday evening. The meals were prepared and presented with care and we enjoyed them.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4aWRIZF93RRAB,"The food is amazing and the staff are fantastic, can not fault anything. Love it"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeDlyRE9BEAE,Nice wine list
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNkxpdWZnEAE,"A fantastic meal,  the duck  is amazing !!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczhxZjRBRRAB,Nice food and good service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSay1lWVVnEAE,"Lovely atmosphere,great and friendly staff"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHM3QVZ3EAE,"Very overpriced.  Staff were great,  food would have been ok at half the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURod19DbUZBEAE,"Sad to have to give a negative review but honestly we did not have a good time here tonight. I came for the cheese but was disappointed that the chalkboard selection has vanished and now you get 3 cheeses of their choice. This included a very average cheddar I would never have chosen. I asked about condiments and was assured there was ‚Äòa selection‚Äô. What I got was a sad pile of soaked sultanas only.  My wife fared equally badly although it was really her fault. She ordered Snapper with sides of broccolini and chips. She didn‚Äôt realise the snapper was raw, ceviche style. Her fault but you‚Äôd hope in a restaurant of this quality that the waiter might notice that the customer may not be aware the fish is raw.  Not great  Ps Thanks for your response. Your condescension and insincerity noted."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjZPVTVRRRAB,atmosphere good. mixology knowledge slim. I‚Äôd stick to ordering anything they dont make themselves.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMDVYRzVRRRAB,"Punch Lane has a stunning menu, space and atmosphere. The wine choices were wonderful and the food was delicious and beautifully presented. My husband took me on our first date to Punch Lane 10 years ago, and we returned last week for our 5 year wedding anniversary to find that it was still the perfect date venue."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdGJEdk53EAE,"Simply delicious! Had a lovely meal at Punch Lane - ordered the salad, pumpkin gnocchi and chocolate ganache. Every dish was so full of flavour - the gnocchi were like like pillows that melted in your mouth and paired nicely with the smoked cheese and pumpkin pur√©e! The chocolate ganache was to die for - will probably go back tomorrow for another!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdWFQcVV3EAE,Fantastic wine selection and food was I'd say inspired by french but very modern.  Staff really happy to help.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSck96QnBRRRAB,Great service and very welcoming vibe. The toastie was a yummy late night snack! Camilla and Dennis were awesome!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc0tHS1pnEAE,Amazing. Always.  Try the bread. You won't regret it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWFYX0tBEAE,"Great food, great wine. Very attentive staff. And dud I mention how great the food was? A gem in Melbourne!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGZyTTh3RRAB,"Fantastic service, great food, the inside vibe is definitely wintery but still very nice. Would recommend , try the duck."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ1lLMHZBRRAB,"This is my most reliable wine bar in Melbourne and located top end (Spring St) of Little Bourke St. Great selection of wines, nibbles, and great ambience. If I don't visit here on my trips I have not been to Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMU9qLXd3RRAB,Tasty lamb and john dory.... oysters were tasty. Wine list is solid.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeU5PVzRnRRAB,"Intimate atmosphere. Passionate, experienced and personal service. It was a lovely and indulgent date spot."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocnUzRzh3RRAB,"We haven‚Äôt yet had the pleasure of eating at Punch Lane but the reason for this review is to note how wonderful their customer service was when I had to cancel our reservation as we had become sick with covid. I had booked and paid for the Valentines Day dinner and when spoke with Jane and told her what had happened, she immediately offered to refund me or give me a credit. She was so kind and understanding and made everything so easy. I can‚Äôt wait to go and eat there in the future!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeXNyWmFnEAE,"My mum and I dined at Punch Lane last night and it was amazing. From the booking process right through to paying the account. All the wait staff were outstanding, going above and beyond. From finding us burrata that we were so keen on having, to letting us try a certain wine before buying. The margaritas were amazing and the gentleman didn‚Äôt even mind my mum asking for certain ingredients. I have already recommended Punch Lane to all my Melbourne friends and I‚Äôll be sure to recommend to any visitors from QLD. The food was delicious, we loved the burrata and the swordfish. The wine was lovely, I‚Äôd be keen to see what specials pop up using the coravin. If I lived in Melbourne, this would be a local for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoME4tR0N3EAE,"I recently TRIED to visit Punch Lane Wine Bar and was extremely disappointed with my experience.  As someone who uses a wheelchair, I felt discriminated against and dismissed by the staff. They called me on the day of my reservation (I booked weeks in advance). The attitude of the staff was rude and unaccommodating, making me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. Staff repeated it 3 times to me, as a heritage building they were not required to comply with ‚Äúaccessibility requirements‚Äù. They also mentioned the very ‚Äúpetite toilets‚Äù which made me feel like I shouldnt even try using the bathroom.  I understand that heritage buildings are not required to change the build. However, it‚Äôs the consideration and delivery of the message which made me feel so excluded. To make matters worse, there were no options provided to accommodate my needs. I drove past and saw there were tables outside on the footpath which would have been perfect for me.  I was extremely disappointed with my attempted visit to Punch Lane Wine Bar.  Update:  I Appreciate the owner for responding. However, they were not part of the conversation and I am entitled to how I feel. Please do not compare disabled individuals and their accessibility requirements - everyone is different.  Completely understand and agree Melbourne weather is unpredictable. It could have still been mentioned and provided. I apologise to the owner as I understand that this is your livelihood and have since updated my review.  However, front of house staff are a reflection of the business‚Äô value and service. I do believe the whole situation would have been different if I had spoken to the  owner who has lived experiences having a loved one with a disability. But this was not my experience. I think some training and empathy from staff was all I was looking for.  There is no need for a phone call. I also wish you and your restaurant all the best."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCXzhpVDVnRRAB,"Punch is a laneway staple in Melbourne. Always consistent, good service, good food and good staff. It's at the top end of town, so a bit pricey, which is the only downside."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCX2RPV1NBEAE,"Always wonderful service, and quality wine and cocktail options"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN3IyRHlRRRAB,We were a party of 6 for dinner. The restaurant and service was A1. The food was tasty and very nice however the portion sizes were tiny and at the prices charged didn't feel like it was good value I'm sorry. $18 for two small croquets. If it wasn't that I ordered fries as well you would be leave hungry.  I want to go back again great atmosphere but for food they need to increase portion sizes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd3YtU01REAE,"We were greeted with open arms by Camilla and led to a lovely laid table in a wonderfully cool dining room as Melbourne sweltered at 38 degrees. Drinks were promptly served and then we were introduced to Coco who looked after us for the next 2 hours. Food was sublime, quality paramount. Sharing is the idea. Portions we thought were perfect, not huge and that‚Äôs a good thing. You can see the love put into offering superb produce. We had the scallops (1 each), the steak tartare  - sensational (1 each) and then shared 2 large of the Gnocci (superb) & lamb (cooked to perfection). Then finished with the 2 desserts on offer, a Cr√®me fra√Æche bavarois & Valrhona chocolate fondant, both highly recommend. An amazing meal that highly recommend and will visit again when next in Melbourne. Thanks Camilla for your effervescent & hospitality. Great team work."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCckpMYWZREAE,"Called in tonight with a group of 6 , bar was only quarter full, waited for over half and hour for the useless staff to Not find us a bottle of their wine off their wine menu Finally had a drink from a second choice that still took another 10 minutes to locate , really ! Two staff one duty more concerned about cleaning up than customers"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaDYzc213RRAB,Very disappointing. I was not wowed by the food and it was very noisy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaTdHczVBRRAB,"Swordfish starter was amazing ü§© We had the steak for main which was unbelievable also, dessert was a little underwhelming though unfortunately."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ckkzYTZnRRAB,Best food ever. Delicious it was. Thanks guys.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cEozNm53RRAB,Highly recommended place on a weekday.  Went here on a wednesday eve right before seeing a show at her majesty's theatre.  Banquet is the best option if it's your first time. Highly recommend the somtam salad. You can ask to make the spice to a mild level if you have low tolerance for spicy food.  Nice interior decor as well as fixings. A nice touch on the coat rack that is placed near your table instead of a central location.  10/10 will definitely come back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d1BhQ2pRRRAB,Me and a friend had the Pre-theatre set menu and were blown away by the food. Absolutely delicious and will definitely be going back again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczZtSFRREAE,"Disappointing, sad experience of what used to be a favourite in Sydney. Waited 20 mins to be acknowledged by staff sat at bar table for one. Food arrived quicker than believable that a chef had prepared it, or even reheated it to warm enough to eat. Tough beef curry, def not worth the price. Trendy stemless wineglass made for disappointing glass of shiraz to match. Reputation is one thing, delivery is another with so much competition in the area...competitor across the road full with people queuing for tables. I'll wait in line next time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWVIVTVnRRAB,Food was delicious and cocktails are very good. Service from our waitress Helena was outstanding. She accommodated our adjustments to the dishes and drinks with a smile and professionalism. Will definitely return for round 2 at Longrain.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScWNiRFJBEAE,It was a great experience and the food was scrumptious. Really friendly and helpful service made the experience even better. Kudos to our waitress Helena. We will definitely come back ü§ó ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX3M2aWFBEAE,"love this place and would love to go back soon! High quality food and unbeatable service, The Betel leaf appetizer was a refreshing way to start. Lamb ribs and coconut chicken was simply delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnF1ajhRRRAB,Really amazing and tasty food. The restaurant is beautiful and the serving staff were really professional.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXRtSXF3RRAB,Excellent food!Highly recommend.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUtHNkJBEAE,"Im Regular longrain sydney customer. But today‚Äôs experience at longrain melbourne was very unacceptable. We have to wait for 1 hour for the food , we ordered 3 caramelized pork belly and 2 of them are overcooked , it was very difficult to bite the crispy part  tough to eat. Also we have to wait another 40 mins for the ice cream.  Furthermore, we handled by the rude and impolite waiter ( girl).She answered all the question with the high tone when we ask her  to explain one more time. And also she put the spoon without a napkin / plate on the dirty table for our dessert and got very angry when we asked for the new spoon. She took all the spoon from our table with bad attitude and throw all the spoon very hard into the dishwasher. I was amazed that one of the waiter in longrain could do that to their customer. 5 stars place 5 stars price 1 star service and attitude. Tamarine fish was delicious Eggnet was delicious  Definetly wont come back to the place that cost you $100+  / person and the place which asked 10% for service charge when we were not being serviced politely. Totally different with the one in sydney. Its sad when the other team work very hard but the frontliner cannot do the job properly.  Cheers to the manager who tried to calm us down, you did a great job. but i am sorry your waiter attitude is unacceptable.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNU9iUTJRRRAB,Very bad services from waiter Her name is phim or phom Clean -10 Experience -10 Arrogant +10 The food came out very slow. The waiter put the spoon on the dirty table without napkin and get very angry when we asked for new spoon because the spoon is dirty.  The caramelized pork is overcooked. Definetly will not come back to this place. I am Regular longrain customer in sydney
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMkpMRUNBEAE,Innovative menu of seriously good tasting food. All four dishes that we ate were yummy. Service was friendly and helpful and food arrived in a timely manner. Enjoyed the ambience of the venue
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd0xDTkVREAE,"I was severely disappointed with this restaurant. I was expecting a near fine dinning experience (the price range would suggest so). But what I found was:  - Food; not better than Thai town and DoDee. The presentation is somehow more curated, but the flavours are similar.  - service: this was the biggest disappointment. Two interactions with the waiter made us very uncomfortable. I believe that in Melboune food wastage should be avoided at all cost. When I asked for a container to pack 3 plates we had barely touched (we over ordered) the waitress made us feel very uncomfortable with it. ""We don't usually do this here.... I will see if I can find something... You are lucky we had this containers... We continued to smile and nod. I can't believe that at this day and age your restaurant promotes food waste.  The second time was when. It was time to pay. The bill was brought to the table unannounced. Payment terminal in hand. This is with the rest of the restaurant having 50% of the tables occupied, not that we were last. I had my phone off, because I like to do so when I am dinning and it is of no one's business if I do so. When I announced to the waitress that it would take a couple of minutes for the phone to turn on and be able to pay. I was expecting for her to go and return in 2 or 3 minutes but instead she stayed the whole time by the table and I terrupted twice our conversation to ask: - is it on already? - do you not carry a card? It literally took less than 2 minutes for the phone to turn on and she was rolling her eyes.  Overall, very disappointed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbl9UbG1nRRAB,This was my second here and it didn't disappoint. I love the Little Bourke St location close to the Princess Theatre. It's a roomy restaurant with loads of atmosphere. Don't miss the saltbush sticky lamb ribs. The cured king fish was also fresh and zesty. The betel leaf entrees were also fantastic. I thought the southern red curry we had could have been a little hotter and spicier
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSejhUX0xnEAE,"Great place for formal dinner, fancy but the food was hit and miss. With some things just too small, or just too experimental so it didn't quite taste right. Expensive but service was excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTYyWU9REAE,"It‚Äôs been a couple of years between visits and the first impression they made upon arrival was abysmal. No one to greet you as you enter the restaurant so I loitered for a bit before tentatively venturing in. By the time someone appeared they attempted to unlock the iPad to find my reservation but didn‚Äôt know the passcode so off they went to find someone to advise and returned to try again.  This happened a further three times asking different people for the code on each trip before they eventually managed to unlock it (after accidentally setting it to camera mode and me helpfully advising how to turn it off). At this stage quite a queue had formed behind me and it struck me as quite clunky and unprofessional.  The bill came to around $115 a head for the banquet and two bottles of wine which is probably not too bad (if you are drinking the wine which I wasn‚Äôt but $89 for the food given we added the egg net) and I appreciated the way they made adjustments to the menu as typically when it‚Äôs a set menu I eat around my food requirements/preferences but when I advised them I didn‚Äôt eat oysters or pork they accommodated with different dishes that they accommodated the pescatarian and vegetarian with.  As we were a group of 8 the set menu was obligatory. As per my memory of the last visit the food is largely on the hot side but this was more my preferred spice level and absolutely delicious. Previously you could never book a table so I don‚Äôt know if this change was because it was a Tuesday night, we were a large group or due to covid but regardless it‚Äôs far more convenient.  Update My friend and I found ourselves at Longrain again but were sad to see it‚Äôs no longer in the entertainment book (which I should stop buying as I have not used it once). This is maybe the only hatted restaurant where you actually feel really full after. They don‚Äôt take bookings and you sit on communal tables but it is defintely worth it for this delicious modern Thai.  Penang curry was a tad hot luckily the cocktails are a pure delight (not to mention rather lethal) and the list is super-extensive. Order the banana leaf salmon. Do it  Original review Longrain is one of my friends favourite restaurants and whenever she is in town from interstate we tend to pay a visit. At over ten years old it was doing Asian fusion before all of the rest of Melbourne jumped on the bandwagon and it is still so iconic today that you will inevitably be waiting for a table regardless of what day it is.  I don't mind the wait so much as it has become a bit of a tradition for us to sip on a cocktail as we linger praying for someone to leave. Cocktail wise I favour the sweet fruitiness of the ping pong while my dining companion sticks to the freshness of the caiprioska. Both very tasty. I love the atmosphere which perfectly suits a special occasion or date night but works equally well for a dinner with friends (if you're friends are willing to spend up big on Thai that is).  The egg net is kind of obligatory but I personally adore the king prawns and the coconut poached chicken. So much delicious flavour it's actually insane. Do ask the waiters regarding the spice level of your chosen dishes if you can't tolerate a lot of heat because the food does tend to pack a punch (just order more cocktails). A beautiful space, seamless service and an electric atmosphere"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNjh6WE5BEAE,"10% discretionary charge for bookings over 8!!! What? An extra 10% on over a $1000, wow. Sorry for bringing in more business. This is bizarre"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd19qWlB3EAE,"Last week I had lunch at Longrain for an event. The food was amazing and the service was extremely efficient. When I left I realised I had left my umbrella under the table. I rang and spoke to a Michael or Steven (not sure) and I do realise it was only an umbrella, but he asked around and rang me back to let me know it was there. I could not get back there for over a week, but when I went in on a busy Saturday night I was advised from the lady at reception that it was upstairs and to go up and ask for Noah. I went up and Noah handed me my umbrella. Now it might have only been an umbrella, but I was amazed at how I was treated and the efficiency of everyone at Longrain. Thank you very much. I will certainly be going back there for a meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnQteEFREAE,"Another banquet $85pp booking is getting harder so do book in advance , common to see it fully Book and the options for their other locations pop up so don‚Äôt get confused . Overall the food quality was fanatic , staff very friendly , we had a birthday they held our cake in the fridge and lighted the candles for us . Overall great night . Heads up Zero parking so you will need go Up one block to find a park ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dkxucTFRRRAB,"Very tasty food. One thing that I‚Äôd change, replace chips with some good quality bread and butter ;)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bE8tbjVRRRAB,Loved the late night gnocchi and a glass of wine after going to a show nearby. Menu looked very inviting!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aUtINHZRRRAB,Perfect in every way. Relaxed attentive and food is amazing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE1PU0JREAE,"First timers and grabbing a meal before a show, so location was the key, but now we know how amazing the service and food is we will be frequent visitors/diners. Our host was fabulous and guided us through the menu and wine perfectly. We are all still telling anyone who will listen it was the BEST steak we have ever had, and the share plate was plenty enough for 3 people. Great restaurant, and I would highly recommend it for any occasion."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTdXOG1nRRAB,Lovely
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTlpbFZnEAE,"Really great ambience. Cosy yet chic.  My colleagues seemed to really like the coffee. My only gripe was the somewhat limited range of non-coffee hot beverages. I was told they didn't stock chai or similar, which tends to be a cafe staple these days. The tea I had was fine but nothing particularly memorable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdkxUOF9RRRAB,"One of the most amazing dining experiences. The food, the atmosphere, the service... Such a special place for an anniversary. Will definitely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM183bzRBRRAB,"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere - a great night out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSazhTWnpRRRAB,Always a wonderful experience. Best of Melbourne.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaHFXUlR3EAE,Amazing food and service!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNHF1RnZ3RRAB,Excellent food friendly staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaE91Z0xBEAE,"Tr√®s ordinaire! üòï This restaurant is much hyped but the service and food does not match its reputation. Firstly the service was lackluster bordering on indifferent. We had to wait ages for our first drinks and even longer for the courses to arrive. Mistakes were made with the ordering and things forgotten. We had to ask repeatedly for simple things like water to be refilled. The 250gm porterhouse steak ($52) was served on a cold plate and I had to wait for the sauce and frites to arrive while my fellow diners already had their meals. Why would a high-end establishment allow a steak to leave the pass without the accompaniments? The steak was not the delicious melt-in-the mouth medium-rare I was expecting. It was dry and chewy at one end, raw at the other end and sinewy in the middle. Very disappointing. I should have sent it back to the kitchen but really didn‚Äôt want a drama to spoil our family celebration. The desserts were nice enough but not exceptional. Overall an expensive and very ordinary dining experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobTc3NGtnRRAB,Poor service and poor staffing interest. Couldn‚Äôt find their listed wine. Just had to leave. Interstate visitor. Melbourne generally has gone to the pack. Won‚Äôt be back while it‚Äôs a socialist collective
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXFMY2x3RRAB,"Nice European style restaurant with a selection of food and drink options, mainly European choices.  I ordered the pommes frites with aioli, pecorino salad, and the gnocchi dish and all tasted delicious!  Very friendly and capable staff members and lovely tables outside...  Constructive feedback for the female toilet... It wasn't very clean when I used it, however, giving the fact that the restaurant is European - style it reminds of the European continent..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ3VyRFl3EAE,Service and food are always an absolute 10 out of 10
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobE11V1FnEAE,This shop no longer offer's different size cups for coffee's etc.. To pay in excess of $5..for a standard coffee's a rip-off..there's nothing special about it's taste..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoazRqYlRnEAE,Second time around. They always have a great selection of wines. We also particularly loved the Tongue and Escargot dish. The Bordelaise sauce that accompanied it was outstanding!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLWV5THpRRRAB,It was second time after lockdown. I think taste was lil bit different to me. More healthier taste than before. I don‚Äôt know it is good or not. Maybe my tongue has changed. I‚Äôd like to try again soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobHRHRE5BEAE,Coffee cups seem to get smaller every time I go here. No  good value.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cEtuYU9REAE,"Oh, Red Pepper, what have they done to you? This was my go-to restaurant when visiting Melbourne. Fantastic food, decent prices, and that special buzz you get when visiting a place at the top of its game. None of those apply any more. My heart is broken."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eUw3SzZBRRAB,Nicely made Indian food which had authentic tastes of all the masalas required to prepare an Indian food . Both the hosts were wonderful & took really good care of us. No hush hush during ordering & while eating was the USP of the place. Quality & taste of the Tandoori Naan ü´ì was fabulous & must try !!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScFpmdE5nEAE,"I had Bhang Chicken with a Garlic naan and was an absolute delight. On taste authenticity scale, it totally beats all the other Indian joints in CBD. I never thought I would leave a good review about a naan but it was so good too!!  Reservation process was a little sketchy but I think Sat night rush."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenJ6SWlnRRAB,Best place I ever been in cbd. Fantastic food and customer service üëçüëç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSenR5OTJnRRAB,"Food was fantastic, sarso da saag was amazing,"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXVXdUF3EAE,"The best Indian restaurant in CBD with the amazing vibe and a good food.This place has a good ambience to chill out with family, friends. If you got a chance to visit melbourne and you don‚Äôt get to go here it will be your biggest regret.Please do visit for the quality Indian food with the most affordable price‚Äôs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXJLQXFnRRAB,"All other Indian restaurants were jam-packed. We got a table in this restaurant.  It was good that we got our dinner, but after eating their food I realised the reason why their tables were available."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSM1AyMkxnEAE,I haven‚Äôt been here in a while and I ordered the goat curry. It was the best goat curry I‚Äôve had in Melbourne. Wait staff were so lovely. I will recommend this place as a must try for goat curry.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbk5uQmVBEAE,"Very tasty food, homely environment and amazing service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUxtMVVBEAE,It‚Äôs was one of my favorite place during my travel in Australia ! I tried a lot of different starters and mains ! And my favorite is the vegetable pakora with butter chicken.  Good place - Good food - Good staff - Good moment
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNUxIVEdnEAE,"If i have to recommend a restaurant, i must advice you the red pepper which is a perfect place in the CBD. The food Is absolutely excellent and the staff very firendly. It feels like home, you can go with your eyes closed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdUlXZEx3EAE,"I had heard a lot about this place through colleagues but this was my first time there. I would say I am never walking in again due to the poor service and lack of options on their menu.  Drinks - Didn't have half the drinks on their menu. After one round of Glen Fiddich, the team comes over and says they don't have anymore of the same drink. They don't have options available! Same with the beer mentioned on their menu.  Starters / Appetizers - Real poor menu if you wanted to munch on something before you ordered your main course. We ordered each of the five things (2 non veg and 3 veg dishes) on the menu. The non veg dishes arrived in 20 mins and the 3 veg dishes arrived 60 mins later, with the main course.  Staff - Kept pushing us that we had to order our main course along with the appetizers! Would not take No for an answer. They didn't even know the names of drinks on their own menu and had to keep rushing back to the bar to check if they had the drink available. When our single malt round 1 was over and they didn't have any left with them, the staff got whatever they had available, on a tray - with none of them being single malt and they kept forcing us to order something.  Mains - Would like to state that this was possibly the only thing that all 11 of us enjoyed. Some amazing dishes and the chef knew what they were cooking. The only saviour to the price we paid for the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmFMekpBEAE,Highly recommended for a pre-show meal! Very conveniently located near the theatres. We had a delicous dinner here before our show. It was quick and still relaxing. The service was friendly and very accommodating. Will return.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGRtNU1BEAE,Had a very enjoyable night here with a group of 4 friends. Tasty food and delicious naan. The servers were quite friendly and helpful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeWVMaEtREAE,"Had a reservation for 7:30pm, got there a few minutes early. Staff were walking around unsure where to seat us. Ended up seating us right next to the door, I asked if we could sit somewhere else and were told no as this was the only table set up for two people. They then proceeded to sit other groups of two at larger tables. People were walking in with bookings and were told ""we will try find a table for you"". Staff were very unorganised. Food was okay but nothing great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbllYOUZnEAE,The food is still amazing however the place has become smaller. Restrooms are on the first floor.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNnZ6eXVBRRAB,"I ordered the Kashmiri lamb and it was advertised as a medium hot dish, however it had no spice at all. It could have been an off night, but it was a little bland. Lamb was tender and the naan was good. Service was not great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZMXFxbVRBEAE,Nothing like old red pepper .  Service 0/10 takes ages for simple items to come out of kitchen .  Menu - the whole menu has been revised and only 10 % items available.  What a shame. After so many visits hate to say but last visit .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd0tTQm9BRRAB,Being a Indian cuisine restaurant the difference between dry and curry chicken is not known to the staff. If you are not sure then please check with the chef before confirming the order. Also in the menu there is no starter option but on their billing machine they have the option.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZy1IdTN3RRAB,"I recommend this place if you like real Indian food, I took a Kadhai paneer by takeaway and it‚Äôs was better than what I expected !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ183a2hBRRAB,"Perfect place to enjoy some spicy and typical food from India, I recommend you the bhang chicken it was lovely"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN2Z6RzBnRRAB,It is not a really Indian food. Only names looks like india. Please try to use Indian original spices.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaUtlZjh3RRAB,superb restaurant with typical dishes that respect traditions.  Super accessible and good atmosphere
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtZ2ZfY1B3EAE,Manager had a poor attitude
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOV9EQkxREAE,Such an excellent place for drinks
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMmVMOXBBRRAB,It's gone downhill. The main lounge is closed and the wine list by the glass is limited instead of marvellous. Go downstairs to the Wine Room or the European instead.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMThiMzVRRRAB,"Had a great night, good bar staff, active and engaging, food was on point"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURza2ZuSU5REAE,"Great sparkling wine from Yarra Valley, as a French person and a Champagne enthousiaste I really enjoy it ü•∞ The place looks like you‚Äôre in someone‚Äôs place, so the feeling of being a privileged person is here üòè You can buy yourself a cigare too ! I totally recommend this place for a date!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeTRtc01nEAE,"Supper club use to be great, food quality has gone down and service is lacking lately staff standing around talking. Supper clubs butchers board use to be amazing now just a disappointment. On the plus side polenta chips are still the go to!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzaHBDNFdnEAE,"Funny, quirky place. Not my style. It's too pretentious for my taste, but I can see how other people would enjoy it. It looks like a good place for middle-aged fancy gay men, or for straight couples on a late-night date.  The entrance isn't clearly marked, which presumably ads to the ""exclusive"" atmosphere.  It's definitely not cheap, but it has liberal opening hours, and the kitchen is open until late (like 3am or so). I only ate here once, and the food was OK.  There's better value late-night food around the corner at ""Butcher's Diner"", but people come to the Supper Club mostly for drinks and the atmosphere."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMzVlQzVnRRAB,"Best Sticky Date, must order!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaDVXZVhBEAE,"Accessed via a single unassuming timber door from the street, and pirched on a landing atop a narrow stairway, The Melbourne Supper Club boasts a classic interior with a beautiful large round window overlooking plain trees and enormous classical paintings. Burgundy paint casts a moody ambiance, lit with candles and soft lightening. The staff are highly attentive and the menu extensive, offering tapas and main options, suitable for individuals or to share. The drinks menu offers options of every kind, including wine, spirits and beer from around the world."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNmRXeFBREAE,"Great for a late night wine or an afternoon coffee. This is by far one of my favourite bars in Melbourne. Its intimate and welcoming, full of old world charm. Be sure to get a seat near their icon window over looking parliament house!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNa2V5VUh3EAE,The one saving grace is.... the polenta chips at 2am
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMHUyRHRRRRAB,Love this place great food & wine with roof top Cuban cigars
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNEplZTdRRRAB,Greate ambience and service. Thank you for excellent drink recommendations.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdmJPb2V3EAE,"Traditional style restaurant/cafe with professional waiters and quality food, wine and coffee"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcWNqYm53RRAB,Great service and great menu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4M01mVGlnRRAB,"You might think that a restaurant called Waiters would have exceptional service. In fact, this was the first restaurant I have ever walked out of in my 56 years.  I arrived at 12 for my lunch booking and was served at about 12:10. Before saying anything else, the waiter, who I think was the owner, stated that I needed to order quickly as my booking finished at 1 o‚Äôclock. I responded that I had booked the day before and had not been told there was a limited seating time. Rather than apologise or try to find a solution, he told me that I was incorrect, and that I would have been told that I had to be out by one. I politely insisted that I had not been told that I was to be out by one, and stated that if I had of been informed it was an hour booking I would not of booked as we were expecting to have a long conversation over a long lunch.  Again, he told me I was incorrect, and walked away. As he left he said ‚Äúif you decide to stay, the special board is over there‚Äù.  My lunch guest, who I had never met before, and I looked at each other, laughed and left. And luckily found a very nice Italian restaurant around the corner where we had a terrific meal with great service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX1oyUk9REAE,"It was everything I remembered from 35years ago Great simple homely atmosphere Chalkboard menu , no prices Cheeky glass of red and a fantastic meal. Osso Bucco to die for , stunning flavours and melt in your mouth meat. Chicken and mushroom fettuccine,  simple tasty and not drowned in too many flavours, Pure!!! Tasty herb bread A perfect meal. Good value and full of memories"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3BTcVF3EAE,Great pasta and quite a popular place.  I got the ravioli napoli which had amazing flavour and taste. The portion is enough to be satisfied from the meal.  Expect to spend $30 for a pasta here. I would also recommend booking in advance.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOElxZENBEAE,"Have been dining here on and off since mid-70s and first time back in over 3 years - not much has changed. Food is home style Italian done very nicely, wine is basically house selections in recycled bottles drunk from average glasses but for $35 for a bottle of very good Shiraz, not average wine. Saltimbocca cooked properly, tiramisu for dessert a lesson in how to do it authentically  - soft biscuits soaked in dry masala and a beautiful cream topping, superb.  Three courses for 3 people, including drinks, $210 which is great value. Service is excellent, atmosphere the same as always. Basic tables and chairs, chalkboard menus. Very relaxed and completely booked out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjZlbGdBRRAB,Great food and atmosphere with an interesting history. Loved it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOTdLbUVnEAE,Al dente!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaDlLUlJ3EAE,"Traditional rustic Italian food! Always busy, always consistent and the best!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWZuR1lREAE,Highly recommended for pasta & garlic bread. 5*
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNFpxbDNnRRAB,"Loved my first experience at the waiter‚Äôs restaurant, I will be back more frequently hope to see the friendly staff again and to eat your amazing food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGR6QWJnEAE,"Very engaging staff, great service and the food is like a home cooked meal. Be prepared for how popular and busy it is. Everybody is welcomed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLXI2eHZ3RRAB,"Hidden in an alleyway, up the stairs to this traditional gorgeous authentic restaurant. It was a packed dining room but service was prompt and the food was absolutely divine! You have to call to book, menu is on the chalkboard (without prices though) but  I just love how traditionally authentic the experience was - if you‚Äôre looking for a quality Italian experience, this is your place!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeXFuME9BEAE,One of the best Italian restaurants in Melbourne!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ3ZxQjdRRRAB,"Food like nonna used to cook it. Crowded, cramped, noisy but wonderful! If you like peasant Italian food you'll love it..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNktXMVNBEAE,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so high here.  They don't take bookings and when you arrive and there are empty seats you still get sent away for 30min? Waiters weren't friendly. There is no menu and everything is written on the board with no prices. The portion sizes were small and taste was sub par.  Spaghetti marinara $31.50, small in size and just average in taste.  Mushroom risotto $25.00. edible but not good.  Spaghetti carbonara $25.00 was pretty terrible. Boiled spaghetti, hardly any seasoning and a few pieces of meat... If this is their standard, it is worse than most home chefs.  I wouldn't spend any money here. There are many nice Italian restaurants in Melbourne and this is not one of them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobjZLUzNRRRAB,Delicious pasta!!! Would definitely come back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLThYQnRnRRAB,Been to Italy numerous times and had amazing meals-but Waiters stacks up with any place I've been to in Italy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMl9IVWZnEAE,lovely food ( pappardelle al funghi) and host. Thanks for having me
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocTdHc0JnEAE,Reasonable priced deliciy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocy0zRUtREAE,"Having returned to this restaurant after quite some time, I still love this place!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NVAzX0NnEAE,Needs salt.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUx2YTBnRRAB,It was delicious!! It seems like a good value for money restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OExyZXhnRRAB,"Great spot up the North end of the CBD, me and my partner are getting to as many cheap eats places as possible in the CBD, and Butchers Diner is no exception to the myth busting - you CAN get great food on a budget in the city!  We had the Cheeseburger with bacon, and a Chilli dog! The hand cut chips are so good, they were a real standout on their own right. Both dishes were smashing, and we got out of there for less than $50 for the two of us. Excellent food, and a great bustling hustle, ques of people, and tons of things happening.  Definitely headed back, and couldn't believe how good the market special was on the day we visited - aged rib eye with chips & salad for $34!?!! Crazy cheap!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN19XXzhRRRAB,"Great burgers. Nothing instagram fancy, just good quality ingredients. Good selection of craft beers too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDR2Z0lBEAE,"Wish I came a day later to try the Reuben, but the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich is was DELICIOUS!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamJybUl3EAE,"A fun, communal eatery. It is a narrow venue so wheelchair users may find it difficult to find a place. The food was fantastic and the bacon was beyond belief good. Reasonable prices."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdVlpMjlBRRAB,"Enjoyed the chilli dog and ribs, but not 100% sold on the cracked pepper gravy used on the poutine. Would still recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmJuNE9nEAE,"Simple, fresh ingredients handled with skill equates to the best burgers in Melbourne (IMHO)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMFptdFBREAE,"Cheeseburger, chips and a drink for $27 - not bad for a late night feed, cheeseburger was pretty good with the onion, tomato and pickles cutting the grease of the patty!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHVuQlhREAE,"Asked what‚Äôs good and was recommended the beef skewers, completely exceeded my expectations. Best quality meat I‚Äôve had in a long while. Short wait even at peak hour, lovely service. This meat is a reminder of how to properly respect the animals we eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3Bucll3EAE,Cool place with display of aged meat
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNU1pZ3FBRRAB,"Love going here after a late weeknight movie and yelling ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm waaalkin‚Äô here‚Äù as I cross the street to get my succulent meal provided by democracy manifest. Can‚Äôt beat it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeE9iUzJ3RRAB,Solid burger joint when you're after something that's not a restaurant or a fast food. Service was quick and the food ok at a reasonable price. Wine selection was good with half bottle options.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjhqWTZnRRAB,"Ordered the blood sausage and devilled egg roll, cheeseburger with bacon, and potato salad. All of it was excellent. Potato salad balanced out the heavy burger and roll. Bacon was so crisp. Yum!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSal9hMXhRRRAB,We ordered two sandwiches and meat in both felt overcooked and chewy. Both sandwiches were dry. Still tasty but not what I was looking forward to.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNl9UMzB3RRAB,"A good place worth to go for a quick lunch. I hang out with my boyfriend, and we order an island chilli hot dog and a small chip. The food is incredible but a little pricy for us."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScS1QYmRREAE,Delicious food and the staff were lovely too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSemQ3cENnEAE,Great place great food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGZQUERREAE,"Have been to Butchers diner a number of times pre and post COVID.  Normally I don‚Äôt leave reviews but couldn‚Äôt help to this time as my visit on Saturday 01/04 was shocking- and as a result I will not be returning.  Firstly, the staff member seemed uninterested and unhelpful and I would be understanding of this if the restaurant was busy but there was a total of 5 people at that time.  The food arrived on time but how disappointing!!  The octopus & Chinese sausage skewer was ridiculously small, the tuna skewer was super overcooked and it was difficult to tell if it was chicken or tuna- both items were totally overpriced for what we got.  The only saving grace was the blood sausage roll and chilli dog (but how difficult really is it to make one of these) and the can of hard peach iced tea.  Will not return and would not recommend!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ0tDaXZnRRAB,I paid 25+ AUD for a cheeseburger with bacon as well as a side of regular fries.  The burger patty was quite tasty but I didn‚Äôt like that it was well done. I wasn‚Äôt asked about the preferred doneness of the patty so it came out on the tough side.  The fries were EXTREMELY SALTY. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the fries at all.  I don‚Äôt think much of this place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaG8ySG13RRAB,One of the best burgers in town
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScW9qbXlBRRAB,My must stop eatery when I'm in Melbourne. Get there on a Thursday and order the ruban.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX015UlJBEAE,"This place had been in our saved list for a while, and on 18 March we finally made time to visit!  We got: ü•™ Baked French Dip Roll ($19) This was the reason for our visit, a Saturday special that Andrew was soo excited to try. Unfortunately, it was quite average. We were hoping for a beefy broth dip and melting cheese on the sandwich, but they‚Äôre lacking on both. The only good part was the roll was loaded with the beef slices which was tasty!  üç∞ Tiramisu ($12) This was good, but not great. Nice soft creamy texture but missing that coffee kick that we wanted on a tiramisu. For the price, we could get a better Tiramisu elsewhere.  ü•î Patatas Bravas (Special $16) This dish was sooo disappointing, even remembering it makes me wanna cry! For a place that highlights their meat, the meat they chose to put on this dish was very appalling. There‚Äôs no beef texture in the chili (my cat food honestly had better beef chunks üò≠), the cheese wasn‚Äôt even melted, the chips were alright but this wasn‚Äôt helping.  For a place that‚Äôs rated quite high (4.5 stars on google at the time of this review), we‚Äôre so shocked at the quality we receive. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place, but if you still want to give them a try please skip the items we got above to avoid disappointment! üò¢"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cEtYYXpRRRAB,"Food was great, service was nice, only be aware that it‚Äôs located on third floor with a tad dodgy staircase. Also heaters could have been more efficient"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSZzR5WlJ3EAE,"Really good place to go and have drinks and food with friends at any time ‚Ä¶ the staff is very friendly , ready to help you with anything, I had the best paella and sangria ever thanks to the Chefs ..really recommend to go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoODRPaWNnEAE,"It's such a beautiful place to go and enjoy having some drinks, but it's expensive and a place you need to book yourself into, not just showing up for a few and a few stairs to walk up to get to there floors."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoajhEVTJnRRAB,"Great little venue, nice atmosphere even when packed and stunning views. Wife threatened me with nastiness about halfway up the stairs to get there, so i was hoping the venue would redeem me, which it definitely didüòÇ Ordered a lime cocktail, which the bartender has never made before, so they got help from another bartender, and he was great with them, and despite the busy bar, made sure they were comfortable to make the cocktail... Wide said it was fresh and lovely! All cocktails looked kinda sweet, so I asked if they could make me a whiskey sour, which they did without question, and it was fantastic. Prices were excellent, and the vibe and view make this a return venue, Cheers"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTg3QVJ3EAE,"Nice rooftop with plenty of plants. It felt like a rooftop jungle. However, options for chic non-alcoholic (NA) drinks were basically zero. For e.g. Monday Distillery, Seedlip, NON, Lyres, Altina Wines, Heaps Normal...the list goes on.... It's 2023, and the NA demand has been growing rapidly since peak Covid in 2020, so I was quite disappointed with this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMVlTNXdRRRAB,Great spot for a drink in Summer sunshine or after dinner
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob1lYelNnEAE,Funky little hideaway.......needs misters for hot days. üòÅüëç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNkxuRXN3RRAB,"I celebrated with some drinks and food recently for my birthday at The Loop rooftop bar. It was a lovely ambiance with cool tunes. Laura the staff member made us feel welcome with her attentiveness, friendliness and professionalism. I highly recommend this venue. We also attended a comedy sketch on level 1 which was great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNod09ITk9REAE,Always good vibes and great service! The drinks were delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcV9lNFFBEAE,Venue and staff were amazing. It‚Äôs five stars from me. Favourite rooftop bar!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcS1DNzVBRRAB,"Ordered 2 drinks, the bartender short-poured the alcohol in both and the pre-mix is coloured water. Not really anything particularly good about the place. Not worth the 4 flights of stairs to visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dFlxOFZnEAE,Amazing food!! Lovely rooftop bar. Dont give 5 stars. But the food here  deserves the 5 stars! 100 % will return. And strongly reccomend  this  place.  Been three times. Now since 1st review. Food is the main reason for our visit. Best calamari we have tasted. Michelin star quality. Freindly staff and lovely cold drinks.  If visiting Melbourne this has to be 1st on the list.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbGItZjFnRRAB,"One of Melb's best rooftop bars, great staff and views, fantastic atmosphere"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcnZhbnhBRRAB,The kitchen regularly closes at 9 and the business stays opens significantly later and there is no mention of no food service closure. It doesn‚Äôt matter how stunning a place is (which it is) if they can‚Äôt state that they have no food when they are known for food and drinks it‚Äôs unacceptable. This is even more disappointing when reservations were made.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcjYtOWNnEAE,"Full marks for great customer service, amazing drinks, mouth watering food and a really speedy service. ‚ù§Ô∏è They accommodated for my extra guests on short notice and reserved a cute spot for our group on level 3. Cornelius the host is such a vibe. He is just amazing and adds to this amazing venue, he is wonderful. I don't know the French bartenders name but she is amazing too üíú  Love the botanical bar vibes and the city scapes. Thanks for everything Loop team. I'm very impressed, my birthday was a success and I surely will be back üëç"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScTV5YkFnEAE,"It always feels like a family run business here. The manager Mario goes out of his way to look after you, and the bar staff at night are fantastic. Have been coming here since 2016. Highly recommend you pop in for lunch or evening drinks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOG9TRXdnRRAB,Warm cosy place with welcoming staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSam92eFlnEAE,The food took over an hour to come out with not much attention during that time or explanation as to the delay. I saw other guests also asking about their orders. The steak was very good when it arrived.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbVBlOElREAE,"Steaks were way too salty. Seems the chef forgot how much salt he had added that a glazed salt layer formed on the faces of the steak, just like the top of creme brulee but by salt. Way overpriced for the quality of food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScUpiYXBRRRAB,"I highly recommend the scallops here since I tried from many resturants in Melbourne and found this place is the best.  It is fresh, chewy and tasty, serve with bacon. The other foods /dessert also not bad (slightly less choices than the others but all come with high quality). Staff here is freindly especially the lady name Yao. She is very helpful and hospitality/advise to customer clearly. I will visit here again when I go to Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczVhUjVBRRAB,"What a gem of a place! Peter on the bar was like an old friend, treated me brilliantly and was just amazing, he makes great cocktails too. Glen the chef was so accommodating and gave me the most amount of options to cater to my dietary requirements that I have EVER had. I selected the salmon with a medley of vegetables which was absolutely delicious.  Will I be back? Hell yes! Delicious food, superb service and staff who treated me as an old friend. What more could you ask for?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoLUtDbHVBRRAB,"We met an international visitor staying at the hotel for a quick early dinner here. The menu had good variety and our waiter was friendly. The beef burger was good, however the fish curry arrived without any fish, which was handled professionally. Compared to Melbourne's vibrant foodie scene, the atmosphere is pretty bland, but it's nice looking out onto Flagstaff Gardens."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzc2RzhRRRAB,Excellent
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMjdfMnR3RRAB,"Awesome customer service, great buffet breakfast. Will definitely go back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNHJuRjhBRRAB,Great. Looking forward to staying here in March
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbVlEaEJREAE,"My partner and I had dinner here last night.Everything was very nice-customer service 5/5,the food 5/5 and the location as well.I didn‚Äôt get the name of the woman who was welcoming us-I guess a supervisor(in black suit)-she was very hospitable!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOXRiNklREAE,"Tonight is the second time we are having dinner at HQ‚Äôs on Williams and I can say I am very impressed by the quality and taste of their dishes. All the meals very delicious. Even kids meals are of high quality. My favourite entrees were scallops and tuna tartar; main dishes: T-bone steak and duck with delicious lentils and quinoa. We are yet to try desserts, but I loved banana milkshake with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. Members of the team are passionate and caring. They made our Christmas dinner very special. Thank you all, especially Gerrill and Sky. We are so pleased that Radisson hotel has such a great restaurant onsite."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCenY2bHFBRRAB,Christmas dinner was great. They looked after my dietary requirements and I still had a delicious 3 course meal. Service was great and they showered my 4 year old granddaughter with gifts. Definitely go again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOHJlc01REAE,"Ordered the pasta with prawns and octopus, was luke warm and octopus was that tough was inedible, wagu burger was extremely greasy, partner ate 4 bites, cocktails are very nice and well priced"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNzdHdXZ3RRAB,"This is an alright place to eat. The restaurant is light, spacious and offers a fairly relaxing environment to dine in. The staff working when I visited were great fun and attentive. I had the house burger and it was big, tasty, crunched in all the right places and oozed juices where juices should ooze. The chips and side salad that came with it did their jobs very well, but probably should have bigger portion sizes. The whole meal filled me up but only because of the size of the burger üçî, not the accompanying sides. Price wise, I didn't think my food and beer was over priced and I came out of the place thinking about how I enjoyed my meal rather than its cost. That's always a good sign. I like burgers and love to try them in eateries I haven't dined in before, and this one didn't disappoint; and I'd gladly go back to HQ's and take their burger for another test drive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlXzRIcGxRRRAB,"Went there with family, friends for dinner.  I ordered the T-bone steak - medium cooked.  It after quite some time, it came out and was near raw (rare) and very difficult to cut.  I sent it back to get cooked more, and this time looked better, but was near impossible to cut and eat.  DO NOT order steak, they have no idea how to cook them. Ended up going down to Crown Casino and ate in the food court.  Much better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNWUtdkpnEAE,We are love at the Radisson hotel is the best atmosphere/ service and fantastic food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNkxYRFp3EAE,The Victorian Beef Sandwich - just perfect... Perfect....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Njl5X3hBRRAB,"Scrambled eggs and mushrooms were good, although the sausage and bacon were a but too salty for my liking. The tomato was a bit hard as well, but juicy. Potatoes were undercooked and bitter for some reason.  Service staff were generally great, especially the waiters, who were very professional and friendly. Can't say the same for the chef at the egg station, sadly. The guy disappears from his station most of the time, and seemed really unhappy and frustrated when I requested an extra over easy eggs on top of my omellete.  Worst of all, my order was missing when I went to the station to collect (and of course, he was conveniently missing as well...)! Some other customer must have taken them! Can only assume that either he lacks training in his job, or just really can't be bothered at all and is just there to collect pay check at the end of the day. Either way, left a bad impression on me in what was otherwise an above average dining experience. It takes one bad egg to ruin the entire omellete after all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cUk2cGVREAE,"$30 for a burger (pictured) not amazing.. staff are always super friendly.. we have been here about 3 times because it's on entertainment book.. otherwise not worth it.. the curry dishes are excellent though, we tried them on previous occasions and have been impressed. Think that is the specialty here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydWJ5VGpRRRAB,Very friendly service with a smile and great food. Enjoy many meals here when I stay in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyamZTTU5BEAE,"What an amazing trio of waiters tonight. All 3 of you absolutely made my night! From the wine suggestions, to the food suggestions, to the attentive personalised service and laughs. Thank you! The food was amazing... had to try the apple cucumber oyster... wow, like a fresh, sweet explosion of flavours and textures in my mouth and the Lamb was cooked to perfection. Thoroughly recommend. I wasn't staying at the hotel, however,  based on the level of service from the three of you tonight  I will be next time. It's rare to find a team so committed to making a person's evening enjoyable and memorable. You should be commended üëèüëèü•∞ü•∞"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb0k3cldBEAE,"My boyfriend and I had dinner there on a Monday night, we were expecting average restaurant and average service‚Ä¶very surprised at the amazing waitstaff and delicious food, I will never underestimate this place again!! Special shout out to waitstaff Peter, Gerrill and Luca you made it a wonderful experience for the both of us!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtel9hUm13RRAB,Always come here when staying at the Radission!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bkxTbDB3RRAB,Good Japanese restaurant. The Japanese-style deep-fired chicken is very good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDlQMFdREAE,The atmosphere and decor were very reminiscent of Japan. The ramen was amazing. This place is a hidden gem
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGQzaHB3RRAB,A little disapointed in service and price. Servings are small and a 10 percent surcharge on weekends. Food was ok but not filling for the price.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScG9XSmV3EAE,"üëçüèªüáØüáµ  This place is a hidden gem in the city! With a lovely decor reminiscent of Japanese and a bunch of anime posters like Naruto, One Piece, etc. stuck around, it's a visual treat for anime and Japanese culture lovers!  üçúüç•  The Kimchi Beef Ramen ($20.80) that I ordered was quite delicious. Personally, I'd have preferred a slightly thicker soup, but it wasn't a big issue. A lovely bowl of ramen on a wooden table, with paper lanterns fluttering overhead, a faux cherry blossom plant near the entrace made the whole experience so amazing! The menu comes bound in a wooden cover, so that's something.  The place serves alcohol as well.  üí≤üàπ  Good price range, but I felt I paid more for the experience rather than the food itself, but it definitely felt worth it and therefore no complaints. The staff were friendly, the food came in quick and I'll definitely recommend this place for a wholesome Japanese dining experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNkxDUnJBRRAB,Not the best quality but fine for what you pay for
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjcta1JnEAE,Found this place open at 9pm on Easter Saturday so stopped by for a dinner and I was craving warm soup noodles because of the rain so I got the vegetable gyoza ramen and wow did it hit the spot although my complaints are that they don‚Äôt provide proper soup spoons so I was trying to ladle soup into those recyclable wooden spoons which was way too shallow and it was impossible anyways it also took half an hour for my order to come out even though the restaurant was pretty empty so idk what was up with that
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScjRLeV9BRRAB,Tasty and delicious. I love it and will visit here again when I go to Melbourne.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSay1hcnZnRRAB,"Simple, fast and tasty! Funky environment which the kids enjoyed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2FPcjNRRRAB,"Service here was so poor, the server maybe new, but it took multiple attempts to get our order correct. The food isn‚Äôt terrible but quick and easy feed it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. It was over an hour to get the correct food sent out of the kitchen! I wish you best of luck going forward but we won‚Äôt be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMTRLTTJRRRAB,you know fast food mainly for take away for chinese students.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNl9MdnRRRRAB,"Cute fitout.  I recommend coming for the weekday lunch special - $20 for an entr√©e (takoyaki or harumaki), main (karaage or pork/chicken katsu curry with rice/udon) and soft drink. Also check Liven for further discounts (it's quite good value when one stacks both).  The alcoholic taste of the sauce on the grilled squid - I think miso and cooking sake - was a bit potent for me, but I enioyed everything else. It's good to see curry udon for a change."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobmNTS1J3EAE,"Great food, beautifully cooked. Most enjoyable. So glad we found it in the side alley. We'd definitely eat there again if we'd stayed longer. We ate delicious Ramen and Tempura."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoamVycmJREAE,If I had the choice between starving or eating food from here again I would starve any day. Probably the worst food I have had in a while
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNlpHMlZBEAE,"Very delicate, service attitude is also very good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocnBYRG5nRRAB,Authentic Japanese food in an alley way . Delicious üòã Friendly staffs & interesting decors! Love their curry üçú udon ! ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNHYzbUZnEAE,really bad taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX0ppVmFBEAE,"Food were nice but the customer service was one of the worst that I‚Äôve encountered. The rude attitude of the cashier/server with short bob hair is the reason why I‚Äôm giving 1 star.  Upon entering, she was simply just standing behind the counter staring at my family with an unwelcoming expression. Nor did she bother to greet or serve us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNElHeDVBRRAB,"Amazing atmosphere, Beautiful food and Friendly service. While waiting for my food I got lost in the immersion of the decor. Portions were above average and I definitely got my money's worth. Well satiated. If I was a permanent resident of the area, Tokyo 7 would most definitely be my most visited restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocjdfNlVREAE,Amazing place and service with good prices and delicious food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLTZMQS1nRRAB,I always ask the beef noodles. Everything is delicious and good price Congratulations
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCczQtLThBRRAB,"When I made a mistake and caused trouble, they were very courteous and helpful! Thank you :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCclk2N3V3RRAB,Great tasty food with an awesome atmosphere.  Lunch deal was excellent.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOWE2WVF3EAE,"Restaurant does not operate the hours shown on Uber eats. Waited nearly an hour of it ‚Äúbeing prepared‚Äù called the restaurant 3 times to check they were open, no answer. Please change your trading hours on Uber eats!!!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCc1pUWFFnEAE,Kind of cheap prices. Small portions for our bento. Salmon bento was okay but prawn one was not so good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNXZUSXFRRRAB,"Wonderful vibe, delicious Ramen"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdmR5MENBEAE,Ordered lechon crispy skin that it tastes more like lechon kawali. It tastes ok and the team were nice. They gave us lots of sauce and packed the food well. I have not tried dining there and not tried their other food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSczgtMHdBRRAB,"Lechon crispy pork on rice: it was not as amazing as I was expecting based off reviews. It was standard crispy pork, actually a bit dry compared to other places. Not bad, you‚Äôll enjoy it, but I took a special trip here just to try - I wouldn‚Äôt bother that much, just visit if you‚Äôre in the area & need a quick meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScVpUam1BRRAB,"It was amazing!! Food was great and everything tasted authentic! The tapa beef was lean and the sisig tasted like one of those sold in carinderias. Overall, it was amazing"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeEp6eXJ3RRAB,"Went here on a Wednesday night.  Ordered the pork skewers, they came not on a stick. Wasn't told that before ordering. So was disappointed we ordered 18 of them ! Meat was tough.  Beef tapa - the meat was tough not tender.  The sisig was good, as well as the pork belly.  Sadly they had run out of chicken the day we were there.  Was a very long wait for the food.  I'm hoping to go back oneday and give a better rating"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDRpVlhnEAE,Does not accept eftpos only cash and did not inform beforehand or no signs outside. Waited in queue and ordered and then found out they only accepted cash. Had to walk to atm to withdraw and I was in a rush.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXJuTk13EAE,Their pork delivered. Filipino-style crackling perfection!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobGRIUTJBRRAB,Quality is not worth the price. Worst filo food in AU so far.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocW9HT3dnRRAB,I've been eating at GJ's for years and they never disappoint! The BEST Filipino food ever! Keep up the good work guys! üëå ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZzVLcDNnRRAB,"It's average food and a little pricey, better off going to the Japanese next door in my opinion."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdUs3QUpBEAE,Limited menu. Authentic Filipino meats. Grilled pork. Grilled chicken. Flavoured rice. Don‚Äôt expect any/much green veggies. :)  Friendly staff. Can be very busy.  Basic decor.  Can be hard to find. It‚Äôs down a laneway and does not have obvious signage.  We have been many times as a family and also with friends and relatives.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNWF1UmtBRRAB,This place got good customer service‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶ their food is not. Their tapa was horrible taste but the pork grill was admirable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOXZtQzRRRRAB,"This was my first time trying Filipino food and I‚Äôve been missing out! Everything was amazing. Their menu has about 10 items on it.  The lechon was extremely crispy and super fatty, just the way I like it. The garlic rice that you can get on the side compliments the pork so well. The lechon sisig was perfectly balanced and tasted phenomenal.  The sinigang salmon belly reminded me of canh chua. It was sweet and sour - perfectly balanced!! The salmon belly was cooked to perfection and they were really generous with it.  I can‚Äôt wait to go back. I wanted to try their skewers but they sold out by the time we got there. Highly recommend trying this place out if you haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a bit tricky to find - you‚Äôll need to find an alleyway along Frankliin St and/or A'Beckett St."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlLVBlOWVREAE,"Took quite a while to locate the shop. Its inside a building, through a lane. Ordered take away their star -Lechon with garlic rice and sisig. Then the surprise. They accept ONLY CASH. Have to go round the corner to atm cash. Hope the food don‚Äôt disappoint."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb0tfa0d3EAE,Went here during a trip to Melb and left very satisfied. The lechon was juicy and tender on the inside and on the outside the skin was so crispy and airy like chicharon. It came with their homemade lechon sauce which paired well with the meat. We also had the bbq chicken which was cooked perfectly and had great flavour. Already planning to come back whenever I'm in Melb again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGFMMWZREAE,"Easily the best pork sisig, and lechon I've ever had in my life... Just visiting Melbourne this is a meal that I'll never forget, and will make sure to come by as often as I can."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LWVYb1NBEAE,Absolutely delicious food! It's a tiny little place in a lane with not much seating. Friendly staff who told us about each dish before we ordered. Will be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cXFMbm1RRRAB,"Asked if the taste and smell of the pork is normal like the one they served me, it tasted sour and smelled weird, told me that I‚Äôm the only one who complained after all the people they have served and they are confident that nothing is wrong with it, but refused to smell or taste the pork they served me. Even my friends tried the pork and they said something was wrong with it. I was looking around and even the other table didn‚Äôt finish the food. Couldn‚Äôt handle a complaint"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bnJ1bkRBEAE,"One of the best crispy pork i‚Äôve had. Crispy skin, moist on the inside, fatty, sinful but satisfying. The gravy it came with balanced the flavours of the pork. And to top it all,  fast and friendly service from the ladies who served me today."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eEp6UVVBEAE,yum!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdTRydndRRRAB,"the last time we tried to eat there, I was with my cousins who were visiting from Sydney, the old lady with short white hair terrorised us. she was so rude to us, she raised her voice and looked at us glaringly. Unbelievable experience, never going back there again. Anyone reading this I suggest just go to Cebu Charcoal Belly in Sunshine ‚Äúsobrang babait nila dun‚Äù 100% ang customer service!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMEplUnVnRRAB,Tasty sisig. Gave me a  taste of home. Lechon kawali is crunchy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSczd2dmRREAE,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Diner on Franklin, a Korean restaurant that left a lasting impression on me. The first thing that struck me was the great value for money that the restaurant offered. Their Babsang, which includes a variety of dishes for just $25, was a feast for the senses. The portions were generous, and the range of flavors was simply delightful.  One of the standout dishes that I tried was the soft tofu and seafood soup. It was incredibly amazing - the broth was flavourful and the seafood was fresh, making for a delicious and hearty soup that left me feeling satisfied and content. The dish was also beautifully presented, with a colourful array of ingredients that made it a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.  The staff at Diner on Franklin were also a highlight of my visit. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, they were welcoming and attentive. They were knowledgeable about the menu, and happy to offer suggestions and answer any questions that I had. Their service was truly excellent, and made for a memorable dining experience.  Last but not least, I have to mention the Korean fried chicken, which was simply amazing. The chicken was perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and very juicy. The flavours were bold and delicious, making for a truly satisfying and enjoyable meal.  Overall, my experience at Diner on Franklin was excellent. From the great value for money to the incredible food and top-notch service, I highly recommend this Korean restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and memorable dining experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzdXNUOGhnRRAB,The food is somewhat a bit sweet for me. Well presented tho
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMGF1dEV3EAE,"Been here many times, even since their restaurant was called bebu near RMIT and only writing a review now. Yummy! I like their fried chicken and salad! Also their soft tofu soup which isn't spicy. Overall, I would say this Korean restaurant has a more modern-australian x korean taste / vibe to it!  The restaurant is small, I would recommend going during less busy hours"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXF2QXhRRRAB,It was so delicious from the main to the side dish. Strawberries üçì From the tops cut off to the neatly placed rice cakes. I think I have to express that I put my sincerity into the food. I had a really good meal that warmed my heart. I will visit again next time!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX09hb2lnRRAB,If you have to eat cold noodles with kimchi rolls in Melbourne...... It's definitely here ......... It's so delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDhYNE13EAE,"Quite disappointed in the service of this place. Was very excited to try after seeing reviews, although after waiting 20 minutes we were told we had to wait outside with our pram which we did. Another 10 minutes go by, and a single diner had arrived behind us, the lady had given her a seat within 2 minutes without saying anything to us while we were still waiting. There was a table big enough to fit our group of 4 by adding another chair, and us putting our pram to the side, but she chose to seat a single person instead. Very disappointing service and will definitely not be returning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDduMzhRRRAB,"I am quite sad that we missed out on eating here. I had my daughter in her pram along with 3 family members waiting patiently for 20 mins and when we finally got to the front of the line, the hostess only asked us to get out of the doorway to wait outside in the cold and did not acknowledge us regarding how many people to seat. We waited a further 10 mins watching the hostess not clear a table that could have seated us and it wasn‚Äôt until another patron who was alone and lined up behind us that she cleared the table and greeted said patron friendly and seated them. She could have said maybe she was waiting for a bigger table for us but she said nothing and didn‚Äôt even smile at us. We felt invisible. After this experience, I don‚Äôt have the heart to return even with all the positive reviews."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodWJIWUd3EAE,"A small intimate place serving excellent Korean food. It is run by a couple who work efficiently and effectively so everything runs smoothly.  I can see the passion and care they put in every meal.  Food tastes amazing and service is great. We came for lunch and ordered the set meal, which comes with rice, side dishes, fruits and a mini cheesecake. Definitely going to come back to try other things on the menu.  Super recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcjhmZzRBRRAB,Super nice and worth for money!!! But I left my jacket in your shopüò≠ Can you keep it for me? I will go and grab from you. Thank you. Instagram: von_ng322 ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNWNLX0hBEAE,Simple and very well priced Korean restaurant and takeaway. I am never disappointed when I come here.  The Babsang set is the definite pick of the menu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXI2YS1RRRAB,"Delicious and generous. We ordered take away and were blown away at how generous the portions were. Our 3 year old enjoyed the japchae,  while the rest of us left satisfied. Thank you for the delicious food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMDdQYmtnRRAB,"Fantastic value.  We got the set meal with bulgogi beef and fried chicken.  The bulgogi was tender and marinated and pared well with the rice. The fried chicken was crispy, tender and juicy and in a nice sweet-chilli sauce.  The sides were plentiful and very nice. Notable sides included the cauliflower, the rice cake, the fried food and the cheesecake.  Both meals were $25, which is great value for the amount of food you get and the taste of food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN3ZYRFVnEAE,Worst experience ever.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMU1iQzhRRRAB,the lunch set was worth the 19 dollars
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaU91S1lBEAE,Good taste and good quality. Worth the price compared to other places!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbzVLZUpBEAE,the food was so delicious and filling!! I will definitely come back many times! Quite affordable too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtaFBYRWN3EAE,Delicious bentos at a reasonable price. Reccomended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlXzVLdUlREAE,"Been here many times - service and food always excellent! Delicious and generous portion, definitely leave the place full and happy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcXAzQUVREAE,"I visited often during my stay in Melbourne for the month of September, and every time everything on the menu was excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMzZlVTBnRRAB,Yummy üòò ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjctMGJnEAE,Delicious food! Took a while to prepare but was worth the wait!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNFpDY013EAE,"The babsang is so worth the money! All the side dishes were delicious, and so was the main dish I picked, which was the cheese buldak. The chicken was crispy and well coated with the sauce, and the amount of cheese on top was in no way stingy. The tofu seafood soup was a bit too salty, but when you eat it with rice it's alright. Portion was very filling as well, highly recommend eating here!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlanJudEF3EAE,We got 2 meals with ( KFC Fried Chicken sweet and chilli and beef bulgogi) the side dishes were just good 7/10. the main dishes are good as well I give them 8/10. We also have corn cheese 9/10 so yamm. Reasonable price ! The service is simple as it‚Äôs small restaurant. Overall experience 8/10. Definitely I recommend it and I will come back to try other dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSazlHbDlnRRAB,Chicken does not taste fresh anymore
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWR6VXVnRRAB,Good food and good service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1oyeGxRRRAB,Taste 9/10 best Korean Fried chicken place in Melbourne I reckon
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc1pqckxBEAE,"If Buza Chicken team is not happy to serve after 9:50 pm , pls make your working hours till 9:50pm rather than 11pm. I got all they way from Northern suburb to have it, they never served when i got into the restaurant at 9:53. Very disappointing service !!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSd3F6WDdnRRAB,"Awesome chicken, was nice and crunchy with a good sticky coating of the sauce. Would recommend anyone visiting the area that loves Korean chicken. Will definitely be back when im next in Melbourne"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocS1TMldnEAE,"Wonderful meal, quantity was amazing, service was efficient and food was very tasty and keenly priced. Well worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoczVLdzhnRRAB,"Honestly one of the best korean restaurant in city! The famous crunchy chicken , amazing. Smoke soy chicken , define. The spicy seafood soup with udon is a must!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocVlQMVBnEAE,"Amazing food!!! 12/10 food! We ordered so much that we couldn't see the table all night! üòÇ We had a booking of 11 people, it was a super fun energy, but quite a tight fit and not the most comfortable for a large booking. If booking with a large group, I would perhaps try to arrange multiple tables across a bigger area,or just be prepared to cozy up to your friends! We had a blast. Super easy to order. Staff accommodating with split bills. Friendly environment and again, 100% food quality! highlights of food to me was the bulgolgi, the snow chicken and sweet spicy chicken. Will definitely be returning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc1pDQ25nRRAB,"Meh food, slow service and just normal korean fried chicken‚Ä¶who else still charge $0.50 for each take away containers these days??"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeU1ldkdBEAE,"We enjoyed the boneless snow cheese fried chicken and kimchi pancake. However, we do not recommend Japchae - it tasted bland. Noodles were sticking together and the texture was a little plasticky. (We ordered the vegetable Japchae, sadly it only came with onions and a few shredded carrotsÔºâ 2023/02/23"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzdISnZnRRAB,Soy sauce (smoke) flavor is the best. Cheese flavor with crispy chicken is good as well. Tteok bok ki with spicy level 1 is hot enough and incredible. Just love everything we ate.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX195VHBnRRAB,Waited 1hr and 15 mins for just half chicken after asking they said 5mins then waited more 20mins I never reviewed any place but this is too much worst experience ever
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLThYQjBRRRAB,"Buza Chicken is an international Korean Fried Chicken restaurant serving dishes inspired by street food found at Hongdae Food Street and Night Market. They've got heaps of unique flavours and marinate their chicken for 12+ hours!  - Crunch King (mild) [$23] - This is a new item on their menu and apparently the no.1 fried chicken in Korea! It was crunchy and juicy, but the best part was the seasoning - COCONUT AND HONEY!!! So unique! We got the mild version, and it was slightly sweet and very delish! I think the spicy version would be bomb af too! This was our favourite dish of the night - Soy Smoked Chicken $201 - Smokey and caramelised - so yum! I've always preferred bone over boneless when getting Korean Fried Chicken. I just think it's so much juicier! - Spicy beef ribs [$37] - The slow cooked ribs were s000oo tender and flavorful! The meat just fell apart (see my stories). The serving is huge and enough to feed 4. A little spicy though - Rose Tteokbokki for 2 [$28] - Another huge serving of tteokbokki w/ glassnoodles and toppings in a very creamy and spicy sauce  I had heard lots of great things about this place and can confirm the food here absolutely slaps! The place is a vibe and the staff are so friendly, making the whole dining experience so much better. I'd definitely come back!  Follow me on insta @ evelineeats for more food content and reviews"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNVlhZGhRRRAB,The food here is amazing. A lot of variety to choose from. The staff is really sweet and polite and the service is fast. Impeccable taste with option to have different level of spiciness. I will surely be visiting this place again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeWVYUFpREAE,"Lovely environment, yummy food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob1pIblVBEAE,Authentic Korean meals.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLXVTWk5REAE,"I was here last night on what I think was a first date üòÖ and it was very busy (it was a Friday night so, I guess this is to be expected). My only complaint is that all the tables were so close together and it was very loud. Hard to have a conversion at an acceptable level. Other than that, the service was prompt. You could either order with a waiter or scan a code to order through that. We got a jug of Pale Ale that came out with the side dishes and a half and half boneless chicken of 'hot' sweet and spicy chicken and smokey soy chicken. The smokey soy was absolutely delicious!! I would recommend. The 'hot' sweet and spicy was good as well but wasn't as hot as I would like. The chicken itself was still crunchy while being lathered in sauce. Was a really nice texture. I'd probably come here again. I didn't take any photos as I was quite engaged with my 'date' but the serving size was quite large. We didn't even eat it all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX0ltNTJ3RRAB,"A place I went to because I wanted to eat Korean food. It tastes similar to Korea. The corn cheese was delicious, and it was nice to have chicken radish and cabbage salad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OEtTVVRREAE,I ordered take away Which wasn't crispy anymore when i got home. I ordered the spring onion flavour Which i am not sure what's the right way to eat it? Initially i Thought it will be battered with the spring onion flavoured sauch But that wasn't the case.  So Based on that i can't give a 4star. But i better try dine in in the future to be fair. Its nice to have some pickles and salads when dinning in to go with the fried chicken.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2MyT2FnEAE,"üëçüèªüêî  Pretty delicious Korean fried chicken is served here in a variety of flavours at great prices! The although the place looks bigger from outside, it's a bit small, with about 4-5 tables only.  üçóü•ò  The Soy Garlic Chicken (boneless, half plate 250 g, $19) with a bowl of rice ($3) made for a delicious dish. Although, on receiving my food, I felt that the rice wasn't necessary because the chicken was in really good quantity and had fries and bit of salad on the side.  The chicken was very well made. It was mixed well with the soy garlic sauce, but wasn't drenched in it, which was good. Soft, succulent and balanced in flavour the chicjen was quite good. The garlic wasn't overpowering at all, and the sauce made eating the rice easier.  The potato fries looked cute and tasted even better. Had I known about it, I wouldn't have ordered the plain rice with a few seeds of nigella sprinkled over the top.  üî§üßçüèª  Tha place could do with a little bit of cleaning an visual lift up. The cafe looled cool, but the water glass, jug looked worse for wear. The staff, although friendly, felt a bit aloof. Why there were no tissues on the tables is unknown to me.  üõçüòã  A good enough place to visit to address your fried chicken cravings on Queen Street. Also, using the EatClub app gave me a hefty 30% off on dining in!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDZET3d3RRAB,"food : - soy garlic chicken (üåü8/10) - tteokbokki (üåü8.5/10)  ambience : cozy with some great music on the background (9/10)  The tteokbokki is a little bit spicy even though I ordered the mild version. Chicken is tender, potatoes fries are always the best, however the sauce lacks umami flavour a bit. Food came out really late, we have to wait for 30mins. Maybe the lack of staff kind of making everything slow down. Overall, great food to enjoy with family or friends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMWU2QUtnEAE,"I recently visited ABC Chicken restaurant, and while the food was decent, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the customer service. The staff seemed disinterested and unapproachable, and it took a long time for my order to arrive.  To improve their customer service, I suggest that the staff be more welcoming and friendly towards customers. They could greet customers with a smile, offer assistance with the menu, and check in on customers throughout their meal. It would also be helpful if the restaurant had a system for tracking orders, to ensure that customers receive their food in a timely manner.  Regarding the food, I think ABC Chicken could benefit from using higher-quality ingredients and ensuring that the dishes are prepared consistently. The flavors were good, but the presentation could be improved by paying more attention to plating and garnishing. Additionally, the restaurant could offer more vegetarian and vegan options to cater to a wider range of dietary needs.  Overall, with a few improvements in customer service and food quality, I believe ABC Chicken restaurant could become a go-to spot for delicious food and excellent service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbGNPYV93RRAB,"For my first experience, I just say the food was ok. I will Coke back ans try other dishes soon. The chicken could have been seasoned a little more and the sauce could have been a bit thicker. Kimchi Pancake was delicious (forgot to take a photo). Portion size could have been a bit bigger too. More chicken, less potato üòú Staff was nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWRDbnZBRRAB,"If you‚Äôre paying with liven (especially with the foodollars), make sure to ask and check first whether their system is working or not. As when I was about to pay my order with liven foodollars, the lady at the cashier kept saying that their liven system is off. It was quite late at night so I couldn‚Äôt reach liven support and I‚Äôm in a rush to catch my tram so I paid in full. Got answered by liven and they tried to help me by contacting the merchant, which is ABC. Waited for a week for them to get back to me, but in between those days, liven support consistently giving me updates and in the end, they couldn‚Äôt do much about it as the payment is made through different channel other than liven - I used debit card at that time. So I tried contacting ABC as it would be easier between liven and ABC to sort this out on their side, because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to have customer bear the mishap because there‚Äôs an error happening between the merchant partners. Very hard to find way to contact them, could only message them through the google map chat (as I‚Äôm sending the receipt and the conversations I had with liven support), was not responded until I had to chat them again.. was told gonna be replied once they‚Äôre not busy, but receive no follow up until asked again.. said gonna be giving me news after they got answer from liven. And it‚Äôs been more than 2 weeks now since I contacted ABC, with no follow up - pretty disappointing - as actually the restaurant received the money and they could‚Äôve worked it out with liven to validate my liven foodollars that I should‚Äôve been able to use, or give some refund/voucher or those sorts - but no solution of compensation given to assist the customer for their systems error. For the food itself, we had to wait an hour for the sweet chilli chicken to arrive, and 10 mins after that for the carbonara - starving. Taste wise, it‚Äôs good although the chicken pieces in the carbonara that time was served into very small pieces so you get more of the coatings than the real chicken piece and felt a bit dry. The servers that served us was generally nice, but could be hard to call because they rarely stay on upstairs.. and forgetting simple things at times, like the glasses for the water/alcohol. Went here a couple times before, but this last experience was not so pleasant that makes me reconsider to visit this place again or not."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMmJLX3NBRRAB,Great food and quick service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSanNtZUFnEAE,"Food wise, it was rather mediocre. Ordered carbonara chicken as it was the popular thing there, the sauce was more like a bland bechamel sauce.  Honey soy garlic chicken was ok, just a bit small portion wise.  Service was rather slow, but potentially cause it's a public holiday and other places are closed, which might have made it more crowded?  All in all, it was rather disappointing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeHFDRWR3EAE,So much sauce is offered on the fried chicken.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbHNYYk9BEAE,"Really good fried chicken with lots of different flavors to choose from. Decent portion sizes, great food for sports night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHRDUWp3RRAB,It was really delicious ‚ó°Ãà It's been a long time since I've had chicken in Korea!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3FmN0h3EAE,They dont know what are there inside?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3NtNENREAE,The chicken was simply delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMy0zZjNRRRAB,Ordered for a takeaway at 7.50. Arrived couple minutes early and was asked to come back later. Waited another 15 minutes and treated badly by the reception staff. Will never return
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzZMVmdnRRAB,"Food so good I forgot to take photos for the review before we started eating. Amazing little place with a bang for its buck. Definitely try the soft shell cold noodles and any of the fried chicken. You will not be disappointed with this place, especially if you go with a group of friends!  A must try!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1l6SVVREAE,"Sadly, we weren‚Äôt too satisfied with our meal here. The fried chicken was good, but the other dishes we ordered lacked flavour and overall quality. The rice was hard and rubbery as if it were days old which also off putting. Unfortunately not very worth the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScm9lTEdnEAE,"I was disappointed!!! I had dinner in this restaurant but staff said I have to move out from the restaurant within 5 minutes because their table are full booked. Moreover,  staff didn‚Äôt inform anything for us about the other reservation in advance.  For replying your answer, you should tell customers no labtops allowed then. Moreover, you answered that you allowed us 3 hours for sitting in your restaurant, you don‚Äôt need to tell us in advance. But why you serves us 1800 ml beers and more beers as we want after we sat almost 3 hours, then tell us have to get out within 5 mins. No worries. We have the same direction that will not go back to your restaurant again. Thank you for our last meal in your restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGFUd1ZREAE,Not bad
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdnM2OHFnRRAB,"Yesterday my wife and I went to eat chicken for the first time in a while, but again we were disappointed. I've been here since the first time it opened, so it's a pity to see the store go bankrupt like this.  The store is very dirty and messy. There were foreign substances on the tables and chairs, so I didn't feel good from the first time I sat down. I didn't want to touch the menu board because it was dirty. As soon as I sat down, he quickly explained that there was nothing on the menu, but it was so fast that I couldn't understand it, so I called to ask again, but the staff didn't even come because they were picking up and eating among themselves. In the end, I had to stand up several times and ask. As soon as I sat down, I put the water bottle on the table, but they brought the water cup and basic snacks a while later. Is it because there are a lot of people like me who don't order? If you run it like this, there will be no more people coming and going.  Overall, no one is in control. It's not like the store has been around for a year or two, but it's amazing that there aren't that many items at once. Are you unprepared because you don't want to sell? Even if you understand the other items, it's a chicken shop, but shouldn't you prepare enough chicken?  Seeing comments on recent reviews, you're only making excuses. Are you tired? Then close the store and rest at home. Don't do business like this.  There are a lot of Korean stores these days, so if you go there, there are many stores with good service. Don't waste your time here, I recommend going to Ktown or somewhere else."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3I3ZTVBRRAB,"so many bad reviews. please don‚Äôt waste your time or money, I was really disappointed, sat down but left after 5 mins.  Edit: as a business that‚Äôs been around for years, I‚Äôd presume you would understand that running your shop would have more to do with just the food.  If you‚Äôd like me to elaborate on why you received a one star - your service standard for your staff should be improved.  you sat us down, the seats were very dirty. I couldn‚Äôt even sit down on one of them. a staff put water on the table, no cups or plates, what‚Äôs the point to even put the water there if I can‚Äôt pour anything.  my husband tried asking you guys many times, but the only two staff on the floor were chatting and ignoring him, making him get up many times.  another things is, we couldn‚Äôt order 80% of the menu and lost our appetite.  it‚Äôs disappointing since we both work in hospitality for a long time and wanted to enjoy some food after work.  I know your business has been struggling, which is why I don‚Äôt like to leave a bad review, but i have to be honest, things really need to be improved.  i have only left good reviews on my account because there is a standard in Melbourne that every business should be following. if you have this many bad reviews, maybe it‚Äôs time to start changing some things."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNjd6eXFBRRAB,"I couldn't eat the chicken radish because it tasted weird. Next time, I hope that chicken radish will be improved so that you can eat it deliciously with chicken. Chicken was very tasty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodFlUaGV3EAE,"Order was 1 hour late from the scheduled pick up time. I had to wait in the store for the food to come out and I wasn‚Äôt informed beforehand. Very slow, not happy with the service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaG9lTWRBEAE,took so long for food to come out
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaHZ1QUdnEAE,Very slow service. The waitress ignored me when I tried to call for them most of the time. Would never eat here again. Such a waste of time and money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHZETkZ3EAE,The fried batter is crispy and the soy garlic is so delicious! I ate deliciously :) I'll go again next time!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4clBPTmx3RRAB,Great vegan options
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDdDQUZ3EAE,"Vegetarians rejoice! I came to Patsy's with pretty decent to high expectations and was blown away by the wine selection, the service, friendliness, and knowledge of the staff, and last but not least, the amazing food that was on offer.  There wasn't a single thing we ordered that we didn't love (I think the shallot tarte tatin was favorite of the night).  The only thing I could maybe critique was the wording of the menu since I felt like I had to google every third word (which probably speaks more to my own ignorance than anything else)  In any case, would highly recommend and return!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdHMyOVBnEAE,"Service at Patsy's was some of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. The ambience was great, and so was the wine selection.  Food wise, I was a bit disappointed. Overall, it felt like the meals were oily and too salty, which is a shame considering the amazing textures that each meal provided.  I wouldn't personally go back, but if you are after a vego/vegan friendly restaurant with great vibes, check out Patsy's"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHNiS3Z3RRAB,"A rather unique vegetarian restaurant with an extensive range of drink options. The vibe and service by staff were fantastic. Their courtyard is beautiful and so are the interior decor, cutleries, plates, tables etc., I can really see they paid much attention to details.  I've ordered a 3 course meal banquet and overall I am satisfied. However, I think the dishes were more on the bland side and there was no 'it' factor considering the price tags There is definitely a room for improvement, and hence a 4 star rating for food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMk1Mcld3EAE,"Such a good spot. Came here for cocktails and wine before dinner elsewhere, and ended up working our way through the menu of food. Super interesting and good vibes, need to make it the final destination next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbjQycVdnEAE,"Came in for a quick snack and drink, and was really impressed. Gorgeous fit-out and nice ambience, delicious food for what we did try, and great wines with well-informed staff to guide you through the list.  Confusing lay-out for the wine list, though. Stuff listed by the glass were not actually available with random circles and lines to indicate what might be available. Made for an annoying back and forth to order a glass of wine. Otherwise a really great experience - will be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSckpLZ0N3EAE,Delicious cocktails. Even better food. We had the 4-course banquet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMVB5eU5nEAE,"Drinks were ok, should be nice to try it as the happy hour time for half price.  Food is quite so so compared to its price and portion  Only one waitress was quite good, the rest was quite cold  Nice ambience though"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeE1yY21nRRAB,"Absolutely delicious food. One of the best vego restaurants in Melbs. Great service, amazing wines."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDdXelpnEAE,Some really great cocktails here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX2FxSV9RRRAB,"We had a fixed menu. It was absolutely delicious, and the staff were friendly and attentive. We're looking forward to our next visit!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1anRtaTd3RRAB,Great place for a relaxed catch up
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNFlYZ3JBRRAB,Of course we are going to rate this five stars
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodnV5OS1nRRAB,"Beautiful food, carefully prepared and served by friendly wait staff. Best dinner out for years!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbi1LdmlRRRAB,"Wine was nice but food was disappointing. We had a savoury pastry dish, and side potatoes which was nice and asked for another main recommendation from the waitress, she recommended another pastry dish (we weren't aware) then brought out another side of potatoes when we actually ordered the sauteed vegies side. The place itself was cosy but definitely a bit over priced for what you get for mains."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocXV1MGtRRRAB,"10/10 experience. Amazing food that reminded me of my Italian Nonno's cooking. Honestly one of the tastiest restaurants Ive been to in awhile. Reasonably priced for what youre paying for, incredible atmosphere (felt like I was in a little tucked away restaurant in Europe), customer service was perfect and the vegan options were incredible! As someone who has worked in hospitality for almost 10 years, Id say this is one of the best restaurants in Melbourne."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoejZqaUJnEAE,"Thanks for NOT being vegetarian Italian and just doing the usual lazy mushroom pasta and eggplant lasagna. Great menu, good service, solid drinks, nice fit out. Well done üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoZ3FuQXV3RRAB,Just home from dinner with my Mum. Delicious! Can't wait to go again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCazRlNGpBRRAB,"Wow ! Absolutely delicious food, amazingly prepared and a paradise for vegetarians. The drinks are equally good. I had a mocktail and it didn't just taste like soda / fruit juice. Such a great find !"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbWNEQXBnRRAB,"Absolute gem. Innovative menu which blends superbly traditional techniques and modern combinations, Mediterranean/Italian/French influence. Exquisite local produce, and meat free menu. Makes ‚Äúvegetarian‚Äù restaurants look like they‚Äôre in a different league. Wine list, definitely award winning potential, and our host out in the courtyard that night was straight out of a Michelin star restaurant, just lovely, super knowledgeable and hospitable. Go there, dine there, and much love to the team."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM3VHMk9REAE,"The service is excellent, was very  helpful and knowledgeable. Food is amazing, great seasonal menu, good choices. Atmosphere is really cozy and inviting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNXN5VWd3RRAB,"We stopped in that way past to grab a drink, ended up staying for an hour and a half. We already had dinner plans, but enjoyed some cocktails, wine, and snacks.  The menu for food looks amazing and will definitely be back! In particular enjoyed the house, Negroni, and can recommend the washroom and cheese. Enjoy!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNW9TbDRBRRAB,Wow! Just wow! Too enthralled in the food and enjoyment of it all to take photos! Certainly one for the memory bank. An amazing restaurant providing delicious food (that happens to be vegetarian). We took the hassle out of choosing and went for the set menu (that didn‚Äôt disappoint). The drinks menu was extensive and the non-alcoholic cocktails were also divine‚Ä¶they cater for everyone! The service was great for wines as well. Parking is/was the only challenge but worth a blocky or two to find a spot. Enjoy everyone!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNFlhVXlRRRAB,So impressed by this menu. Food was fancy and delicious and very vegan friendly! Will certainly go again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUxIVlBnEAE,Best egg tarts in Melbourne. Hope more dish options and varieties to be available in the future.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eUxhWmRBEAE,Attentive service and a filling meal!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4d0pMZFRnEAE,"Peking duck, but make it BOUJEE! Chinese cuisine in the CBD and they also do yumcha for lunch!  We tried: ü¶Ü 1/2 Peking Duck w/ Sauce & Pancakes üç≤ Duck Rack Soup üçö Fried Rice w/ Black Truffle üêΩ Sweet & Sour Pork üçó Sizzling Chicken Wing Pot ü•£ Boiled Sea Cucumber w/ Millet Porridge ü¶Ä Crabmeat Seafood Ball w/ Cucumber Sauce  The interior of this place was really nice and boujee with intimate booth areas to dine in and a nice space to watch the chef cut and prepare the peking duck. We ordered the half peking duck set, which came with 8 pancakes, dipping sauce and veg, and a huge bowl of duck rack soup that could feed a family. The duck was juicy with crispy skin and they were quite generous with the serving, but would have liked some more pancakes to wrap. The soup was a little too mild in flavour for our liking. Loved the truffle fried rice, very fragrant! The sweet and sour pork was super crunchy, with a yummy glaze, however it was served on a bed of ice, which kept the crispiness, but it meant a few of the pieces were ice cold üòÇ The chicken was juicy and tender and flavoured well. We tried their new menu item - boiled sea cucumber with millet porridge. It was a nice warm, comforting dish with mild flavours, but pleasant. Their crabmeat ball was very squishy, with crunchy water chestnut bits throughout, in a cucumber soup. The soup had a very distinct fresh cucumber taste, an interesting mix of flavours."

We got to see the peking ducks being roasted in a wood fire oven at the front as well as the chef slicing it. I liked how each table is separated in booths which felt cosy and private but it's also slightly hard to catch staff attention. Orders are made via a QR code. We went on a Saturday and it was fully booked.  Overall good experience and a lovely time spent - would go again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdG9ITkdnEAE,"Wowee this hidden gem is top quality! We came on a Monday night and from the outside you can‚Äôt see in but once we walked in, it was jam packed! Each table has their own little alclove so it‚Äôs great for privacy.  What we ordered: üçóHalf duck (which comes with pancakes, sauces, veg and a side of deep fried duck rack) ü•ü Chinese cabbage dumplings ü•í Cabbage stir fry with dry shrimp and vermicelli üçñSweet and sour pork scoop üçó Sizzling chicken wing pot ü•ü Steamed duck bun  The sweet and sour pork scoop came on ice - we‚Äôd never seen this before yet it was such a cool concept. The pork still remained warm  but was paired with fresh fruits.  The sizzling chicken wing pot is a must order. The chicken was just melting off the bone. The dumplings were both colourful (which was fun) and very tasty.  And the duck (their specialty) was delicious! It was cooked exactly how it should be - crispy outside and tender on the inside. It was very enjoyable.  Highly recommend for those who enjoy duck / trying some new concepts!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMnJpdEdREAE,"***It is so interesting to see after my 1 star review there were heaps of 5 star reviews popped up. It also intrigues me that those 'reviewers' only have 1 review, and happens to be for this restaurant.***  Please, if this restaurant genuinely wants to improve, do pay attention to the quality of you food and service and do actively listen and understand your customers, rather than doubious business practice to glorify your brand and reputation.  Extremely disappointed with the quality of their food. Ordered spring roll. It was still cold inside. Ordered sticky rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaves. Again the rice was uncooked and the replacement was cold inside. The braised abalone with potatoes was ordinary.  Nice ambience and service was attentive."

The room even have a private toilet so no risk of getting lost after a few drinks!  The facilities are new, clean and comfy.

The Salmon could‚Äôve been cut smaller and served more chilled as it did end up tasting like a very different dish. The Chinese Doughnuts weren‚Äôt soft enough to really soak up the delicious juices from the dish. The Duck skin was just short of crispy. Nothing was a huge dealbreaker, we will definitely be back to try more as we understand large events can of course effect the quality presented.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNmJQaklBEAE,"‚ÄúFirst we yum, then we sing!‚Äù ‚Äî Who jumped to conclusions when they saw this cheesy slogan? I confess that I did üòÖ Biases were quickly set aside however, when the first bite of the ginger-beetroot cured salmon revealed some serious culinary skills from the kitchen.  Yum Sing House is modern Asian. There is the usual refined plating, smaller √† la fine dining portions, occasional deconstruction of the well-known into its elements, and rebirth in a different form (take bubble tea as cake for example). But Yum Sing‚Äôs take on fusion from ex-Longrain and -Mamasita Chef Aiven Lee and team is more thoughtful than that.  Consider the Teochew-style mussels. The use of preserved vegetables to add tang to seafood is the oldest trick in Teochew cooking, but here the concept is turned on its head. Pickled mussels are dished with a variety of fresh tomatoes. Youtiao, usually eaten whole or cut into medallions, are sliced laterally here to be used like crostini.  Then there is the classic Italian figs and prosciutto, made Asian by switching prosciutto up for lap cheong, balsamic vinegar for Chinese black sweet vinegar, and walnuts and pine nuts for deep fried chickpeas and furikake.  What I really appreciate is the team‚Äôs take on reframing the norms, of making swaps in ingredients so brilliant yet simple, that you cannot help but marvel at the harmony of the marriage between East and West.  If it wasn‚Äôt already clear from its branding as a restaurant and karaoke bar, Yum Sing prides itself on food as much as cocktails. This was keenly felt from our first hand experience, and reminded us that thoughtfully crafted dishes can be had anywhere‚Ä¶ as true foodies we should always keep an open mind.  Head to our Story Highlights on Instagram (IG handle: chufoodieadventures) if you want detailed descriptions of each dish.  üìçCBD, Melbourne üòã Will return üí∏ $$"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ2RMeHlBRRAB,Thank you Yum Sing House. Especially the lovely waitress who looked after us. I had a fantastic birthday. Dinner and karaoke were both awesome.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaDRfelZREAE,Great space for dinner with friends. We were a group of 9 so we had the feed me set menu.  It was a nice combination of seafood as our entrees and beef ribs with vegetables as our main. the portion size was generous.  Love the food and flavours! will definitely go again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNi1PenlBRRAB,"Friendly staff and nice atmosphere, came for dinner/karaoke. Only problem I had was searching for song titles on the karaoke machine at times. Had to search by artists initials instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNi1PMzFnRRAB,"Had the karaoke and dinner combo. The atmosphere inside was great. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. special shoutout to Nancy, Huy and Bae - they provided excellent service. The karaoke had lots of songs in different languages.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeXN5RHJnRRAB,Went here on a few different occasions but both occasions were birthdays and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. The food is also amazing. It‚Äôs hidden away however it‚Äôs one not to be missed. 10/10 would always recommend to my friends and family.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaktYR1V3EAE,"The flavours are well balanced and their variety of dishes is perfectly cohesive. The truffle siu mai, sichuan pork ears and salted duck egg choux dessert are the highlights with their weekday specials a real bargain! Perfect for our after work girls night catch up last night.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoak5qaEhBEAE,"Food was great, service was great, however they had limited amount of songs available in their system and the other apps like youtube and sound-cloud weren‚Äôt possible to use there due to some technical issues they had.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUpmajR3RRAB,Way to expensive for what u receive. Soup was horrible and way to spicey even though we got level 1 spice. Don‚Äôt recommend if u can‚Äôt handle spice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bUt2NVZBEAE,I paid $100 for food poisoning
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NE5UZ3pBRRAB,One of the best dinner in months. The seafood is fresh and high quality. Worth every dollars spent. Recommended
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NEpDYk5REAE,"Overall quite a bit more expensive than you would like to spend at a hotpot joint... It is not priced by your own portion choice and is rather packaged at set rates and sizes of sides ordered. This makes it far more expensive than normal. Overall good experience, would recommend going with groups of more than 2 however as most of the soup was wasted."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzZYdXh3RRAB,"The reviews have to be fake no way this place is rated 4.8 stars from 5k reviews. The price for the amount of food you get is insane. $165 for two people. The soup base cost $30 just so you could cook the food!! So essentially you gotta pay a $30 entry fee and pay for meat ontop of that. The complimentary self serve sauce bar is not complimentary!! They charged me at the end of service and there are no labels and no warnings it cost money. The soup was horrible, we got level 1 mild spice level out of 4 and it was like i was eating Molten magma. Other then the heat the soup had zero taste and my god was it oily infact thats all it was, Spicy oil. The meat quality was terrible and tasted like it had gone bad. We were waiting 30 min just to get our drinks. Dont let the presentation fool you which was actually amazing as you can see from peoples photos. The place looks great but everything else was terrible. Avoid at all costs."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLVoyVG1BRRAB,Over priced for cheap thin cut meat and watered down hot pot soup it was like more like hot water not hot pot highly suggest not to go to this place very over rated I think there ratings are all fake. Stay safe and stay away :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWN6aVBBEAE,"Good hot pot, just need some better english speaking staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb2EtWjJ3RRAB,"Firstly, the food/dish selection is minimal, more variety is definately needed.  Secondly payments for the soup base are done separately from the dishes. After spending over $100 on the dishes via their website. We walked out and got chased down for forgetting to pay for the soup base. Payments for soup base should also be done via the site.  For the price point all of my mates expected a better experience."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeC1fZnVBRRAB,Interesting cheese toastie! Loved their savoury sandwiches.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNEpPdmpnRRAB,"The touristy gimmick is worth it, once. When you order, the staff member pulls out a completely pre-made sandwich and heats it on a griddle. The face was even pre-stamped on.  The cheese tastes like rubber, but we did get that great 'pulling apart' photo. And then we threw most of the sandwich away. It wasn't worth eating."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZ1pMTWFnEAE,"Let's say it's probably 4 stars if you're an instagramer but for 13$, a toast with rainbow cheese is not enough; it barely tastes the garlic bread that comes with it (you can have strawberry flavor as well)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMnViN2lRRRAB,"Added some excitement into our day,  something new and fun and would recommend to other tourists and visitors to the cbd. It was a 1 man show and he was working hard and as fast as possible so there was a bit of a wait but we did expect it so weren't to concerned. He was great with my kids and told them the best way to open their rainbow toastie. It's a tiny store so no where really to sit after and eat but lots of places around you can find to sit. Over priced for a toastie but it's the fun that comes with it that makes it worth it.  They have other sandwiches and drinks too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNUxxcVZnEAE,I do think this food would be good but they sold out of everything they close at 4:00 and my family and I had to walk half an hour up hill to get to this place and we can‚Äôt come again until the next time go on holiday and we‚Äôve been waiting to try this for ages but we couldn‚Äôt fly because each time we got sick. So In conclusion the lady just probably couldn‚Äôt be bothered to make something close to closing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtam9IQWdRRRAB,"Not even open at the designated times on website, socials and ON THE DOOR. Too lazy to even respond to email and messenger inquiries to clarify opening times. No online posts to suggest that they're closed for a reason. My girlfriend and I were visiting for two nights and walked past numerous times to a locked door. Do you just open whenever the hell you feel like it? Another instagram fad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldm9yZElnEAE,The rainbow toastie is for Instagram. The loaded bread tasted much better.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cDdDSmZ3EAE,Not great value for chicken toastie
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MGV5RVdnEAE,"Amazing rainbow üåà toastiest, cheese taste like tasty cheese üßÄ ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c015a2ZBEAE,"Fun takeaway place for loaded sandwiches, we did not get the rainbow one but the garlic prawn and bacon ones, delicious. Night time lights up sign, great for photo"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeElLU1NREAE,Pretty disappointing to drive the kids into the city for a special treat to find out your not open During your opening hours!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPX0x1TmVnEAE,"We really enjoyed our yabby tail toastie. The brioche is so soft and buttery, the sauce complements the yabby tail. All up, it's a little expensive for the price, but it's still very tasty. Will be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX2RPLUN3EAE,The Toastie is much more chewie and naturally it's full of suger & cheese.  But the experience to visit this place is like no another. The opening of the Toastie and looking to the rainbow üåà colours is amazing. Loved this place.  They have few tea in their menu which is really delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb3FxQUpnEAE,"A total hidden gem! I took my partner here as a surprise for our mini-anniversary because he LOVES toasties. I expected it to be good from all I'd seen online, but this surpassed my expectations. Everything was delicious. I had the yabby toastie, which wasn't spicy, just had a lovely sharpness to it. The store itself is quaint and charming, hidden away in a small laneway off Little Lonsdale st. My only complaint is that we don't live close enough to order it through a delivery service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyblBDaUZ3EAE,"cool experience! but definitely a one off, fun photo moment. rainbow toastie looks cool but the cheese has a really weird flavour to it but anyways a fun experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycUt2OVZBEAE,"Toasties were the prettiest at Rainbow Toastie; 2 pieces of white bread and a thick, 6-color cheese sandwiched together. The cheese was more sweet than savoury, and overall it was sadly quite tasteless. Service was friendly and the toastie was very Instagram-worthy, however. :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd3NfaVRnEAE,Third visit there. Never disappoints
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtektXTktnEAE,Must visit destination in Melbourne City ü§†üëëüòç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX2JlaDl3RRAB,From Sydney to Melbourne for this magic toastie
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM2V1NS13RRAB,Tried the Yabby tail toast and Rainbow toast today. I have to say they didn't disappoint me regardless of the price. They also made sure that the drinks I ordered were leakproof so that I could take it home using my bike.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhcm9PRWZREAE,"The Sky Drink was absolutely delicious! Very sweet though so my throat felt a bit funny afterwards but definitely worth a try. The cheese toasties are cute and tasted pretty good...more of a try it once thing. Overall, very happy with the food, drink and service for my first time experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOXRDODhBRRAB,"This one is for the favourite grab and go style food in the CBD. @rainbowtoastie_melbourne is Korean style of grab-and-go toasties!  Their delicious show stopper Rainbow cheese toastie is a must-try,  slightly on the sweeter side but tastes bomb with garlic bread.  The other styles they offer is vastly different from other sandwiches I have tried around  with generous serving of toppings and signature sauce.  Much loved was their beef and egg toastie- found all the flavours nicely balanced, with the rich and creamy yolk going well with the crusty bread. The beef also comes with a decent amount of fats, giving it plenty of flavour alongside.  Do give this one a shot!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MVBxbDF3RRAB,Such a great experience. Great food and great staff.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSemNqWS13RRAB,Yucky
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamRtR293RRAB,Such a hidden gem in the city. The food was delicious and the staff were very helpful. We strongly recommend the fried chicken and the bingsu was SO good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmRIbDlRRRAB,"Very nice experience there, the chicken popcorn bento box was ideal for our pickie eater kid, it was kid friendly and the stuff was very nice when offering us a shaved ice cream which we had never tried before and is delicious ! We will definitely come back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMWRqeWNnEAE,The chicken popcorn is really good and so is the sweet potato fries
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGJHajhBRRAB,I‚Äôm always there for their budget-friendly milk tea via EatClub! Wish there could be more options! Cash and card accepted. No toilet on-site available to public. Easy navigation via public transport with just a short walk. Disability-friendly entrance.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXFIRmZREAE,"Daniyeru's Detailed Review:  Customer Service 3/5 *Standard, nothing good to say but nothing bad to say either.  Food 2/5 *Super cute for the Social Media posts, but you will soon know how bland and flavourless the Bing Su desert is. Go here for the photos, once, take photos. Eating it is optional.. Unless you like eating ice flavoured, shaved ice with colouring that looks cute.. * * *  Value 4.5/5 *If you get the couple/double set you get 2 toppings and 2 Bing su to choose from. Great value. But if you compare value versus food, it is not worth it. You wiuld rather spend money on something you can taste.  Atmosphere 5/5 *Really cute and well decked out. It is unfortunate the bing Su desert they heavily advertise is flavourless failure.. Please reform the menu and recipe and perhaps you'll have a winning combination.  Overall *I'd only recommend coming here if you really want to take some cute photos, otherwise come in negstive expectations so thst you won't be disappointed when you take the first bite.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ3RpOEJBEAE,Pretty tasty chicken and Bento boxes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZ05DelZ3EAE,Cozy space with cute cushions and even better chicken. The chicken was cooked to perfection! I also love the sweet potato fries!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdGY2cHlnRRAB,Order the plant-based meatball Bento Box. Very yum.  Try the monsterbing. Many flavours to choose from
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCZ2NQVzlBRRAB,Staff served me wasn't aware of Shopback Pay.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdXFEcGNnEAE,Love how crispy and tasty the chicken bento were.  You need to try their chicken wings too. Very nice place for Taiwanese street food.  You can even request for some chilli powder to add on for more kick !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbjZtUk5nEAE,"Really love it. Definitely should try out Orange Tea, the passion fruit flavour was dang fab!! Can't wait to come back ü§§ü§§ü§§"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM2JxTjBRRRAB,"Great crispy wings always pair with some beers, one of the  best in CBD !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOW96SzB3RRAB,"Ordered two lunches and one drink Bento side dishes are sour, drinks are wrong The clerk didn't even say an apology. A store with poor quality attitude"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN1pyVm5RRRAB,"Their meals are packed in takeaway boxes that are perfect for on the go meals or to be saved for later. The meals contains a box for rice and vegetables and another box is for the crispy meat. Everything is seasoned well and filling enough for one person. The food at Bento King is not something you can be easily sick of.  Their Orange Tea is so refreshing and is amazing for a hot, sunny day. Like their Bento King food, it is healthy and made fresh, you can the citrus in your drink which just adds to the flavour.  I think that having both a food and a drink place in one is really so convenient."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtb3J1TzZBRRAB,"I ordered popcorn chicken bento ($15.99), with chicken 'sauce' on rice. In addition to that I asked them to make it spicy, which didn't work out great. As for the food, I believe one of the employees accidentally served the dish in 2 boxes instead of one, and that's what I got served. I didn't mind it anyway. The rice was fine, while the veggies were steamed. That's it. 2 whole quail eggs with the rice were tasty. A bit more flavour would've worked wonders. As for the chicken, it was quite dry. The taste was okay, but don't expect too much. As for the spiciness that I mentioned in the beginning, just a pinch of chilli powder was sprinkled ü§¶üèªover the chicken pieces. A few pieces were a bit more chewy. Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for some quick Taiwanese food, this place is worth a visit, but keep your expectations to minimum."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtelByUVNBEAE,"Salted crispy chicken tastes good, but the hair is not good Found a hair"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdE9QajVnRRAB,"On the menu, the bento sets looked inviting and nicely presented. However, when we received the food we were majorly disappointed. There was random unidentified meat on the rice which was not advertised in the menu, and it overall was not a very tasty meal. Also, the veggies were simply defrosted Costco vegetables, not nice ones as shown on the menu. The worst part was the bad food poisoning the next day. Sadly, the whole day was spent on the toilet thanks to this food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcFlLWUxBEAE,I never received my order and the restaurant is refusing to refund. They claim that the driver didn‚Äôt pick up the order and they had no way of contacting the delivery person. So if you are ordering do not use Order Up unless you can pick it up yourself üôÑ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ3B2M2hnRRAB,delicious taiwanese bento
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGFhOEJBEAE,Very sugary lychee Yakult tea even with half sugar. Yakult was separated and drink had a lot of artificial flavouring. Brown sugar boba chewy and tastes the same as regular boba
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3RmQzhBRRAB,"I ordered the salted chicken bento plus tea 20.49 for takeaway but only received my bento :( Price is high for the portion. Bento comes with a large container of rice and shallow small container of chicken.  The bento came with two small quail eggs unlike traditional Taiwanese pop chicken bento meals where a whole marinated chicken egg is used.  For reference, Hot Star sells the same Taiwanese crumb chicken at $10 and the size is as big as a human face."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWNDRmd3RRAB,Fried food is better handled. The white rice is too wet. The amount of side dishes is less. Chicken cutlet rice is recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcVkzeXdRRRAB,"Delicious Taiwanese bento box, very authentic, the drinks are amazing, too!! The signature drink is passionfruit QQ jasmine tea, brings me back good old memories ü•§üçπ Definitely recommended!! The store even offer 10% discount for first respondersüôåüèª"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPczdmNnVBRRAB,no happy hour from 3-5:30
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4X0xEakt3EAE,"Food is great, staff are friendly. Yes it's a bit smokey but that's street bbq style for you. The only downside is how slow tables are being cleaned especially the ones at the back. A table in front of me was still with dirty dishes when I came in and it was still there when I left. I've been to this place twice and it was the same experience. It's not nice to be eating surrounded by dirty dishes nor is it a good look. Cleanliness should be a top priority for any restaurant not just food and service. This place has great potential just needs some tweaking. Otherwise food and service was great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNjRLb0hnEAE,"I was probably one of this business top supporters. Talk about pork skewers everytime and it wont be just 2 pcs. I would order 12 so i can take it home to bundoora. It was recommended by a friend and since then i cant stop eating them. I used to save the sauce and eat with with rice alone. Thats how good it was! So when they opened this restaurant, i was excited because finally they have a place. Super happy for them but it wasn‚Äôt how it used to be. Maybe because their OG Workers is not the one marinating the meat now or mixing the sauce. I noticed more new workers in the kitchen.  I went again yesterday and today, hoping they bring back their old mix. But i noticed Some days, the meat was tiny bit saltier or citrusy than other days. Although it was still good, but not as good.  About customer service, their waiters do not seem they enjoy their job. I brought my kids with me and they loved to interact with filipinos because everyone we met was nice but unfortunately not their staff. Ok maybe they had a bad day, so i went the next day but nothing changed. Maybe a ‚Äúenjoy your food‚Äù reply would be nice after my kids and i say thanks‚Ä¶ lol but no biggie. My non Filipino kids were trying to speak tagalog to the waiters, they didnt reply nor smiled with their eyes(since they wear facemask) after that interaction, kids never talked when they served. I can understand 1 day of bad service, but it happened every time i visit. Cashier was great tho, at least he and she looks happy to be working.  Overall, great place to eat, but dont go there expecting waiters to say anything after they serve your food. Other than that, love the food and the cashier staff, environment, smell. The best filipino restaurant in Melbourne."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdzR6OXBnRRAB,Nothing wrong with the food. Spaghetti was just like back in Phils. BBQ pork is OK. The only negative is the place fills up with smoke from the bbq and quite irritating on the eyes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNWZUYk5REAE,"the food is good, we will go back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSam9YNGZ3EAE,Pork longganisa was not properly cooked! Still frozen inside. Too oily even the fried rice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbXZTOHpRRRAB,Food was average. My dessert order was forgotten and I had to tell them that I still have an order to be served. Service was at par with other Asian restaurants and the restaurant was okay. Not going back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNHBPVmdRRRAB,"Great BBQ! But their pork bbq did not taste the same since they moved here from their little stall at food lane Melbourne Central. I wish they kept the recipe, or if they see this review, they will change it back. When they opened this restaurant, they increased their serving which is great compared to when they were in the food lane. I always asked for extra basting because their sauce was the best! I remember I would travel 40min to go to Food Lane Barkada.  Overall, I love this restaurant, but because they changed their recipe for pork BBQ, I don't often crave it anymore, unlike back in the food lane."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSekxmRHdBRRAB,"Amazing Filipino ""street food"" with reasonable prices. However, our dining experience could have been better if the place was well set up."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeEx5VkNREAE,Really cool place with the classic Filo sari sari stone at the entrance! My gf from Phils loved the food so it must be genuine and I thought it was great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzRtRkVREAE,Ohhh shhh!! It's the Spot. Pinoy streets in the city
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX3BPWmFREAE,This was my first time having a proper meat dish. I ordered Chicken Inasal and it tasted good. Will visit here again to try other dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScDV1SHpBRRAB,Felt very genuine to the Filipino culture street food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeDZHQUl3EAE,"Pretty good mostly bbq meat filo eatery, it has a casual cafeteria vibe and it would be perfect if it was served on the sands of Boracay lol I'm impartial to barbecue pork, i would have loved it to be a bit more saucy and serve banana ketchup also but otherwise hit the spot, my husband had the chicken and isaw, I would have liked to try the spaghetti but I don't think I would have finished it. The staff were friendly and helpful. Only suggestion would be if the surfaces were wiped down often as I found where I sat quite sticky and the bathroom could do with a clean."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMjhIYWFBEAE,Cosy little Filipino restaurant with super friendly staff and delicious food.  The menu isn't massive but I have always enjoyed what I've ordered here  I love whatever is in the glaze that's on the skewers and half the menu  And the cute little food stall out the front with all the Filipino snacks and cooking essentials that you can buy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzU3VU1REAE,"This was on my ""To Eat"" list and surpassed all expectations. The place is tucked away upstairs and  from the little laneway below, it would be easily missed. As we ascended, our nostrils were treated to the aroma of heavenly BBQ.  We started with Kwek Kwek, quail eggs covered in fried batter, offset with a sweet and sour sauce. We shared the BBQed combo meals Inasal (chicken Maryland) and Pork Belly. Both were juicy, tender, richly marinated and lip-licking good. We topped off the meal with an Ube Taro - a hot, purple yam Tofu and sago dessert, reminiscent of the Chinese Tau Fu Fah.  I think we were the only non-Filipino diners, so we knew the food here is authentic. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the visit. The atmosphere was super casual, almost like being transported to a part of Asia. It's definitely a great place to try out scrumptious Filipino BBQ and tell friends about."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSX1lYZFVREAE,Laaaami!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMFptcGhnRRAB,"Barkadahan offers a great selection of Filipino street food that's sure to satisfy anyone's craving for  Pinoy food. The dishes are well-prepared and bring back flavors from home. The overall experience was wonderful, and I highly recommend giving them a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMGVUOFR3EAE,"Super love this place!! Sure treat whenever you're craving that taste of home.  They have everything!!! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, meryenda, pasalubong!  Highly recommend isaw O and chicken inasal, my faves!! And always leave some room for tahooooooo  They also have a cute little sari-sari store for that nostalgic throwback where you can buy chips, snacks, candies and even shampoo na tingi!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbHYyODdRRRAB,"Delicious! I love the atmosphere and the entrance! Very nostalgic, and feels just like the Philippines!  Love the arrazcaldo too! The ube Taho was delicious! The beef pares and the garlic rice was flavourful and reminded me of my childhood  I want to try the spaghetti next time XD"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScXVENV9nRRAB,Loved‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. tiiiiiny bit salty‚Ä¶.. probably a me problem. Thanks‚ù§Ô∏è
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdFBub0x3EAE,"I like most of the dishes offered in the this restaurant. They are tasty and very affordable. The restaurant also has a big space that can accommodate quite a big group. For that level of price, i would consider that the restaurant is giving very good service. The only thing or reason why i didn‚Äôt rate it as 5 stars is because i am not very big fan of the dessert. I find it tasted a bit strange but probably that‚Äôs just not my taste, others might enjoy them. I would definitely recommend everyone to try their skewers. The restaurant also display a lot of stuff on the entrance that will bring back Asian childhood memories, very interesting decor!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHZqU0x3EAE,Picked up some sushi for a quick lunch post getting my nails done. It tasted fresh though I didn‚Äôt really appreciate the wasabi stuck to the lid as I am not a fan and there was a bit of contamination onto my salmon

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlamZueVdREAE,"The vegetarian box that i got was fantastic, and the portion size was just right for lunch. just a bit confused as to why it cost 8 cents more than marked."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld09EVjBnRRAB,I bought some crispy chicken rolls at this sushi sushi not once have I ever had pink chicken in a crispy chicken sushi roll and when i returned to explain how the chicken was pink and uncooked even tasted uncooked and had a rubbery texture they tried to tell me it was a pink sauce which was obviously not true as you could clearly see that it was pink chicken and raw I also knew it wasn‚Äôt pink sauce because you could see the traditional white sauce that‚Äôs in every crispy chicken roll. I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience and not even getting my money back will not be returning ever .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMDhfelFREAE,Very disappointing experience. Had to go back to the counter three times just to get enough soy source ü•∫ Made me feel like a criminal. ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtck5pWENnEAE,"I compared it with the salmon avocado roll of a Japanese restaurant in the same food court, but the salmon avocado roll of this sushi specialty restaurant was obviously small in size and the seaweed was hard, making it difficult to chew."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcUxEZGdRRRAB,"This is pertaining to my experience at the MC location.  Service was fast and efficient.  Sushi was average and the reason for the lower rating was because i think my premium bento wasnt fresh. I liked the variety in the box, with a good amount of salmon sashimi but this location made it a bit thinner than the others. Their roll was good, but I found my crab meat had an off taste to it. Otherwise everything was standard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MHF5MlFBEAE,"Costumer services  nice, and the sushi is so nice and fresh"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaWJTUG13RRAB,severly disappointed  i understand the economic crisis but is this ludicruous inflation necessary??? i am a loyal customer and imagine my shock when my fav roll went up 30 cents!!!  great sush though ngl it hits different
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa2VMQ0lnEAE,Very good service! Very yummy!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcWREUHlnRRAB,Great sushi from this place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaHMydFlBEAE,"Very skinny sushi rolls for the price and not much filling either. peking duck roll was very dry, salty and fatty. Wouldn‚Äôt go back here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpME9DeVRnEAE,"Quick convenient and great quality. Sushi Sushi is  perfect place to grab a well priced Japanese snack when you're shopping in Melbourne city. You can eat in or takeaway and although at times there are queues, you're typically served within a few minutes. Staff are always friendly and efficient. Food always perfect."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzN3Atazl3RRAB,"Bought salmon nigiri which was made with a thin piece of off cut salmon (practically just the skin, no pink flesh) and asked if it was possible to get a replacement with a proper piece of salmon. The lady was not impressed then proceeded to go to the kitchen and mock my complaint. Very poor quality nigiri and customer service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzODVQMnR3RRAB,It's Sushi say no more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzM3RmVU13EAE,"This is my favorite sushi joint, I love the various range of sushi that are available, especially the customized bento boxes as per your need. The sushi here are extremely well prepared and delicious in taste. Also if you visit this store during its closing hours, you will definitely get any bento box for 5 bucks only. Also the staff is really helpful and nice and the price of the sushi is very cheap and pocket friendly. This place is highly recommended to all sushi lovers in Melbourne."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0lhUG9RRRAB,This place is terrible. Very very average curry and overpriced. Definitely won‚Äôt be going back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGZtd2tRRRAB,"So many varieties of dishes. Both vegetarian and non vegetarian options available. Had a large Thali plate with chicken chill with gravy, beef vindaloo, and beef curry with yellow rice and it was pretty good but could have been better.  Service was okish and price for the food seems to bit overpriced for a food court.  Anyways, not bad for trying."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSa2EtQ2JnEAE,Worst Veg Samosa ever. Super oily. No taste at all . Felt sick after eating it. Couldn't even finish it.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeUxtaU9nEAE,Authentic taste of Indian spice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNTdINjNBRRAB,"Ate at this restaurant recently, ordered what I can only describe as bland sauce and questionable chicken. The chicken is served as cubes and when taken apart shows absolutely no resemblance to chicken. At first I thought I had ordered a vegan option, but upon asking I was assured it was chicken. Left a very odd taste after the one piece I did eat. Portion of rice is far greater than the actual ""curry"" you do get. Server lacked basic manners and was very abrupt in her order taking. Never again"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCOC1IRXdBRRAB,Used to be good to eat here now very expensive and the food is always stale with no good flavour or texture 2/10
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCczdDVllREAE,I ordered the chicken tikka masala and dhal makhni and this was probably one of the worst meals I've ever had. The blandness and lack of flavor was appalling for such an expensive meal. Very poor representation of indian food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbExHZ01REAE,"I bought a dhal and butter chicken, with naan and rice. The chicken was bland and tasteless, the butter chicken sauce was nice but it did infuse with the sauce. The dhal was bland. I did not eat it and sadly threw it in the bin. Very disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdzhiTVlnEAE,Over priced and average curry. Large container and can of coke over $23.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtemF5YjBnRRAB,Loved it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNnVYc0FnEAE,First time I was here at little India I ordered chicken biryani but it was not so good rice were not mixed well and the chicken was half cooked not served well.. Really annoyed meüòèüòè ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcXVtdGtRRRAB,"Surprisingly good food! It tasted authentic to me. We got the chicken tikka and paneer masala with saffron rice, it was all really good and tasted fresh!  One of the chefs came to top up the tikka whilst we were ordering, so it‚Äôs definitely all freshly made throughout the day. The price is pretty decent too, so it‚Äôs definitely worth trying if you like Indian food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSc3BPSGVBEAE,"Chucked entire onion in it üòÇ maybe should chop up and spread out? some dish is not bad, quite unique actually, price is 33% more expensive, but understandable as it‚Äôs in a prime location. Could make use of more variety of food, didn‚Äôt have any choice other than chicken and beef. ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScmIzM2tBRRAB,Service is terribly slow and food is horribly bad. Waited long for my food. ordered mee goreng and made nasi goreng for me and insisted that it was mee goreng. Come on. would never ever spend my money here again. not worth it at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbGRXUWN3EAE,Looks nice with a lot of options of food. Had mix of sweet and sour chicken and honey chicken with egg fried rice and wasn‚Äôt too bad but could have been better.  Service was okish and price for that serving is overpriced for a food court.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNFltVXpnRRAB,The worst thing ever
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLUxEV0d3EAE,"The Sweet and Sour Chicken and Szechuan Chicken, both with rice ($12 in total) wasn't that good. I only bought them because it was night and they were giving out the food at lowered prices. Even then, the taste wasn't that great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodC1YRFRnEAE,I like the char keow Teow there.. a bit oily but tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNmRtMVd3EAE,Will not recommend this to anyone. not worth it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoX3FXWHFRRRAB,Food taste is bad and price is high compared with the amount of food. I couldn‚Äôt complete my dish. Very bad experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbjRfNGRREAE,If I could give a 0 stars I would! We ordered honey chicken and they put gravel in our bowl! Felt like we were eating tar off the road it was so hard. The service was really rude and they were inappropriate to my partner. Absolute disgrace
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMDhQbkRnEAE,"The worst honey chicken and fried rice I've ever had! The chicken was overcooked, dried out, hard and very chewy. The rice tasted smokey. My husband had pork and reported similar. Terribly expensive too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeXJTVFBnEAE,"Pitiful serving size, insanely overpriced, mediocre quality. Do not eat here, you will be disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQta1pPWkd3EAE,Delicious food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNjZLVkpREAE,If I could? I would have given 0 STARS. The food is really bad (not fresh at all) plus they don't treat their staff fairly (payment and working rights conditions) so I will never support a business where they treat their staff in such a way.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbVB5cG9RRRAB,Honey chicken so old and dry the plastic forks they give you won‚Äôt even pierce it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNTVlNlRREAE,Terrible service. The lady never smiles and didn‚Äôt even say thank you after giving back my change. Will never come back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcGJ6YmxRRRAB,Today for lunch I ordered a small rice and beef in black bean. The meat was like leather and before I finished eating the rice I was vomiting. I will never eat there again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aHViQm1BRRAB,We ordered the ‚Äúspecial offer ‚Äú where we get rice/noodles with 2 dishes which was for $15. We asked her to serve the fresh honey chicken which was just sitting there in front of us but she started serving the crumbs of the previous batch of honey chicken and said it‚Äôs the same (even though it was clearly NOT) and the portion was so little. Most of what she served us wasn‚Äôt even chicken it was just fried flour. Get your food from somewhere else. Not worth the money!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGFPVVhnEAE,"It was the most terrible experience, service and food I have ever had in Melbourne.  The food were cold and the price was over priced even compared to properly dine in restaurants. I spent $32 for a cold premade food which I could get a better meal from other shops where they cook by order.  I will never come back and would not recommend anyone to come and try food from here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMk82dkJBEAE,Chicken rice is garbage
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcTd5SGRBEAE,This restaurant has the audacity to charge almost 15 dollars with such pathetic portion. Not to mention the food they served is COLD. Avoid this restaurant at all cost!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMXVDZDF3RRAB,Rude staff and below average asian food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbHUzeEVBEAE,"Quite busy, but it is the Melbourne Central food court. Prices are high for the serving sizes. Standard chinese takeaway food that is enjoyable. Nothing more than a 4 star"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeTV5RjBRRRAB,"below average asian food. noodles had an unpleasant texture, broccoli had clumps of these weird jelly like globs on it that looked like vaginal discharge, extremely offputting. wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybGRHV3BRRRAB,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews, the serving size is very small and not at all what you would expect. Food quality was average."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybE5XeG5nRRAB,"I come to little asia to get fried rice and honey chicken every collingwood v richmond match when i am in the city, amazing food and 10/10 quality"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeUlmTkRREAE,The food salty and the price not worth for the small amount mealsüòîüòîüòî ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ1BXMGVREAE,"Not bad for decent Chinese, the selection they have is fairly basic but good enough if you want decent asian takeout, you can get specials during closing times."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzl1Uk9nEAE,"Excellent experience, great food and amazing service. Strongly recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTVfd2VnEAE,I ate with a friend and both of us enjoy everything and service was excellent
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOTZfLTNBRRAB,Crazy üòú good burger real enjoyed
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaDdXN3pRRRAB,"Good quality as it is fresh  but no good quantity , ordered chicken salad with rice and corn. I just found tiny stripes of chicken and one spoon rice,  had to go for another lunch. Will never come back. When you pay 16 dollar you shouldn‚Äôt be still hungry. Increase the portion and rase the price we are more than happy to pay more and get full."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWRRWRAB,Came today and had one of the best chili burgers in a decade ho go go Oporto
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdnFpeG9BRRAB,"Friendly staff, good food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaFBfZ0tBEAE,I went to Oporto Melbourne Central and even though they were so busy the food came out quickly and the food were delicious and the staff were excellent.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk95MlpREAE,"Oporto melb central is hands down my favourite Oporto!  The customer service ‚Ä¶. The OWNERS are incredible and really love what they do - so clear.  The food is always exceptional, my family love coming here once a week. If we could come more often we totally would!  Crave Oporto nearly every day - thanks for being so great guys, super hard to come across stores, employees and owners like you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk16TGpnRRAB,"Amazing customer service, short waiting times for my chicken and chippies. Delicious food, as always a returning customer! LOVE OPORTO"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUtqaUF3EAE,"""I stopped by Oporto at Melbourne Central and was blown away by the quality of their food. The burger was deliciously juicy and flavorful, with fresh toppings and a perfectly cooked patty. The chips were crispy, golden, and incredibly addictive. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant was welcoming and clean. I couldn't have asked for a better fast food experience. If you're in the area, I highly recommend giving Oporto a try - you won't be disappointed! Five stars. All around"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaUlpOE93EAE,"""I recently had the opportunity to try the burger and chips at Oporto in Melbourne Central and I was very impressed. The burger was cooked to perfection, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The chips were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. The food was of excellent quality and the service was friendly and fast. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Oporto and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for delicious fast food in the area. Peter"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNE5xdnRBRRAB,I came here with a friend and asked for extra sauce the staff did not charge me which was such a pleasure given the fact that everyone charges. The bun was a bit soft but still the burger was the best in a long time üëç ‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEtycVJBEAE,"Wow wow wow had a Bondi meal and it was amazing,the best in a long time ,Staff were extremely helpful, good work everyone"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb00tS29BRRAB,Horrible service was the first one to order and it took literally half an hour to get a chicken burger and fries. I walk up to the desk and they had practically put my order away and forgotten about it. As I got irritated but kept my cool I see them laughing from a far after their mistake.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMC0zQ1VBEAE,my favuorite oporto always so quick and fresh! yumm
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM3AtTVBnEAE,"I tried the quarter chicken mild chilli and chips with garlic dipping sauce. Very nice serving size of chicken, and crispy chips. Good value as opposed to other Chicken franchises I've experienced in th C.B.D."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDRfWVFnEAE,I prefer this over Nando's. Had the half chicken with maize as the side dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMnN2TnJ3RRAB,"I ordered the Bondi Burger, and ended up with Food Poisoning. Not a clean space at all.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNzVTQjJ3RRAB,"first time trying oporto grabbed some regular chips and the chicken rappa. chips had a nice subtle seasoning to them nothing extreme, they were pleasant but not amazing. wrap was alright too, fresh and juicy but also a bit bland, could have been a bit tastier although to be fair i just got mayo in it because im picky with sauce. overall most likely wouldn‚Äôt go again but food is good value for money however was just average to me personally"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbGRlWnZ3RRAB,Delicious ü§§‚Ä¶ good customer service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeUtyX01BEAE,"I really miss operto, used to have it weekly when studying in melbourne. Oporto please open up in Muscat, Oman. I am willing to take a loan to open one up."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCajdDcmF3EAE,I‚Äôve become a regular since moving to Melbourne. The staff here are always friendly and the food tasty& fresh. My go to is the double bondi burger or the half chicken box meal
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdzdQa29RRRAB,"Never sharted so hard holy f  I ate the oprego burger and almost exploded. Chips aight, that fresh DC never disappoints‚Ä¶. Churros aight Guzman has better tbh. My arteries are clogged and my insulin is non responsive at this point. I‚Äôm seing sounds and hearing colours. My stummy hurt too‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtX3BHM2lnRRAB,"Service is good maybe the food could be a bit more due to the amount of money we pay to eat here, but for the most of it the customer service is good and the food is great."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtblpPZ2d3RRAB,"The older women who runs this store is mental. The way I‚Äôve continually heard her treat her staff when just walking through the food court isn‚Äôt good enough, let alone when I was waiting for my food and she was discussing medical problems of one of her employees in front of another staff member and the public waiting for their food. The meals are always good but she is not."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbk5qZDZnRRAB,Best food here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd0tQa0NREAE,Bondi Burger with pineapple was great. Thank you to the lovely girl (lady) ( might be the owner) who was a treat to deal with. She reminds me of my dear sister who was a wonderful soul.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUpxc3FnRRAB,Maybe they want customers get infected. ü§Æ ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmYtcm5BRRAB,I LOVE IT
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoLTV5VEh3EAE,service was absolutely horrible and it was just so bad all together
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM1l6M0t3EAE,i was served a finger.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX0k2Ny1RRRAB,I visited KFC Werribee on watt on street today at 4.35 pm .store was empty there was 5 staff and a manager and the store was disgusting. It was dirty and filth . The bins were overflowing. No one wearing gloves when preparing food . I asked to speak to the manager and the cashier at the counter names Helen rolled her eyes  when I said it‚Äôs a food practice and hygiene is so important. How can a manager let her place of responsibility be like this . It‚Äôs disrespectful and wrong . Never again am I gna visit this store again . Disappointed..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoZ0xEbHVRRRAB,"One of the smallest KFCs, but service is pretty fast even during lunch time"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaC1fRU1nEAE,Fast efficient service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCck1PZV9RRRAB,Your average kfc fast service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCLUppLWxRRRAB,First time i got charged double price my bad I didn't check because it new menu spicy chicken one and the second time I ordered 3 wicked wings extra but they didn't put in the box since I ordered Zinger box ! So bad !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaDZmVWpBRRAB,Finger licking good!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbGNERWxBRRAB,Good but not great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLWFpVEFnEAE,"By golly it was busy today. The service was as normal, bit of a wait due to being busy. All of Melbourne central was. This is understandable in my eyes. The food was not at all good. Super greasy, chips looked as though they had been shown the fryer. Soft no crunch, almost like soggy chip's. I asked for extra salt on them (heath wise I don't recommend) and it less than normal. Nuggets were also a let down, the crumb had came off. Soft aswell. Drink was excellent, as no cooking or preparation was needed.  I feel as though staff were making food to have available but not to a standard that was acceptable. Might of been an off day.  That's how my experience was. Hope everyone eles enjoy theirs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCN0tpczl3RRAB,My chicken was too greasey and made me burp up a loogey which i promply spat into the deepfryer to be served up as a popcorn chicken
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtODUtUEJ3EAE,"They gave me a wonderful meal, they didn't have kiosks there though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNDhHX2VBEAE,Probably the worst kfc I‚Äôve gone so far. Oil was old and my fries were old. Took some time to make my food too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX2VqUWV3EAE,highlight of of the cbd
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNGY2WGdnRRAB,fat
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldHZidmFREAE,Kentucky Fried Chicke
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMzlXY3NRRRAB,Seems you can't go wrong with kfc in Melbourne
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcTVMTldREAE,Clean and tidy area within the food court Friendly staff Not overly busy at 1pm but service of food was a little slow DEFINITELY worth waiting for fresh hot chips and fresh hot chicken
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHIzWC1BRRAB,Ordered chips and gravy. When they called my order ready for collection the told me they‚Äôd run out of gravy and asked if it would be ok if they swapped it for a potato and gravy. I said no sorry and they made such an ordeal I just said it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll take it in the end. Don‚Äôt fulfill the order with no product available if it‚Äôs such a hassle to refund! People taking orders are always so grumpy too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX01MSXd3RRAB,very bad service and always stockout. you have to wait about 30mins to pick ur order
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MUwzN01BEAE,The food is ok. This is not the first times!! One of the stuff member very terrible service. She spoke rude to me every time I bought the food there. And i ordered food number 23 but I got number 25. And she didn't even apologize to me and didn't say anything. But another stuff member apologized instead. You should consider why you hire people like this!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaVpIYXlnRRAB,Flavourless food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbklPanJRRRAB,The gyoza is undercooked.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeXFLcTZBRRAB,Order take away over phone and they said they never received the order.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN3NhdHNRRRAB,Very good food but a bit slow service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNnFITlhnEAE,"I came here for lunch and grabbed a sushi and sashimi lunch pack. Several hours later I experienced some stomach cramps and bad diarrhoea. Other than a black coffee that was the only thing I had consumed up to that point that day, so I think it was the sushi. The sushi itself was ok, but for $18 I probably will avoid this place in the future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM0txbTRRRRAB,Worst ramen and fried rice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNkttWjV3RRAB,The worst Katsu Curry Don I have ever tasted!  Will never come back for this meal again....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtczRPVzhnRRAB,Best place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMteW9Qb0V3EAE,"Was average food, could‚Äôve been better, was a decent price but the food was hot and the other half was stone cold."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtOElqNkl3EAE,Was more Chinese than Japanese FYI  Big portion sizes and pretty ok for value but just felt a bit ‚Äòdirty‚Äô and oily and like someone just threw everything into a box which I guess they did.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtZ0lMM1hREAE,Excellent
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMjVtT0ZnEAE,"Was served rotten vegetables. Tasted pretty bad, no seasoning either. I had already travelled too far to get a refund sadly. On top of that it was $13.50 for a little container of just old veggies and tofu. Very regretful purchase."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc09QM1VREAE,"Amazing is great! However, they were closed when the hours listed in Google state that they are open. Was looking forward to a Father's Day banquet but sadly, that didn't happen.  If the hours are incorrect, they should be updated ASAP"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M3IyYk5nEAE,No tempura. Gyoza not fresh. Watery Sapporo ramen
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjl6RDJ3RRAB,"It was nice but i got food poisoning from them and I hadn‚Äôt had much all day either! I was starving but after i ate an ume bento, i felt sick! I‚Äôm not coming back either!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb2FpODRnRRAB,"I usually get the yakisoba here and recently it hasn‚Äôt been as good as it was a couple of years ago. The cabbage to noodles ratio is uneven. It‚Äôs too salty, and the cabbage tastes oily. The prices of the drinks are also way too high.  The service here is pretty decent though. Pretty fast."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyenVuTXNBRRAB,Very bad sushi
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOTgzVHFRRRAB,"One of the worst food I‚Äôve ever had, just had noodles from here and got all my health imbalanced day after that! Wouldn‚Äôt recommend at all"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaVl5eDF3RRAB,The food was not greasy and okay!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcV9pb0dREAE,Love this Japanese foodcourt Obento. Their food was delicious and well presented.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZzl5MGZREAE,"teriyaki chicken was tender, but the sauce could use some salt - paying $5.40 for a 390ml Coca-Cola made me question my sanity üëçüèª ‚Ä¶"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOW8yMEJ3EAE,"That girl serving on March 23 at 3.45 pm is an illegal worker underpaid for her work, as a result, the customer service demonstrated was so disrespectful by yelling at customers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbmF2ZnNnRRAB,"Decent place for mall quality sushi, not great but it was passable for lunch. They have a lot of different cooked meals you can pick from that are well priced as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dUxEanRBRRAB,Ignorant and unprofessional staffs. Charge the wrong amount for my order. Forgot some items in the product. Highly unsatisfactory.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOE1xUzJnRRAB,"üëçüèªüòç  Delicious food at the LG of Melbourne Central station! A good variety of items to choose from.  üçúü•ô  For lunch I had their Poached Chicken Pho bowl ($13.90) and Veg Spring Rolls with Pepsi Max ($6). The pho was sinply excellent. The rice noodles were short and perfect. As for the soup, it was chock full of flavours with tender meat and pickled onions elevating the entire experience.  The spring rolls looked gorgeous, were crisp and tasty. Those went quite well with the drink!  üíØüòã  A must visit place for pho lovers!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHNEX2ZnEAE,"The staffs are so nice. She recommended me with her fav rolls in the store. Yummy rolls! I got the beef, duck, pork and shrimp ones. I like the pork and shrimp roll with Hoishin sauce."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMU9DWTdnRRAB,"The shop is located super conveniently in front of Melbourne Central train station so it‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre looking for food on the go.  The BBQ Chicken roll is made with tender and flavorful chicken, fresh herbs, and a sweet barbecue sauce, while the low carb barramundi roll is made with succulent barramundi fish wrapped in rice paper with fresh greens and a zesty dressing (no rice vermicelli inside though because it‚Äôs low card).  The rolls are generously stuffed and packed, ensuring that you get a satisfying and filling meal.  In terms of service, Roll'd Melbourne Central is known for its efficient staff who are always happy to help you with any questions or concerns. The place is usually quite busy, so it's a good idea to be prepared for a bit of a wait during peak hours.  Overall, Roll'd Melbourne Central is a great place to grab a quick and delicious Vietnamese meal. If you're in the area and looking for a tasty and healthy lunch or dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMllYM1dREAE,DO NOT order here if you're for work lunch. It takes far too long. Even heavily discounted it's not worth it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOVlhbFZREAE,Found the soup to be very saltyüßÇ the temperature could be hotter too. To heat up the rest of the ingredients that are cooled by the aircon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGZDblhnEAE,I preferred the roast pork belly noodle salad. The roast pork belly was very deep fried and dried. It's horrable compare to other Roll'd. Won't come back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNzYtOVVREAE,"$9.5 for this ‚Ä¶ why did I even bother, how sad"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxLXAzV0ZREAE,Worst place ever for delivery. They cancelled the order after wating for an hour. They just closed the restaurant and left.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxbUtHSVdBEAE,"Rice paper roll was nice but expensive, price wasn't displayed which is against the law"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdGFibU5nEAE,"Roll'd sells Vietnamese signature dishes including Ph·ªü, spring roll, rice paper roll, bun,...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbGU3Y0xREAE,Woman who I can only assume to be the owner was making transphobic remarks to her colleagues and then threatened that I would not be allowed to take my pick-up order which I already paid for.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN2NpbmVBEAE,"Very Great Customer service with smile, they are happy to customise your meal according to dietary.  My go to meal is Banh Mi(Viet Sub) and low carb Rice paper rolls..  Nice n healthy food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpX04ySHpBRRAB,"Rolld is delicious and reliable, if a little on the pricier side. The staff at this location are always friendly. The pho broth isn't as good as you will find in a pho restaurant but the rice paper rolls and banh mi are always good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRLWQtRUd3EAE,"I recently visited the Melbourne Central Lion pub, and unfortunately, my experience was not great. While the location is convenient and the atmosphere is pleasant, there were a few issues that left me feeling disappointed.  Firstly, the prices at this pub are just too high. I understand that it's located in a prime spot, but the cost of drinks and food is simply not worth it. It's disappointing to feel like you're being ripped off every time you order a drink, and unfortunately, that's how I felt at the Melbourne Central Lion.  Additionally, even when the pub was relatively empty, the service was slow. It took ages for me to get a drink, which was frustrating and made me feel like my patronage wasn't valued. When you're paying premium prices for your beverages, you expect to receive efficient and attentive service, but unfortunately, that was not the case.  Overall, while the Melbourne Central Lion pub has a nice atmosphere and convenient location, the high prices and slow service leave much to be desired. I would only recommend this place if you're willing to overlook these issues and prioritize atmosphere over cost and efficiency."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OE5DQWlnRRAB,Food was hot
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSejVydlB3EAE,"Owner (DJ) requested my exit after I requested a song not on his playlist.   Shame. Called him out on it and was dissmissave.  ""Live"" band also on a click track which is a shame because they were quite good for 40yo.  Owner is trying to prove himself.   Look forward to the reply.  Cheers,"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSelp6S2xRRRAB,"Music was way too loud, and we couldn't hear each other. Drinks were expensive and mediocre at best. Toilets and floors were covered in vomit. Wouldn't recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWFhZDRBRRAB,"Nachos grande was not grande, $22 for a very small serving of nachos, the ""chilli"" beef had no chilli in it, the queso cheese was bland and overall a disappointing starter -  The lions parma was not as disappointing in comparison but easily the worst pub parma I've ever had. The atmosphere here is beautiful and the place is decked out with gorgeous vintage furniture, pool tables, a cosy corner and incredible bars. Fantastic place for a drink but save your money and skip the meal. Wait staff seemed nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOXFlOFd3EAE,Staff were very accommodating and happy to switch channels on tv to game requested. Good deals on drinks.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNW9qNC1BRRAB,"My mate ordered two parmas, one for myself and one for him. After waiting a long time only one parma came. When we asked about why the two parmas didn‚Äôt come together, they came back to us and said that we had only ‚Äòordered one‚Äô despite explicitly stating two to the guy at the bar who placed our order. Service needs to be improved!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScHFfdHZBRRAB,Good Atmosphere. Beer was cold and staff friendly
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSOHNMeG5RRRAB,Food was OK!!! Toilets need a good clean
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb3ZqR3pnRRAB,Fantastic place for weekday lunch. Great staff superb food. Will be back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbUl2U2NBEAE,Went here last Saturday (15/4) for the first time. All the bartenders who served me were polite and cool. Ordered nachos at around 4pm for table 31. It would have been nice if the waitress didn't intentionally slam down a knife and fork in front of me just because I politely asked for a set so I could also eat with my partner.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNEsyUWVnEAE,"Price is enough, i like the chicken bbq pizza it was superb and chicken fried wings, cleanliness is jz enough, the toilet is not that clean üò¨,overall it was ok ‚Ä¶"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzZTRW13RRAB,Our local
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2NQS3RnRRAB,Side salad comes with no dressing. Tacos are hard but flat (crack when folded). Barramundi excellent. Beer is beer
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2ZiNnNBRRAB,Nice food friendly atmosphere
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSLVlIWS1BRRAB,Mum went mad for the spicy nachos! So delicious
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScHJ6Wk5BEAE,"Tall white man as a bartender says he has worked there for 15 years completely racist. Told me to throw the lemon garnish in the rubbish bin when the facility does not have any provided R/bins for customers to dispose such things. Later on i ordered a french martini and recorded the process the female waitress was like did you ask for my permission i was like i have nothing to do with you i just wanted to see how it was made and keep it for personal reference. She told me to delete the video on spot, it was so embarrassing. Later the tall cxxt walks in and i told him you guys are RACISTS. HE TOOK MY DRINK AND TOLD ME TO LEAVE. PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS VENUE IF YOU'RE BROWN.  PEACE. ‚úåÔ∏è One star is alot they deserve no stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEtlYm5RRRAB,So many store's its hard to visit all of them.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScExtXzBnRRAB,"Lovely look and vibe, with a fine selection of beers and a good Guinness. Ultimately, though, the food is severely overpriced and rather disappointing. Ordered the steak sandwich - it was about 30% smaller than I'd like, was close to well done and was extremely tough. Not likely to return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMExMdVFnEAE,Good pub food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN19qWElREAE,I like the spot but 1 beer just cost me 16.38. This will be the last time I come here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MlA3ZGJBEAE,Just superb food and service but there is a warning. You'll need 15 mins to read the menu it's so extensive! Fabulous choices and stunning food and presentation
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdDg2cDBnRRAB,Really amazing food and service in a great location. Favourite was the lobster ramen. Would definitely recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScG9IUWJnEAE,"Terrible food I have ever had, grilled scallops not even hot as you said the scallops was grilled, stir-fried pork belly was too cold but why you served on sizzling plate with out hot at all, onion served with pork belly was cold too and uncooked, seem like you just put into the plate that not hot at all"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzdmS2h3RRAB,Gyoza Gyoza In Melbourne Central  üëáToday I got üëá  ‚Ä¢ Hokkaido Scampi & Scallop Lobster Soup Ramen üçú ‚Ä¢ Sapporo Half Lobster Soup Ramen üçú ‚Ä¢ Edamame ‚Ä¢ Orange Juice ü•§  So yummmmmm ü§©ü§©  #japanesefood  #food #melbourne

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN3JtZF9RRRAB,"Amazing food, Best lobster I have tasted The pork gyoza was delicious Will definitely be coming here again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCaUs2Zk9REAE,"Second time being here and the food is good as always. Went with a friend and we had two types of gyoza and the okonomiyaki. Never had okonomiyaki so was great to try. Good prices, excellent service. We recommend the pork and garlic gyoza!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcDc3SDlBRRAB,"Finally got a chance to come back to this place again after three years of covid, still very good service and really tasty food. So satisfied! üëçüèªüòä"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcDU2TWZ3EAE,Great spicy Ramen. The soup is very delicious. And the grill scallop with miso sauce is my favorite. Friendly staff and great service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNkpPVEVnEAE,"Lovely place to have a meal on a Friday night! Had the lobster ramen, grilled oysters, scampi and abalone. Dishes were well presented and generousüòã"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNzVYejBBRRAB,Very tasty gyoza but a little pricey
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtaXZIS0F3EAE,Very friendly staff and a good place for ramen and gyoza. I picked the pork gyoza.  My friends had the lobster ramen.  I ordered a small side bowl of udon which was done well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOTY2RFV3EAE,Very nice lobster noodles
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleXFEXzZnRRAB,"Wonderful place for dinner. Groovy music, excellent service, delicious food. Everything is fresh and good quality. No pressure to order alcohol or to leave quickly, even on a busy Friday night. I'll be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaEtTN093EAE,Good tasty
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMlpXRlF3EAE,"Service, food and timing were all fantastic. 100% would recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbWMyekxREAE,Friendly staff and wonderful food but it was not the easiest to find in the corner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWRTeXhRRRAB,This is one of the best gyoza I have ever had. The cheese okonomiyaki was so good my date nearly cried 10/10
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNGVQdlRBEAE,Lobster Ramenüëç ‚Ä¶
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnAtQzFnRRAB,"Great service, delicious food and intimate vibe."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnRLaDJnRRAB,the food was really nice and so was the service :D
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnZ6Q2dnRRAB,Yum
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnZ5ZzFBRRAB,good food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbHEyOGlBRRAB,"Unlike the normal pork soup base, the lobster soup just amazing! Will come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXZxbEhREAE,I had the deluxe sapporo lobster tail soup ramen and salmon tartare. The salmon came with the lotus chip. It was amazing. The egg in the ramen is perfect. The soup is rich and creamy. They both tasted nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ3Y2QVB3EAE,Asahi on tap. Good service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzVuTGdRRRAB,gogo
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzdtUVh3EAE,gooooodÔºÅ
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4ektheTRnRRAB,"Tuscan pasta - veg was undercooked and hard, it was tasteless as a whole, it looked like there were herbs but you sure couldn't taste a thing. Wasn't even asked if I wanted dressing, I had to go back up and ask. Won't bother next time, $10 for flavourless poorly cooked food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURScV9YUEVnEAE,Customer service is horrible. Worth it going elsewhere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSamFYOC1RRRAB,Variety of fresh salads. Ask them to go light on the dressing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaWQ3MEVnEAE,"At 12pm I Ordered Chicken & Avocado salad. The young man kept filling with only greens and hardly any Chicken and Avocado. I had to ask twice ‚ÄòCan I pls have more Chicken & Avocado??‚Äô And each time he kept putting more greens, his excuse was ‚Äòthey won‚Äôt be enough for other ppl‚Äô Really?? I wasn‚Äôt asking for EXTRAS! IF I WANTED GREENS I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT A BAG OF GREENS FROM COLES FOR $5. I visit this place regularly and have introduced my work colleagues too. Sometimes it‚Äôs just too hard‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt be returning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNk5uZm9nRRAB,"Friendly staff and good coffee, too many healthy choices"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScTh2VjlnRRAB,The girl short hair make coffee is not friendly and very slow - peoples hurry up to get coffee and go to work - but she just slowly make coffee and joke - laugh with other staff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeDVmTW9nRRAB,"I liked the choice of salad they offer. I had a Medium sized salad which gets me 3 combinations of salads. I took falafel, roasted veggies, and buffalo chicken. I enjoyed the meal. Will visit again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURock0zS2VnEAE,"It taste really good and only cost 10 dollars for a meal, their Lime Mayo is the best dressing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoME5DYU1nEAE,would i go here again no never ! not worth paying $10 for this tinsy bitsy bowl of salad. i ordered the cripsy chicken salad. thats the name on the tag. But i got a pasta salad with few chicken pieces in my bowl. when i asked why there is more pasta and only few chicken pieces she said thats how it is. and i asked her to add more chicken she said pay $4 more. Please have a look at the portion size and be the judge. NOT WORTH $10 FOR a REALLY DECEIVING SALAD!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM2NHYV9RRRAB,So overpriced and rude service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM3VxUGFREAE,Service slow in rush morning. also service girl ignore the queue and picked customers for training their staff. bad experience if ib rush.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeGJQUVlnEAE,I visit this place mostly when I am in the office.. as they give a good mix and a variety of healthy options to choose from.. but considering the price they should increase the amount of meat/chicken in the servings.. as its not cheap‚Ä¶
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcVpiQ0NnEAE,"The lower ground soul origin: food was good as always. Sadly The service was lacking. I put it down to the lady having a bad day, but she was rude and almost rolling her eyes at me. Might need a refresher in customer service (I've worked in customer service many years and I'd definitely retrain my staff if they treated customers like this)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNFpUX2d3RRAB,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I was served by the sweetest girl today (I think she is South Asian maybe?? She has a brown complexion), she made an excellent coffee and was sweet enough to compliment my hair after I had just gotten off a bad day at work, really needed that!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMXV1WWx3RRAB,Don't serve food before 7am.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejZmR19BRRAB,Coffee was terrible.  Extremely weak.  They might as well have just served warm milk.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1by1PNllREAE,"Really lovely staff members, but dear Soul Origin, if you‚Äôre going to charge $5.70 for a regular coffee with a milk alternative, please make sure that your baristas are adequately qualified because for that price I‚Äôm expecting one of the best coffees I‚Äôll ever have. Nearly $6 for a disgusting coffee that I had to bin after two sips is ridiculous. I‚Äôve had lovely coffee from Soul Origin before but it‚Äôs definitely a hit and miss and definitely not worth the risk for that steep price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbFBqUXl3RRAB,Not bad area for food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX1pmYkVnEAE,"Arrived at 8:30am on Sunday, both Google AND your own website says open at 8am. The store is not open. Update/correct your opening hours! I understand Google isn't always correct but your own website should be."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyME5pTk53EAE,Ice latte always is my favorite to make my day But today my ice latte with ice and ice melted water from the fridge So today my latte wasn‚Äôt good Hope next time I can get it better again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNWFyOElREAE,I order chicken and avocado salad take away and they gave me the beef one which was hidden inside  told them that I don‚Äôt eat beef even though It has never happen before but this time it was worst have to throw everything
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdVlhX2JREAE,Thanks for the surprise discount in the food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbVBlN2NREAE,Their paninis SLAP and are great value for the cost. Staff are friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHODZ1WjdnRRAB,I have had a much different experience compared to Soul Origin in Maribyrnong. Service was ok but toppings were very limited on my pasta. I feel like I got mostly pasta with a significantly small amount of crumbed chicken & avocado. I'll probably still eat here again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNGJQTGRBEAE,"This place is great.  I went for the first time last year at the DFO branch. A solid place, but I don‚Äôt think much of it. Later that week, my school brought us to Melbourne central to have lunch. I couldn‚Äôt find many familiar places in the area, so I just decided to go to Mad Mex. My friend was hesitant to try it, although he took a shot. I ordered the Tacos with Guacamole, and he ordered the nachos. We were absolutely stunned. The guac and salsa might be some of the best I‚Äôve personally had, and I‚Äôve had tacos in California!  We‚Äôve made it a monthly visit, and are going in a few days. Genuinely might be the reason I like Mexican food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGJ6WVh3EAE,"The staff seemed nice and friendly but when I went to buy a large burrito bowl they skimped out on all the ingredients essentially giving me the serving size of a small giving me only one scoop of rice before trying to give me a second but deciding it‚Äôs too hard and putting it back, and when it came to the salad and cheese they gave me a pinch of everything while the burrito before me got a mountain of cheese. Highly saddened by this experience when normally it is one of the better ones."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoM1pMQmpnRRAB,"Stopped here for a burrito while in the area. I thought it was quite good for Mexican food outside Mexico/California. I would have liked the salsa to be a bit spicier, but I don't think thats what the locals prefer. If your traveling to Melbourne from California this shop will remind you of food from home. I thought value was quite good considering how much food you got. Thanks!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdzZ5RnlRRRAB,"Food was great, customer service was great also. The employees are always friendly. Sometimes it's a little bit hard to hear them if it's loud in the food court though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCd0pfbWhRRRAB,It's a mad Mex what more could you ask for basic westernized Mexican fast food .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbV9LNDJRRRAB,Exorbitant prices for cheap slop padded with rice. Very poor value for money. Avoid
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCM2U3dEVBEAE,"Used to love their food, but one day I Find a fly in the picture, I told the waitress, she looks like‚Äù dont bother ‚Äúit was gross."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCZ0ktaW5BRRAB,"Very nice and extra generous , food is delicious and the delivered food didn‚Äôt lack the quantity or quality. Thank you !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOWI3X21nRRAB,Excellent food and service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdDZHTEdBEAE,Food was amazing and the price was pretty resonable. Staff were nice too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdHFEWFh3EAE,Delicious burrito.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldDViUEd3EAE,So very disappointed in the food we had ordered from this place. We ordered the grande melt and cheese quesadillas and our quesadillas had zero cheese inside. We paid for extra cheese which was an additional $2 and there was minimal cheese in the grande melt. The food was not well put together and carelessly thrown together. Very disappointing when you‚Äôre spending nearly $50 on food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZzZMSm13RRAB,"I went to mad Mexican yesterday and I was APPALLED by the price. I ordered 3 tacos which should've cost $13, but I soon realised when I got my ""meal"" that I was charged 40 NOT 14! I am furious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbExhMDhBRRAB,Nice Mexican choice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlenVySkJREAE,Typical fast food. My veg quesadilla was fine but my husbands burrito was soggy as they scoop the bran with the liquid.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eGFqSE5REAE,"Food was delicious, the man who served me went above and beyond to help me with me order and brought a great friendly vibe to the store would give 6 stars if I could"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnZHNVBnEAE,"Friendly staff, lovely ambience. I like Mexican food alot. The music around made me to feel I am in Mexico. I wanted to visit this place again and again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a3RmXzVBRRAB,Very yummy food! The people were very friendly and helpful! For sure I will be back eating more Mexican food! Highly recommend!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a3RlcUVnEAE,"Delicious!! Super tasty, Huge serves, Extremely satisfying And Really friendly staff. Yummm 5 Stars!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGVDZWFnEAE,I asked regular size of naked burrito and Indian guy keep say no rice no rice !!we do not have a rice ! And there is rice i can see He tried to sell something that had no rice only vegetables and sauces So I asked the cashier for rice and got it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cHA3OVB3EAE,Fast and tasty lunch! They have a plant-based mince now! So im in love with them again.
