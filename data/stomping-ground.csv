0,This brewery has indoor and outdoor seating with a standing area and is complete with a small tree house for the young ones. In general the foods are pretty good  but nothing indifferent from your typical pub/bar food. Service felt nonchalant but still very helpful and accommodating. Great for mini gatherings or parties.Food - 6Service - 8Vibe - 7Price - $$
1,"After so many visits, this is consistently a great spot for enjoying craft beers and hanging out in groups big or small. You can even arrange a tour of the microbrewery to get behind the scenes, which is fascinating.There's a decent range of food choices that cater for the herbivores and carnivores alike. The dishes are always very edible but for me, lack the distinctive flavours I look for. On this visit my Chicken Maryland was quite bland and dry but the salad was sweet and punchy.The huge converted warehouse has indoor and outdoor seating and a super casual feel to just chill. Staff are friendly most of the time. For those who enjoy specialty beers, Stomping Ground is definitely worth checking out."
2,"Always a great place to grab a beer after work on a Friday. Drop past tonight for a quick beer and chat. Attentive and friendly staff.  Was promptly able to get a table,  but worth booking to ensure you get a table. Had the beef ragout pizza. Which was excellent on the thin crust.  Also had the $1.50 fresh oysters.  Just good atmosphere and vibe there. Good selection of beers as well."
3,"What a great vibe! This brewery is one of the most kid friendly places I‚Äôve been too. It is a big place but I‚Äôd recommend booking in advance over the weekend as it gets quite busy. They have great sharing plates, beers on tap, and a selection of drinks to take home if you fancy.Did I mention they also have a playground!?"
4,"This is a Melbourne establishment and staff here are the best (Mish and many others served us at the counter and I don't know how they stay so chilled. I can see an excellent working culture here). One of us Spilled some beer and one of the guys serving spotted that in a matter of seconds ( and they are already crazy busy) and made a joke about him spilling at the interview and even mentioned that they are hiring. The beers, pizzas, croquet, calamari and everything we had was unique and tasty. It is a very vegetarian friendly menu too! Thank you guys, I am tempted to apply for a job but will come back for some beer and burger very soon ;)"
5,"Cannot say enough good things about this place. The beer is fantastic (the ""hop"" section of the menu is of course my favorite), great atmosphere, friendly staff, and as a plus you get a nice view of the factory. Another thing I appreciate is that they actually know how to pour a glass of beer - with a proper collar. This is my favourite brewpub in Melbourne so far. If you don't know what to order, the staff picks are always a good choice."
6,"It‚Äôs no secret that stomping ground has insane beers. My first visit here was unreal, I couldn‚Äôt recommend the chips and/or pretzels enough.Unfortunately I visited a few days later with a few friends to grab a meal‚Ä¶ a big mistake.The BBQ Rump lacked flavour and was very dry and Nduja pizza was also soggy and cold by the time it arrived.Again, I ordinarily love this place but would recommend that if you visit you stay away from these two dishes.**edit in response to Stomping Ground‚Äôs comments**Hi SG, thank you for your reply. I originally added the reference to the wait time because the pizza arrived soggy and cold. I can completely appreciate that you/many others are struggling to find staff - as such I have removed my comment regarding the wait time as I don‚Äôt want it to be further misconstrued. See you soon SG."
7,"Great place to grab some beers and food at a place slightly nicer and more interesting than a normal pub.Food was fairly priced, and ultra delicious (especially the burger) and the selection of beers is wide with an option for everyone (including the non beer lovers I was with)Sadly only in Melbourne for a visit, so can't come more often!"
8,"Fantastic tour about the history of stomping grounds and an in-depth look into the process of making, packaging and storing beer.The tour guide (I think his name may have been Nick?) was incredible with amazing energy.Would highly recommend to anyone interested in learning about the brewing process of beer.The photo attached is the tasting beers you get included in the tour."
9,"We had our annual Christmas party at stomping ground and it was fantastic! The food was plentiful and delicious and the service was amazing! In a post Covid world you can be guaranteed that the team at stomping ground put in every effort to make you feel welcome and enjoy your stay! I would not hesitate in encouraging anyone to drop in and enjoy the atmosphere, the food and the friendly service! Thank you especially to Matt who went above and beyond with his customer service! Merry Christmas to the entire team and thank you for making our gathering memorable!"
10,Highly recommended. Great food great brew produced locally. What a wonderful iconic place this Brewery and Restaurant really is in the heart of Collingwood! Food was amazing for our Christmas lunch (thanks Chef & Kitchen for whipping up the delicious food:) ) The place has a great vibe and overall ambiance of the venue is fantastic! Thanks again and looking forward to coming back again.
11,New favourite watering hole üôåüèæ huge space & great decor with sunlight that streams into the space.Edit: Came back for dinner last night and they did not disappoint. Everything was spot on and their service was great - even let you bring your dog inside üëåüèæ
12,The venue is large with plenty of seating yet it does get packed easily so don't be surprised if you have to queue. It's great cause its dog friendly. Plenty of beer to choose from. There's plenty of pizzas and other standard pub menus. I found the food to be average though and a bit over priced. I'd still recommend the place as the atmosphere is great here.
13,"I come here from time to time with work colleagues due to its proximity from our office. I always enjoy the general atmosphere and the beer selection is good and I always enjoy sampling something new. However, where we are always left disappointed is with the food quality. We eat every time and have tried a variety of menu options. The quality of the meat used for steaks seems low, hamburgers are dry and over-cooked, pizzas are lacking in flavour and don‚Äôt seem to be made with any degree of expertise in what ingredients go well together. The bowl of chips and the slab of garlic bread are probably the only things on the menu that you could trust in my experience. If this part of the business could be improved, you‚Äôd have a great venue on your hands."
14,"My boyfriend and I went this afternoon and they told us to wait for a table by the pizza section. We ordered a beer and waited 20mins to be served. In the mean time they sat a family and a straight couple before us. All of them were walk ins and didn‚Äôt have a booking. We ordered some oysters and paid for them and suddenly got told by one of the the host boys that oysters had been sold out and they would refund us. After a couple of minutes we saw oysters going out to tables seated after us. They clearly didn‚Äôt want us in their venue! What a shame! 2023 crew, you can be better than that!"
15,"'Classic for a reason'! I'm there all the time! So many things I like about the place. Let's try to list a few!The space itself is beautiful, and it's big, so you can go in confident you will have a place to sit. And then you can try different parts - the open area at the back in the summer, or the middle part with nice fans, or the little side bar area at the front.The beer is great, and changes regularly - so there's always a little moment of 'oooo, what can I try this time'. And then the food is really good. So - if you've never been, try it. If you've been, don't be shy to return!"
16,This place had a great buzz feel. Well decked out. Nice selection of Beers. Good assortment of food menu items. Reasonably priced and easy to get to from the CBD.Friendly staff and I look forward to next visit.
17,"Stomping ground is as perfect a brew pub as one can get. We've been there a few times now and the whole experience has been great.I won't comment on the entire selection of beer but every one of their sours is excellent especially for the summer. Sitting in their 'garden' space with a pint is extra relaxing. All the food that we've tried so far has also been great, it's easy pub fare and the thin crust sopressa pizza (pictured) was a perfect accompaniment to the beer. You can't go wrong with the bowl of chips either, lightly seasoned and crisp - they are all designed to go well with the beer.All in all they're regularly going to get my dollars and it will be money well spent!"
18,"My husband and I cycled to SGB without a booking because we were just planning to have a beer. We are visiting for 2 months and have struggled to find food that we like and is not too fancy or meat-driven.  I loved the vegetarian options. My quinoa salad had feta, two kinds of beans, maybe some edamame, seeds. ... anyway, loads of good stuff.  I also got the summer veg, which had squash (sorry, I‚Äôm American and may use the wrong name but the yellow things!) and pine nuts.  My husband, true to form, got a margarita pizza.  The sauce and crust were on point.  He‚Äôs from NJ so he‚Äôs qualified to be a pizza critic."
19,"Great food, great beer, great service.Special thanks to the Scottish Sam who recommended the wine based sour. I am a known hater of sours and its the first one I liked! His beer knowledge was brilliant and he was great to chat with."
20,"Industrial but warm and relaxed atmosphere, ideal for families with kids. In Melbourne is very hard to find a quality restaurant with indoor playground and they have it. Big tick for that. Also kids menu has very healthy options, they have a veggies plate which is fantastic, very hard to find in regular pubs. Another big tick! Food was delicious, the burger it's so good. We also got some calamari, chorizo and pizza. All the flavours were spot on. Beers are good, and not only their taste but the variety its so wide, all the spectrum of beers for almost every taste. Dessert quite yum as well. Staff friendly... well bar staff a bit serious, but outside the bar everyone is customer focused. It will become a place that we'll visit more often. Well done!"
21,"Cool venue. The place has a good vibe. The food was good on my first visit and the service was efficient.When I visited for a second time, I didn't like my food. I ordered a garlic and cheese pizza. It was extremely oily and bordered on inedible. I wish I had ordered the burger I ordered on my first visit as that was really good. I also noticed another table who had left behind most of the same pizza.I still liked the other dishes and the drink selection is good so my rating remains."
22,"How can you not love this place? It‚Äôs spacious, has amazing music, amazing selection of beers, a cool display of the brewery, multiple types of seating including high stools and long wooden tables. It‚Äôs the perfect place to go to with a large group of friends to kick it back and catch up. We ordered the SPA, the 6 beer flight and pumpkin pizza. The only thing we‚Äôd say is that pizza was just okay and felt like it was missing something overall but we can‚Äôt wait to be back again for all the fun and drinks"
23,"Ordered two mains and an entree. First main came out within 15 minutes. After waiting 20 minutes for the entree and second main, I asked one of the servers where the remainder of my order was. She was dismissive and said it will come when it's ready. Entree and second main then arrived 10 minutes later. First main was cold by this point, but I couldn't be bothered informing a server, as a fresh meal would have taken forever to come out, and at this point in the night I just wanted out of the venue."
24,"A half filled beer glass with a full day of banter is what I offerüòâ.When it is 40+ degrees outside and it is end of the month, year and decade.Well you should make a wise choice, go to one place in Melbourne which will offer you wide range of Craft Beer. With their own brewed beer stomping ground ,i would say tops my list of breweries to visit in Melbourne.It is not just a good beer place but is one with good vibes, good music and great staff.Coming back soon to visit this Summer üòú."
25,"Great space, super friendly servers, dog-friendly (they even brought a bowl of water for our dogs without asking), and there are lots of beers on tap. But, personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the beers. They're all fine, but they were all a touch watery and a bunch of them tasted similar to each other so it didn't feel like it had as much variety as it first seems."
26,"It‚Äôs my favourite brewery in all victoria, the atmosphere, the place, the beers, everything is great, so I like going there with friends to enjoy a meal and nice beer, plenty of options. Given the government restrictions the food menu is not too diverse right now, but that‚Äôs totally understandable, same with the beers, really glad in general to be able to hang out at this place again, and looking forward to coming back soon."
27,"The place was packed with young families and couples when we arrived at 1pm on a Sunday. The waiting staff advised me that the food will take at least 45 minutes for my order of  Anchovy pizza and BBQ octopus salad. As this is a brewery, we ordered two pots of the in-house brew while sitting at the pizza bar patiently waiting for our food and people watching. The salad arrived first whilst it was well seasoned and dressed, the octopus were cut into small pieces and tasted like marinated rather than BBQd. Nevertheless overall it was delicious. Then came the pizza, after the first bite I knew it was something special. It has just the right saltiness and flavour combinations plus the thin woodfired crust.... my partner and I agreed to come back again and try another pizza before declaring this as the best pizza bar in Melbourne üòÄ"
28,"Had a brewery tour here that was great - staff were very friendly and answered any and all questions we had, plus gave us a taste of a beer that hasn't yet been released to the public. We then got a tasting paddle with a wide variety of delicious and creative craft beers.I then had lunch, and everything was cooked to perfection. I had a tandoori eggplant which was full of flavour and a fish dish that was not quite as flavoursome but still very nice, with salads on the side.All of the staff at the brewery were very kind and welcoming and seemed like they loved working there."
29,"Great vibes, ranging from chill, upbeat family friendly to Friday night loud, party beats. The eclectic jungle of plants, warm lights, visible steel beer tanks & vintage fittings create a unique and comfortable atmosphere.Awesome range of drinks. Good servings & delicious seasonal menu. I always leave feeling satisfied. I can‚Äôt believe how well they do the humble roasted veggies & garlic bread.Staff are super helpful, not overly friendly, never in your face & do a great job despite always being understaffed.Stomping ground always hits the spot - give it a shot, you won‚Äôt regret it."
30,"Recommended.The vegetable life in abundance in this place, I loved the decoration and the atmosphere.Of course, I drank the pale ale and also tried the black beer.We had the Sausage pizza was very delicious.We had a good time in this place with friends and family, we would come back again."
31,"Great place to entertain large parties, kids and even pets. They make amazing drinks in house and the sour beers were to my delight. The menu is pretty basic but up to the quality Melbourne standard. Last week an error took place on a busy Saturday and the lovely manager and staff rectified it and made me one happy camper. Much love to the team!"
32,Really amazing palce for big groups snd families.Open and lots of room fof kids to run around in plus nice little play area in the corner.Food was amazing and service was top. Cant wait to visit again.
33,"Extremely busy on a Friday night especially so close to Christmas NY period. Still love the energy and the place is incredibly inviting, lively and vibrant. Would love to revisit when it is much quieter and the roof is opened.The food platters we had as part of group Xmas booking were generally quite nice. The sesame battered finger eggplants seems to be lacking the basic seasoning, but remain cripsy outside and soft on the inside. Love their beef sliders, margarrita pizzas and that oh so fluffy pita bread!"
34,"For a drinking hole, this is a pretty decent spot. Loved the beer selection, my favourites were the ""hook turn hoppy pils"" and the ""one-eyed IPA"". The food menu had a good selection too, I ordered the ""double burger"" for $18, with fries for an extra $4. For the price, the food wasn't a great experience. They were a bit tight on the chips, tight on the bacon and my burger came out almost raw. The waiter communication was a bit poor but about 15-20 minutes later, they did replace the burger, and in fairness, they were a bit more generous with the chips. Overall, great on the beer, pricey on the food, but excellent space. I can't give halves but this is a 3.5/5"
35,Absolutely loved our dinner here. Such a cozy vibe with delicious eats. Be sure to try the pizza!Taste: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è/5Value for money: üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞/5Customer service: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è/5Atmosphere: üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç/5Will visit again: ‚úÖ
36,"Beautifull PlaceThis place give you a warm feeling.The staff are very friendly, all smkle and all are helpfull.This place is also good for nighttime with a group of friendsenjoy your stay hereFood goodNeed more advertisment as you not see easily the placeAll plate look yummy"
37,"Delicious food and beer. We shared a few of the starters and it was all great, tasty and fresh. You can build your own tasting paddles and the notes are great for helping you decide. The only downside is that they put all the beers in the test and then don't tell you which is which. We worked it out but would be great to just have this noted down like other places on a sheet or back or a coaster."
38,An awesome venue with excellent beer but sadly the staff let this place down. It's advertised that all bar staff are cicerones as if that's a good thing. Essentially it just means everyone behind the bar are moody and snobbish. I'd rather be served by staff who are less knowledgeable and friendly. Will still come back but the actual transaction of buying beer here is sadly not a great experience.
39,"PERFECT day out! Had a small celebration there and had the most perfect time. Service was impeccable from start to finish. Food came out quick, and as a bonus, the quality was awesome! Venue was amazing with a little playground. Fun for the whole family! Great value for such a great experience. Note: Parking is a nightmare, but that's just Collingwood. So plan carefully. Otherwise, it's bookmarked for next group gathering!"
40,"Had lunch here today, interesting setup, had the beef brisket which was delicious the glaze was spicy , the kaiserflesch and cabbage side lacked volume and flavours. I did note that sides are limited with a meal, you really need to add sides from the menu to pad out the meal.But I would happily go again now I know my way around."
41,"Not only does stomping ground have amazing beers they also have amazingly friendly staff too.A mate and I did the brewery tour today and would recommend it for everyone. Our host was Nick, who not just knew all the aspects of the brewery setup but was also worked in the brewery most of time. He had excellent knowledge and told us awesome anecdotes that really personalised the tour.We had a great time and the tour was one of the best brewery tours I've ever had. Great work all round!"
42,"We celebrated my son‚Äôs 5th birthday party here yesterday and everyone had a great time. We live close by and come here regularly because of the play area. Parents can enjoy a cold tap beer and a tasty bite (food is always consistent and delicious -> the pizza is üëåüèª and there is a decent variety of great vegetarian dishes), while the little ones run around in the cubby house."
43,"Bit disappointed by the Oktoberfest party. It was advertised on the Facebook event as a ""ticketed event only"" and ""DJs providing the party tunes from 7pm"" but you didn't need a ticket to get in, and there weren't any party tunes or vibe at 7pm. Your staff cleaned up everything by around 6.30pm for a 40th birthday party function and it felt like you didn't want the Oktoberfest crowd here any more, so most people left.It's annoying because we planned that as our evening plans, and we then had to find something else to do. On top of that, we could have just come without a ticket and paid for what we wanted separately. It's especially frustrating as there were other Oktoberfest events on, and we chose to come here instead."
44,"I made a booking for dinner but also had ordered a product from the shop sepparately and the person answering my emails made sure everything was ready to pick up when I went there and answered all my questions very quickly. I appreciate that level of customer service care!The pizzas are great! We had the mushroom and cauliflower and the nduja ones and were very delicious.Great ambience, cozy and beautiful place.Hopefully when shortage of staff is not a thing in Melbourne in the near future the scanning codes for orders will disappear and the nice staff that cleared our table and brought our dishes will also take orders!Last, but not least: amaaazing beers!"
45,"I recently hosted my 30th birthday with 80 people on the deck at Stomping Ground and could not recommend it anymore! The canape style food was outstanding, the drinks were 10/10 (as usual), and everyone was so easy to deal with. I'd particularly like to thank Tana, the function manager, for all her help organising the event. If you are looking for a venue to host an event of this size, look no futher!"
46,"The three stars is for the sake of good times I have had in Stomping Ground before. This is a beautiful venue. I used to love an evening or afternoon here during the weekend to relax, enjoy great beer and meet up with friends, so much so as I booked to have my birthday at Stomping ground. Sadly it was a mistake.It was very busy and unfortunately under staffed. The app could not take the orders and kept crashing. Waiting time to order at the bar, and then to receive the order was very long. I appreciate the challenges with staffing that the hospitality industry is facing, but surely you can take booking to the extent you can manage with number of staff available. Anyhow, waiting time was the least of the problems.The most disappointing was the cake service. I asked for the cake and candles to be brought to table, and confirmed additional fee for kitchen to cut and serve the cake for our guests after. This was discussed at the time of reservation, and then again with floor manager and other staff when we were there. We ended up having the cake brought to us sliced and the candle on one of the slices and unlit. They could not lit the candle for us, reason: no matches available. We had to get a lighter from our car, and couldn‚Äôt take any proper photos as the cake was cut already.On top, staff retuned me to our table to get my mask before accepting to engage with me twice while others were just walking around with no mask on.All in all it was a disastrous birthday and a shame given the amount of money we spent. I do not recommend this place for events and I seriously hope for actions to be taken to properly manage the place, and it‚Äôs vital assets such as online order apps. And perhaps, put some thought into handling bookings made for birthdays or occasions as such. It is important to realise that you play a vital role in the make or break of the day."
47,"The amazing Tana and team provided the most caring, passionate, and professional experience we could have imagined when trying to organise a last minute cocktail event for a 60th birthday. So much detail and attention were put into the event that everything went perfectly, and I honestly could not recommend Stomping Ground any more highly! The food and the incredible beers were the highlight of everyone‚Äôs night and the legend Gaby went above and beyond to ensure the birthday boy had what he described as the best night of his life. 10/10 thanks everyone!"
48,"Always great to visit the Stomping Ground! The food is great and the staff are always very friendly and helpful. This beautiful venue is always 'adapting' to the weather - to have the roof open or heating. There is a great kids play section. Bathrooms are clean and pleasant.I wish they had a couple more ciders - but there are plenty drinks to enjoy.Great experience during these covid times with the staff, booking and the ordering at the table. Head's up, the team dont stagger mains and starters for example. So you need to stagger your ordering.The pizzas look simple, but good. Burgers are great!The starters are great as well - Pork Terrine & Croquettes are delicious.Watermelon smash is light and fruity. Willy Smiths Cider is always a winner."
49,"Awesome beer hall with a great selection of drinks. I booked for 12 then emailed 5 days out to increase the booking number, no response so had to call and confirm they could accommodate the change which they agreed to. Got an email back 2 days after the booking saying they hoped it worked out and I was able to accommodate everybody so not sure where the communication channels go, obviously not coherent. Food was delicious, service fast and a family (and dog) friendly atmosphere during the afternoon."
50,"We held a 60th birthday party for 60 people in the Boiler Room, a fully private area at one end of the venue.  Everyone commented what a great venue it was, with an indoor and outdoor area with a slide-able roof, how attentive and helpful the staff were and how good the food was (we had the 8 piece canap√© menu).  We played our own music playlist over the sound system which worked very well.We had a fantastic night and would highly recommend the venue and the staff who were all fantastic."
51,"I had my wedding reception here and booked out the private deck for around 50 people on a Saturday and it was amazing! The booking staff were incredibly friendly, organised and accommodating to all my requests, which made for an incredibly stress-free process. Their communications throughout the lead up to the event was quick and there were no issues with anything I'd asked for. The staff on the evening took care of everything in the background and made sure the evening ran smoothly, and everyone was incredibly friendly. All of my guests loved the food, drinks, service and the casual atmosphere, which is exactly what we wanted. I would definitely book here again for an event."
52,"We hosted our staff party at Stomping Ground. And what a venue?!It has an awesome airy feel throughout with so much greenery.Our canapes package was very good value for money & so delicious. The beers were always going to be great and the service was very professional & helpful. The feedback from our staff has been very positive. ""Best staff party in years!"""
53,"Driest burger I have ever eaten. Also not tasty.Beverage service here is great. Beers and whisky good.Food service bad.If you can bring the food, why can't you clear the plates inside 45mins of finishing?"
54,"Had dinner here tonight.  What a great job Stomping Ground does to ensure a Covid safe dining experience - absolutely considerate and professional.  Beers were great as was the food.  Had been avoiding large venues like this but will be back to this one as they are doing a great job with their Covid safety practices.The pepperoni and anchovy pizzas - both outstanding, as were the hot chips.  Thanks for a good night out."
55,"Absolutely excellent selection of beers and good food in a really pleasant space. Unlike a lot of breweries, stomping ground doesn‚Äôt just do the trendy IPAs and sours, but tries to cover all styles of beer from the old and new world, which is a breath of fresh air, as for me the hoppy stuff can get really boring. A brewery for true beer lovers, with excellent food to boot, the Bavarian should take a cue from these guys‚Äô pretzels. Will come back every time I‚Äôm in Melbourne."
56,I like this venue and of course the beer. I usually consume your products at the bottle shop or if I go to another venue must likely I‚Äôll end up having stomping ground. But I went a two weeks ago with my partner and we have some IPA and the beer was very flat it didn‚Äôt taste like crispy yummy IPA it was more like a  flat lager.We address this to the bar tender which had a terrible attitude by saying that‚Äôs how it is‚Ä¶ that he doesn‚Äôt taste anything different. ( we thought either he would change our beers or offer us another option/ similar I mean just give us a nice service) but no.It was disappointed  because we love your beers and by going to the brewery it self and have a flat beer and a rude attitude from your staff members just give us a very bad experience.
57,"You let me I on my bucks. I know I had probably had more drinks than you would normally allow . I understand d I had a few but you were able to see tvv mg at I actually wansnt too far gone. TVs k you for being a part of a supportive culture that allows people to celebrate without being denied/punished. Happy saturdays if a a returning customer, buck"
58,"What a great venue!The building is beautifully designed, with great detailing.However, the experience is let down by several factors:1) lack of bar staff- there were hundreds of people here this afternoon... And only three bar staff.. people were getting frustrated.2) inconsistent quality of food. Some of the pizzas were lovely...others served cold with half cooked ingredients. Chips/fries good, fried kipferler potatoes with cheese, under cooked and cold.In a venue that is above average prices(read expensive)  no matter how busy, one expects better service... especially when the staff are generally so rude.Can do better.. but because it's busy and they are making loads of money... they don't care."
59,"We went to the stomping  ground this afternoon for drinks after work . On arrival I asked if there were any restrictions on where we could sit of a time limit, I was told by the bar staff we could sit anywhere once it did not have a reserved sign . We found a table which has no reservation and ordered our food and drinks . You ordered from the table which was great and the food was nice . We were enjoying our drinks and our evening out when we were approached by a member of staff snd told we needed to leave in 15 minutes. I explained we had been told we could sit at any table and was told there were no restrictions. He went on to say when we had arrived they had not been fully booked but since then they had booked our table. I find this so rude and dismissive of our business and our group . Basically we were being dismissed because they had a better offer . I understand venues are all trying to make money but this in my opinion was rude , dismissive and terrible customer service. If this is how they treat their customers it‚Äôs very poor .The most disappointing thing is we were having a great time and would have stay and spent lots more money.It‚Äôs amazing how one person can change your whole opinion on a place and leave a very bitter taste in your mouth"
60,"Love this place. Great, but unusual beer, lovely food, nice ambience. Mr Yum, the ordering system hiding behind the QRCode was rubbish! It said do I want to create a tab. Yes, of course, I'll pay at the end of the meal. No brainer. Except it deducted the money straight away and we hadn't got the funds in that account, so it refused to use my card anymore and the bank blocked it. Rubbish!! üòÑ Not Stomping Ground's fault. Pay a visit if you haven't already."
61,We had two babies in high chairs and were seated at the only table with direct sunlight at 12pm. It seemed like a huge inconvenience when we asked to move to any other table that was still empty. Other tables didn‚Äôt have bookings until 12:30pm. Food was average and to use liven you have to go to the front and again seem like a huge inconvenience. 15% surcharge on Easter Saturday seemed a bit strange given that it isn‚Äôt a public holiday.
62,"Awesome venue - during the day it‚Äôs got a really nice modern/industrial vibe; while during night its a much more pub feeling.Staff are friendly.They have a very good selection of beers and other drinks available - though sadly only two ciders, usually.Food is really good. Slightly on the pricey side. The pizzas are good, and the rump burger is delicious, with a cream cheese and chives  sauce. Its a very good size, yet comparatively light and doesn‚Äôt leave you with and overly full tummy.Chips are delicious too."
63,"Order everything from your table. Pizza steak, lamb, burgers and much more. Service is quick.Lots of in house drinks to experience: lots of in-house beers to gin.Rustic decor and ambience.A good experience get down and try."
64,"Beer is excellent. Vibe was perfect, on a Tuesday night. Food is very very good. Service is perfect. Ordering app works well.Highly recommend."
65,"I recently had some drinks for my 30th birthday at Stomping Ground and was reminded just how great a venue it is. Friendly and helpful staff, great atmosphere and most importantly, really good beer.A couple of things to note:1) I booked well in advance for a Saturday afternoon and was very glad that I did, as it was absolutely packed. If you are going to have a decent sized group, it makes sense to book well in advance.2) The only slight negative from the venue (and it is very minor) was that I was contacted the day before to confirm my booking and I mentioned that people would be coming in and out over the time of the booking. However, by about 3.30pm, there was a line for the door. Would have been nice if staff had asked if I wanted to put my name on the door just so that some of my friends could have gotten in a lot easier.Overall, a great experience - we'll definitely be back!"
66,"We have had a party for our staff recently. The venue staff were very attentive and friendly, the food was very tasty, especially eggplant chips and salmon rillette . The venue its self is combination of industrial, edgy feeling with lots of plants to soften the look. One small comment on the noise level, mainly due to the number of patrons. Otherwise worthwhile to visit."
67,"We had a very enjoyable time at Stomping Ground recently for our work Xmas party. Great food and drinks. There was a little mess up with our online food order, but they fixed the problem immediately, and gave us complimentary starters and put $100 on our bar tab, which was more than they had to and very much appreciated. Will definitely recommend this place and we will be going back again. Thanks!"
68,"We had our engagement party here over the weekend. We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly. Our guests loved the feeling in the venue, as well as the food, which barely lasted 30 seconds when placed on the table. Really lovely venue, would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a relaxed vibe for their next occasion."
69,Food is fine if not overpriced for what you get. $50 for two mixed drinks disguised as ‚Äòcocktail jugs‚Äô-Staff childish and entitled. ARENT UP ON CURRENT COVID LAW so generally are just sucks about irrelevant things.Save your money to spend elsewhere.
70,"Had a Sunday birthday booking for a larger group which was an easy process to follow.Overall the food and beer were good, but the stand out was the friendly and helpful staff who made every interaction a positive one.Whilst it was quite busy and wait times suffered due to this, we came away with every intention of visiting again!"
71,"I chose to hold my 40th birthday at Stomping Ground Brewery and was so thrilled with the venue (booked out the private deck area), the food (so much choice and so delicious), the drinks (great choice of beer and wine), and all the staff on the day (so helpful and lovely).I would highly recommend this venue for your party/celebration. Rachael was fantastic to work with in the lead up to the party, communication was great, and she helped guide me through the preparations to make the day go perfectly.There were so many compliments from my guests about the space, food and drinks. Thanks again Stomping Ground!"
72,"One bad egg spoils the dozen. We had our end of year break up here with a group of about 25 people, food and drink we're excellent value for $45 per head. The shift manager and bar staff were super friendly however one waiter assigned to our table made it quite clear he didn't want to be there. Several people on the table found his service and manners a bit of a downer on the night, otherwise great spot. The merchandise is good too!"
73,"Fanatics beers and a cool place. Try the nitro milk stout, the IPA and the Pridelweiss.Staff are great too! My worst fears about the Mr Yum order system came true: two identical orders from different people on the same table led to one being ignored as a duplicate. The staff were cool and understanding about it."
74,"LOVE this place. It will definitely become our new stomping ground!Update! SOOOOOOO great to come back here again!!! Scrumptious food, incredible service and amazing beers in a sensational beer hall! The perfect Melbourne venue. Can't wait to come back!"
75,"I made my maiden visit to the Stomping Ground motherlode with 5 thirsty mates last Saturday. This place is absolute legend! The beer is awesome (I'd drunk SG beers in cans many times before and there was a nice selection on tap even in crazy Covid times). The service was exceptional - we were really well looked after at our table by attentive staff offering samples, good humour and all round good vibes. The food was top tier, absolutely high end. We all had a blast even under the Covid-19 restrictions. The venue is trendy, airy and friendly. An easy recommend and I'll be back with more reinforcements guys  so keep those great beers coming!!"
76,Went out here for Father‚Äôs Day dinnerWent to order and all the pizzas were sold out and there was little to no other main meals to choose from so we ended up having to order 2-3 kids meals per person etc. Was a nice place just had no food on a busy day
77,"Been here for lunch and some drinks twice since covid restrictions were eased and restaurant dining was permitted. We were seated in the outdoor section both times as walk-in guests - we waited in line on the socially distant marks, and the sign-in process using the QR code was quick and efficient. The menu is slightly smaller than non-covid times, but all the items we ordered were delicious - in particular the hot sopressa and guanciale pizzas. Drinks were top notch as usual. Amazing experiences both times, I felt safe throughout the whole visit, kudos to staff for providing service with great hospitality. Planning to come back here many more times, especially in the hot lazy days of summer."
78,"The staff could have been friendlier - on multiple occasions there were two staff members who actively ignored us and another who was helping us with high chairs acted like we were an absolute inconvenience. However, Michelle was AMAZING! Her customer service made up for the other two, and constantly across the day she would go above and beyond for myself and my group. The atmosphere was amazing and the food was fabulous."
79,Checked out Stomping Ground for the first time last week after numerous recommendations and couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the experience. Beer garden out the back is massive with great vibes and the beers are delicious. I made a booking for 20ppl online which was so easy to do and there we no issues at all. Table with my name on it was ready when we arrived. Highly recommend checking it out.
80,"Beer great and lovely ambience. A good place for families to spend a few hours on the weekend.Wait staff are so grumpy though. Left a fair bit of our meal as it wasn't particularly nice (perhaps we ordered the wrong thing) and the waiter came up and said ""what's the deal with this?"" rather than ""can I take your plate"" or whatever. We watched another waitress see a toddler walking towards her but rather than step aside, she internationally walked in to him and had a face like a smacked...Perhaps they'd all been on the staff beer the night before!"
81,"We rented out the Courtyard space inside the venue on a Saturday night, it was awesome! Kay, Liz, Asha, and co took amazing care of us!  From the food to the beers to the entire staff, our group of friends that came (around 40) could not say enough good things.  If you want some of the absolutely best craft beer in Australia, you need to make the trek to Stomping Ground!"
82,"This brewery has an amazing and warm space with a fire and beautiful wooden decor. Pizza was delicious and other food was great too. Especially handy to have the play area for kids. Was pleased to see they had compostable straws (and a noted: if you don't need one, don't get one) and an environmentally friendly vision. Awesome place!"
83,"In a covid society, a surcharge of 1.5% just to use cashless pay. What a scam, not long ago stomping ground refused cash. Now penalising for not using cash. For an eftpos transaction the fee charged is less than 0.5% of the total. With the cost of living on such a steep rise with the average pay packet not changing, personally unsure if I can even afford that treat beer, especially when being covid safe and penalised for it. What a shame"
84,"as a brewery - good choice of beersas a venue - great decor and ambienceas a restaurant - horrible - stay away from steak (overcooked old piece of meat with a bit of greens not worth $36, not even pub grade), stuff forgot order (in an empty restaurant)"
85,"Popped in here on a Wednesday night for dinner. The atmosphere is cool with dim lighting and lots of timber. The place wasn't super busy, probably about a third full so we had our pick of tables. After placing our order at the bar we had to wait for nearly an hour for our food to arrive at which point we discovered they had taken our order down incorrectly and presented us with two side dishes instead of two mains. We didn't feel like waiting another hour for replacement meals so we just ate them and left. The food was also cold when it arrived and was extremely over priced for what it was. We will definitely not be back."
86,"Unfortunately not a great experience this time around, super short pours on all the beers and one meal came out 25 mins after the other, even though it was ordered first. The duck was preeeetty salty, even for someone like me who likes food well seasoned. Have definitely enjoyed this place in the past, perhaps tonight was an off night. Would love to see some female or diverse staff behind the bar in future too. Will surely be back, just a disappointing trip this time round üëç"
87,"Hosted my 60th Birthday Party in the deck area on Saturday October 5 2019.Excellent communication before the event and excellent service and welcome during the day.Really happy with the hospitality I was able to offer my guests, the team at Stomping Ground went out of the way to ensure we enjoyed the afternoon and that everyone had a good time.Kelvin"
88,"I was here for the beer only, so I can't comment on the food, but the beer was totally to my taste. I feel like I could go back in any of twenty different moods and there would always be something for my taste. Considering the bar was overstaffed, I could have been served quicker, but at least the bar was overstaffed so I didn't have to wait more than 30 seconds. Come to think of it, they were more interested in interacting with each other than with me, which I don't love."
89,Great hub for food and drinks. Very Melbourne with a beer hall style and rustic feel.Kids: Decent for kids too if they are conditioned to go out to pubs/cafes. A wooden play house in corner for the confident selfplay kids.Looking forward to another visit to try the menu properly.Beers: pints approx: $12.
90,"A range of interesting beers and, so far as we went, an enjoyable menu. Pizzas of a respectable size, good ingredients, well cooked, honestly priced. Not Napoli art pizza, but that's not what SGB are aiming for, and not what we wanted either, so no worries.Bar staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Floor staff . . . well, bless them, they suffer from the same hunter-and-collector directions that seem to haunt all Australian restaurants these days. Note to managers: if your crew aren't refilling those glasses and plates, and people are still eating or drinking, then leave things alone. Seems to be a Melbourne thing, or at least an Australian thing, so no points deducted, but still. [You'll hear more about this from me in future reviews].Great venue. A refurbished factory space with lots to look at for for people with an interest in architecture. Gets hot when it's north of 35 degrees, but they do their best with fans and sprays. Otherwise fine. Clean modern loos, too. Charming all 'round.On balance, it's a good time and decent value for money in this part of Melbourne.Pro-tip: this is a family-friendly place. If you have little kids and want to go out, or are cool with that vibe, it's great. If you detest little kids, or just want to drink quietly in peace with other grown-ups, you might consider more of a traditional pub."
91,"Nice place with great open atmosphere. The beer was good too.I ordered the sausage, which is essentially a single regular sausage on some chickpeas in sauce. This cost $20. While that aspect was the only small disappointment I can't help but be a little bit impressed by anyone who can sell a single sausage for $20."
92,We celebrated a 40th on a Saturday arvo & booked the deck space for 60 adults & 20+ kids. Was the perfect space as it was enclosed enough that parents didn't have to worry & with a table for activities plus the cubby house across the room the kids were occupied for hours. Staff were super helpful both in the lead up & on the day. From management ensuring the delicious food was sent out at the right time to bar staff serving up a huge range of beverages to security making sure everyone was happy & safe.It got busy as the day wore on but we were oblivious as we didn't feel at all crowded or like we had to move on.We were able to bring in some decorations & our own cake/desserts to make it a unique space for us.Highly recommend as a great daytime party venue or even just for a relaxed catch up with friends with kids or doggos!
93,"Located in a discreet area and surrounded by industrial buildings the brewery is a fit-out of large industrial warehouse, which has been renovated to provides a cool area to hangout  during the week and weekend.As mentioned by many other reviewers, great place for crafts beer and atmosphere. I was here during the weekend and it was pumping with energy, whilst the weekday offered a relax chill-out ambiance, perfect for the mid-week catch up if you're looking for a quiet night to cozy next to the fireplace.The crowd during the weekend was diverse and included friends/family catching up, parents sneaking  a 'cold-one' whilst their kids were playing in the playhouse, people predrinking before the footy game and couples.As a crafts beer brewery, the crafts beer selection was diverse and had something for everyone to enjoy from your lager to your more 'fun' beers such as a doughnut inspired beer (highly recommended) and guava beer. Definitely try the tasting paddle first since it'll give you the option to try their full range without making a large commitment to a beer you might not enjoy.Food wise, I found their side offerings such as chip and sweet potato crisps including calamari was really good and complimented the beer perfectly. However with the pizza I thought was okay and lacked a bit of punch and could use more seasoning.In terms of ambiance, the space offers a range of seating options including large tables suited for groups or smaller table suited for couples or friends. The space is filled with a lot of natural day light from the skylight and doesn't feel like a warehouse, which many similar spaces suffer. During the night, the space morphs into a cozy beer hall providing warmth from the fireplaces and privacy through the dimly lit lights."
94,"We found this delightful place about two months ago and have been returning regularly.The choice of beers is fantastic, catering for all tastes. Great food selection and the staff couldn't be more helpful.As a 'Pom', I do miss my UK Real Ale, however, with the choices on offer, it's the next best thing to a 'Warm British Pint'...Keep doing what you're doing."
95,"Great beers and atmosphere. Our food came out almost too quickly, and unfortunately it didn't impress. I had soggy boiled brussel sprouts with about 5 tiny bits of bacon with it, my partner had to return his burger as it was tiny and falling apart in his hands after 2 bites, and the Mac n Cheese that my mates had literally didn't have any cheese on it! It was a watery creamy sauce that they somehow thought could pass for cheese?! I'll go back for beers, but not for food."
96,A large well lit space with great beers and pizzas. We were with a group of about 40 and had pre-booked a small area. The security guards did a wonderful job of creating a prison-like ambience by regularly and unnecessarily telling us where we couldn‚Äôt stand on a relatively quiet night. Thank you for providing us with the rigid structure and boundaries of where we shouldn‚Äôt sit and stand. I didn‚Äôt realise it at the time but in hindsight we needed a drill Sargent managing this because we could not be trusted to congregate as we please.
97,"Beer: goodAtmosphere/decor etc: greatFood: below averageStaff: very grumpyBBQ sausage was nice, however, chickpeas were really hard and dressing tasted like a tonne of raw cumin powder - completely inedible.Halloumi dish was good, as expected. Can't really go wrong with that."
98,"Was really excited to come along, but unfortunately whole table was disappointed with meals, especially the really small amount on the ""share plates"" for the price.Excellent beer and amazing setting, but suggest you review the food so patrons don't leave feeling hungry."
99,"I had birthday drinks here last Friday. Booked a large table about 3 weeks before for the occasion. On the night most of my party had to line up in the freezing cold just to get in. I spoke with the manager and the security manager both who just told me 'bad luck'. Customer service was terrible, very obnoxious, security guards were on a real power trip. I would never book a table here again for a large group. Really put a dampner on my evening."
100,I am not sure if the cellar door ringwood or Stomping ground is better. Both amazingly and  the best brewery and beer. I keep coming back to the stomping ground purely based on the great beer and so much to offer. The staff are friendly and most welcoming. I learnt to take a bus ride to stomping ground on a Friday enjoy a Gibbs pint or in a jug before heading to the footy. The place has a great vibe and atmosphere and looking forward to catching up with friends their soon. Highly recommend..
101,"Very cosy brewpub with heaters & reasonably interesting craft beers. Clean comfy design of this restaurant too.The food is nice for eating with beer. But I just feel that the burger needs a revamp. The patty is boring and not really juicy, slightly tough. And I also think the condiments and sauces in it need to be redesigned too. Not just with aioli.. I want a burger to taste as if a chef has passionately thought about every ingredient going into it, I don‚Äôt want it to taste like they‚Äôve just put a burger on the menu for the sake of putting a burger on the menu and not cared to make it taste as best they can.They have some indoor plants and a fireplace in the middle of the dining room.The kitchen and the brewery are also visible from the dining room.I recommend the brown ale üëç"
102,Stomping Ground is an awesome place to hold an event/function! My daughter and I chose here for my son's 30th and what a great decision that was.First contact with Rachael was fantastic and she knew exactly what we would need/want..so thanks.(We would have had way too much food if I was left to do it lol)Venue is great ..atmosphere fabulous...staff awesome....food and drinks great!!!On the night Liz could not have done more for us to give us the best and easiest experience!! We had fun ..so thanks Stomping Ground we'll be back.
103,"Really bad experience with the person at the door, I‚Äôm 7 and half months pregnant and asked the guy at the door (came in by myself to meet my friends) to get in as I really need to use the restrooms and he said I needed to wait like everyone else and star yelling to everyone else that someone wanted to jump into the queue and made pejorative comments like pregnant women shouldn‚Äôt be going out and trying to get into busy places. It could be a nice place, but made me feel very uncomfortable."
104,"What an awesome space! The plants, the big fireplace, the open plan, it's all great. And, the variety in beers and pizza means you can keep coming back and try something different every time.We organised a Sunday afternoon event here in the courtyard and it was perfect. It is a popular and busy place but all the people at stomping ground went out of their way to make sure our party was looked after and had everything we needed. The events team were really helpful in the lead up to the event and made everything so seamless - from confirming the space, organising the food and providing advice on how to make it the best event.Just a great place to head down with a group of people. And, the perfect option for an event if you want everything organised so you can just enjoy your time with everyone!"
105,"Apart from their great brews, we experienced excellent customer service at Stomping Ground on a busy Sunday - when told that our food order would take longer than usual, we asked if we could cancel our order (which had already been put through to the kitchen). Our server (with North American accent) could not have been more helpful, organised a refund and even refunded the cost of my drink to apologise.These guys understand customer service and turned what could have been a negative experience into a really positive one. Will definitely be back and introduce my friends to this gem."
106,"Amazing service during tough times. When let down by a courier company,Stomping ground went above and beyond to make sure I received my Order. Thank you Justin and team for your amazing care. Keep brewing the good stuff.I look forward to when we can get to the brewery again soon (hopefully)."
107,"Visiting from Coffs Harbour, great location,solid selection of beers to cater for most and allow for some experimentation. In my case it was the sour ale, enjoyed it but wouldn't brew at home. The pizza was excellent and the staff went out of there way with my query re the IBU of the Hop Stomper. My wife enjoyed the Brown Ale and the venue- highly recommend a visit."
108,"Came here per recommendation of a friend with 5 friends. All of us went to the bar and ordered our food. Came back to the table and began to drink our beers that where very tastey. Then it took almost an hour to get all of our food. Mains came before entree‚Äôs, all the food was over salted, some food was so under cooked it was in eatable with the exception of the chips, although depending on the batch where over salted as well. After trying to get the attention of several servers who didn‚Äôt seem to care that our food was late & intermittent nore did they make mention of our half eaten food and why that might be, we left hungry and unsatisfied and spent almost 45$ a head. With so many great options around, we will not be back..  To bad because the place did seem to have a nice vibe but just couldn‚Äôt follow threw."
109,"This place is the dog‚Äôs breakfast of brewery venues.The venue is giant, and includes, among other things, a fireplace, a cubby house, a retractable roof, an open kitchen, an operating brewery, and plants growing all over the place.The beers are ok, nothing special, and there are about 20 to pick from.The menu features everything from pizzas to duck confit to steak tartare. Seriously, steak tartare.I was last there on a Friday night, DJ music so loud I had to yell at my mate, and I‚Äôm not thinking I saw any of the 35 uni kids having a steak tartare with all the beers they were skulling.Ultimately, everything about Stomping Ground screams out that it is trying to be everything for everyone, and ends up being mediocre instead."
110,"Lovely beer and food, plus the food hall is really spacious. Everything‚Äôs well spaced apart and it feels like they‚Äôre taking COVID seriously while maintaining a great environment.Beer‚Äôs well priced too."
111,We booked this venue for our daughter's 1st birthday and although we arranged it all at the very last minute it was a stress free process and the staff were very helpful on the day.The only negative was that they were so busy on the day that the food took longer than expected.
112,"Although a really lovely place I must advise that one of the security guards thinks of himself as a very special man... he also believes that he is somewhat of a medical professional... when asking me to wear my mask when going to the toilet, I advised him, just as I advised the front (with no issue) that I have a medical condition and cannot wear mine. His response was an eye  roll accompanied with 'oh here we go'. For this reason I give you one star, it would have been zero if I could,  purely for the rudness and disregard for people with mental health issues!"
113,"William Angliss Institute took a couple of groups of students to see the brewery and sample the beers.The students got a lot out of it and had a great experience. Thanks to Luke for taking us through the brewery and explaining the process of making various beers. You sure have a great brewery and some amazing beers.The Gipps street Pale Ale was the winner !Do let us know when you have some new beers as we would like to sample them for the education of our valued students.Thanks again for your time and the wonderful tourKamal- Teacher, Centre for Tourism and Hospitality ManagementWilliam Angliss Institute555 Latrobe StreetMelbourne 300096062111 Phone"
114,I'm giving this place one star based on the fact that the Sat night DJ's turned up the volume on their music that it was literally impossible to hear anybody speak.At a dance club - fine.At a pub - it would be nice to be able to actually be able to hold a conversation without losing your voice and having ringing ears by the end of the night.I would have liked this place and the event I attended but the DJ's just took over and destroyed the atmosphere.TURN IT DOWN WILL YOU !!!!!?????
115,"Began a lazy Sunday pub crawl here and all of a sudden, I've annihilated myself at the first place! I couldn't help myself - I had to keep trying the beers! The beers are amazing and its awesome to see how Stomping Ground really showcases different malts, hops and yeasts! Fantastic chill environment here, especially on a balmy Spring day."
116,Good morning ladies and unlucky gentlemen to be at this establishment built on deceit and  0 trust on society.This place is appalling. My sister in law and many others have been accused of taking drugs in the bathroom and a group of 25 of us were kicked out when we were all there for a 25th birthday for a recent graduate physio. We have all as a group never touched anything and are disgusted with the way we have been treated tonight. We calmly tried to talk to all staff members and the owner of the business and no one would hear a word of the facts as they had already made their decision unfortunately..Our group had spent hundreds of dollars and it's a shame to be treated this way when trying to celebrate a momentous occasion.Highly reccomend to never come here ever.Disgusting.
117,Tried drinking the watermelon smash ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù sour beer. It taste literally like Olive Oil.. I can‚Äôt believe how you could get something so wrong.The passion fruit smash is a LITTLE better but still get Olive oil.. Think you need to start again with charging me $5 a can at IGA it isn‚Äôt worth 50c
118,This would have been a 4-5 star review except for the rude arrogant judgemental woman that started behind the bar for the late shift who actually cost the venue a lot of money when our group of 30+ people walked out for her very poor judgement of the least intoxicated person in the whole venue. The other staff actually apologised for her actions.
119,"Very impressed, down from the country for the weekend, mate took me in for quick beer, ended up having 4 pints and a meal.Beer was tops as was the food fires and ombience bloody good.I'll  be back with friends.Keep  up the good work.Steve"
120,"While it seems to be a genuine craft beer brewing establishment, the lady at the bar managed to give me 2 wrong beers in the ‚Äòcore selection‚Äô six beers tasting pad - got two beers that were hoppy and very bright in colour in lieu of a brown ale and milk stout....Pizzas are good but pricey"
121,"Fantastic ales but   it's  a beer garden but not as we know it.In the UK a beer garden does what it says on the tin, you have beer in a garden.  Here it's more of a retractable roof.Notwithstanding that it serves a great purpose when it's cool.."
122,Such a great place for a group of 20.Food is seriously good.So many beers!
123,This place ROCKS !Plain and simple.Get your butt here and have a great time.
124,"Brought my friend and her parents here for their last dinner in Australia as I‚Äôd been here a couple times before for drinks.Not gonna lie, the service was pretty non existent - the best service we probably had was our own table member going directly to the kitchen to ask for some aioli and then grabbing us some cutlery on the way back cause no one else did‚Ä¶Food was mixed reviews amongst the table, the drinks were good."
125,"30-something, bald, male staff member scolded me like a naughty child over a minor misunderstanding, in front of my entire group. He was unbelievably rude and condescending, and kept going at me even after I had turned away from him to try and avoid being berated further. That sort of attitude has no place in a hospitality venue at any point in the day/ night, but especially not during a relaxed family lunch. He ruined the day for me and we all left soon after."
126,"(Translated by Google) That was pretty much nothing. We wanted to see the local brewery culture and were received rather coldly. There was enough space and the service was fast. I wish there had been a little more explanation about the beer. So it seemed rather careless. That's a great pity, because the beer was great and the place was lovingly furnished! Maybe we just had a bad day. It can happen.(Original)Des war eher nichts. Wollten uns die lokale Brauerei Kultur anschauen und wurden eher k√ºhl empfangen. Es gab genug Platz und der Service war schnell. Ich haette mir gew√ºnscht, da√ü es etwas mehr Erkl√§rung zum Bier gegeben haette. So wirkte es eher lieblos. Das ist super schade, das Bier war n√§mlich klasse und der Ort liebevoll eingerichtet! Vielleicht haben wir nur einen schlechten Tag erwischt. Kann ja mal passieren."
