The chefs take on each cuisine, turning well known dishes from each South East Asian country and putting a spin to it was very captivating.The standout was the prawn toast, the Burmese goat nhat however was a bit too spicy for our liking.The menu was welly adapting to my friends dietary requirements, brownie points for that! Service was great, great interior decor, it did get a bit loud inside, overall we had a good experience."
1,This is a delightful restaurant with great food and first class service.   What impressed me most was the friendly and helpful staff.   The menu is restricted but has some gems.   Everything was delicious and the chef considerately put the extra spice on the side - that served the different tastes of my wife and I.   There‚Äôs also a good wine list.
2,"It's beyond my expectation. Service is good - we said 'choose mi' and friendly staff patiently explained in details, picked fantastic dishes for us and surprised all of us.Everything we had is delicious. The sweetness, spicy and so much on not overwhelming the food itself but giving each dish the depth of taste. Zucchini flowers is one of the best I've tried so far in all restaurants.Hainaness Chicken is so tender and the curry has so much flavours in it.I just love everything served that night!Cocktails are also the top quality. You can also ask for your favourite if it's not on the menu. They just deliver it!I forgot to ask how often they change their menu but I will definitely go back again and again even for the same dishes."
3,"Food was ok but nothing special.Kudos to staff trying very hard to accommodate special vegetarian requirements.Salmon in curry didn't work.Pork belly was very crispy highly recommended. However some vegetables were badly burnt to a point they tasted bitter.Crab omelette egg was dried and overcooked.Zucchini flower batter was tough and cold, feels like it has been refried.Roti was very nice.Very slow in dishes delivery and if you can't remember all the orders please put them down on a docket somewhere.Overall the whole dining experience was a mixture of hit and misses... but certainly we won't be missing this place."
4,"I caught up with an ex colleague and decided to try the food here.Food [4] fusion but tasted great.Service [4] staff is friendly and patience as we love chilli and had asked for different type of chilli which we were served.Ambient [3] kind of warm indoor, perhaps the staff are in their casual so won't feel it."
5,"Fried Chicken Ribs In Nuoc Mam - Crispy, sauce was well balanced with both sweet and sour.Plantain And Banana - crispy plantain fritters but the star was the banana dip.Chilli Crab & Prawn Dumpling, Sea Vegetables & Salmon Roe - the sauce was amazing. Literally cleaned the plateWild Kingfish Kinilaw, Citruses, And Sorrel - The only dish that disappointed us that night. The fish wasn‚Äôt fresh. They insisted it was the flavour of the fish cured in coconut. Tried to tell me this is how ceviche taste like. ü§£ I‚Äôve ate too many ceviche to know what is fresh and what is not. Had to ask them to take an untouched portion of the fish back to the chef to taste it. Honestly if it wasn‚Äôt because of this I‚Äôd give a 5 star.Wild Mushrooms and Satay - was alright.Roasted Bone Marrow, Marinated Rump, XO Prawn - packed with flavour. And that crispy roti just completes it.Borneo Boar Sausage And Fermented Chili - delicious sausage. Boar meat gives it a more chew than using just pork meat.Hainan Chicken Breast Curry Pickled Mushroom - silky smooth hainanese chicken with this amazing curry sauce. Such an brilliant combo.Crispy Pork Belly, Rica Rica Sauce, Green Apple & Radish - crispy crackling but we thought this dish was alright, done well but nothing amazingTimorese Barramundi Ikan Pepes With Quince And Ai Manas - well cooked fish with a very flavourful sauce.Seasonal Wok Fried Vegetables In Fragrant Paste - $15 for a few strands of vegetables. Could‚Äôve provided a bigger portion to charge $15.Jungle Tubers with Glazed Pumpkin Seed & Marigold - $15 for root vegetablesBiodynamic Aromatic RiceRotiLeche Flan - silky smooth but on the sweeter sideBuko Pandan - love the textures going on in this dessert. Flavour was great as well.Definitely one of the better Asian fusion I‚Äôve had in Melbourne CBD in terms of flavour. Lack of consistency, ordered fried chicken ribs twice, the second was soggy not fried well."
6,"‚òÜ Breakfast at Miss Mi was included in our stay at the M√∂venpick Hotel Melbourne.‚òÜ Staff were always friendly, welcoming and accomodating throughout the breakfast service.‚òÜ The space was large and open, with plenty of natural light coming through.‚òÜ Fruit and pastry baskets were fresh and the perfect way to start our meal. Juices and coffees were also delicious.‚òÜ Throughout our stay, we tried the 'Omelette', 'Miss Mi Benedict' and 'Miss Mi Granola'. All the dishes were delicious, fresh and had generous portions. They kept us full for the whole day!‚òÜ Also loved the water jugs shaped as fish. They brightened up my morning!"
7,"We were welcomed on arrival and accommodated at the bar while our friends arrived and table still being prepared. The restaurant was full and staff at the bar under pressure however accommodating for my alterations to ‚Äòno booze for Mi‚Äô drink.Once seated we were pretty much left alone. We needed to ask for the menus drink then food. Our waitress was helpful with recommendations while choosing our dishes (a few drinks and food item not available). Food was delicious and portion sizes ok. 4 adults and we shared 4 street snacks/raw, 2 from the grill, 3 sides.My advantage plus membership discount it was ok value for money.Dietary restrictions: Multiple Gluten and dairy free options in each course"
8,"I decided to come here on my birthday with my family on a Wednesday night for dinner and came back Saturday afternoon for just a drink. First of all, the menu is very unique and the ingredients and flavours from each cuisine is impeccable üëåüèΩ We ordered, the Timorese Barramundi which was so flavourful with a slight hint of chilli. The Burmese Goat was also amazing and soft with a great sauce. I was surprised by the spicy sauce of the Boar Sausage. The nuts were a decent appetiser along with the chicken ribs. Overall, a great experience, the only downside would be that the food took quiet a while to arrive and when we arrived on Saturday for the bar, we stood around for 5 minutes and had to get the menu ourselves."
9,"The place is so nice and open. Very attentive service. Very fast response with the communications. I could contact them through Facebook messenger and the response was pretty quickThe food were pretty good .. and a bit small portionsIf you like a sweet coffee, you have to order the cafe Saigon coffee cocktail"
10,"The food was very fantastic! If you like asian fusion food, I recommend you to come to Miss Mi and have a meal. Not only the taste of foods but service also was perfect. Sari was very nice to us.This was my 2nd time trying kangaroo. For my first time, the smell of it was too strong, but it's very nice here. We also ordered chicken curry, the texture of it was very soft.I definitely will come back again :)"
11,"Had a couple of astoundingly good meals here while visiting Perth from interstate. The lamb ribs which fell off the bone, kangaroo satay, the duck, the Filipino style ceviche and the whole fish.Special mention goes to the wait staff, in particular Alicia who made our table feel incredibly welcome and warm. She brought a delightful spirit and had absolutely spot on recommendations. Some really special experiences and I can't wait to return when I'm back in Perth."
12,"Went there for dinner on Wednesday, got a table easily without reservation. Staff were professional and friendly.I ordered the wild kingfish kinilaw with citruses and sorrel, which I would describe as a fresh Asian-flavoured ceviche, it was enough for me but if you were hungry you would need to grab a couple other dishes to fill up.Lovely atmosphere and cool decor, only thing that was a bit confusing is people (including me) kept trying to come in the wrong door, they probably need to put a sign up. Besides that, would recommend!"
13,"P1 omelette taste good, combination is creative and I love this one, but maybe a little more sauce may be better for this one! 7.8/10P2 the lamb rib, the best of the night, you can imagine how it taste, but still it taste good!8.9/10P3 seafood dumpling, it‚Äôs okÔºåtaste is good, but crab shell in the dumpling really lower my appetite, 7.2/10P4 kingfish, I would say the sauce is creative and good, the kingfish is ok, but combination together is like dressing up in a style that totally not fit you. 6.6/10P5  grilled prawn, we just had grilled prawn in Sydney atelier, compare with that grilled prawn this one is just a disaster, it smells good, taste ok, but the meat of the prawn is too dry! Control your cooking time with grilling should be cooking lecture 1, but this prawn, I think every one can guess how dry it is from the size of it because you just grilled out the juicy soul inside it! 5/10P6 the worst of the worst that night! Crispy pork belly should be crispy but not hard like hard candy, I can‚Äôt believe that this restaurant just serve it! The skin on it is just too thick, and it is too hard, hard enough to make you think your teeth will fall! This is absolutely not acceptable at all! And also the sauce is salty like hell! 0/10P7 hainan style grilled chicken, can anyone see the how black it is from the picture? I can definitely tell you this one taste so bitter, and I hope the chef know that you are here to serve food not burnt charcoal! 0/10P8 roti, little above average. 7/10P9 pandan & lychee pudding too seeet, but ok, 6/10, 5.5/10Food: 5.4/10Service: kindly and friendly staff, passionate when serving but, when I tell her I had bad experience about the main food, I didn‚Äôt get any respond from the chef!All these food 270dollars, with Accor plus member I paid 135 dollars, if I really paid 270, I would be really mad at the quality of these food!Not recommended at all!"
14,LOVED IT ALL!My partner and I celebrated our 4th anniversary at Miss Mi last night. The customer service was excellent and they accommodated for our request to sit next to each other (we got a much bigger and cosier table).Pandan cocktails are my favourite so I was really excited to see it on their menu. It was so delicious ‚Äî I love the aftertaste of pandan. My partner also wanted a pandan drink but wanted to try something different so the bar gave him something really yummy off the menu ‚Äî it was a pandan sour.As far as the food - the starters were SO good. I was really happy to see a Lao dish a part of the experience as it brought a piece of home with me to Melbourne. The flavours were bold yet gentle to the palate all at once which is so quintessential to southeast asian culture.We loved everything on the set menu especially the swordfish and wagu. The dessert was spectacular. All the flavours and textures went so beautifully together.We can‚Äôt wait to come back and try next season‚Äôs menu. Thank you to the chef and staff for making our anniversary dinner so lovely :)-Jenn and Sam

Roti was fabulously light, crispy, and also very oily.Have dropped down from a 4/5 to a 3/5 because the dishes weren't as creative, although it's still a nice place to catch up with friends.-------02/22Miss Mi takes asian fusion to new level by bringing dishes from all across Asia.ORDERED: JOURNEY THROUGH ASIA, summer menu, ($95.00pp)ü•ú Tasty Peanuts   Green mango and Jeow Bongü•í Smashed cucumber & apples with Szechuan pepper oil   Street snacks from across Asiaüçö Naniura of Sumatra, fermented jackfruit, grapes, bumbu batak & crispy sprats in seaweedü•ü Banh xeo of pork & octopus, mung beans, pickles, nuoc mam with summer plantsü•£ Burmese goat nhat, stone fruits & tomatoes, cabbage, kohlrabi & papaya thoke in tamarind & shrimp dressing.

I love set menus, because it really pushes you out of your comfort zone and forces you to try something new. It gives you the opportunity to discover your new favourite dish/flavour!Instead of specialising in one cuisine as other restaurants typically do, Miss Mi takes advantage of Melbourne's openness to cuisine and shapes it into an experience.Armed with surprise and curiosity, I was blown away.No dish is too salty, sweet - just a perfect balance that I know will keep me coming back and recommending Miss Mi to friends.My earth-shattering experience was from the Naniura of Sumatra. The flavours were so fresh and clean. It's filling, without weighing down the palate while looking incredibly unassuming.Only reason which Miss Mi isn't a perfect 5/5 is because they took almost 3 hours to serve a 6 course. Incredibly slow compared to my other experiences.So, go, but ready yourself for a journey."
16,"Parents came in from Sydney and we decided to eat here for dinner on Thursday 8th Dec.Every single dish exceeded expectations and each was like a special event in itself.The service was also fantastic. Staff were very charming and attentive, and it was very refreshing to feel so welcome.My parents wouldn't typically eat at a place like this and it was really special to see how much they enjoyed it all.Will definitely be back with some more people next time. Hands down the best restaurant on this side of the city"
17,"Words cannot express how amazing our experience was. I will rate this place more than 5üåüFoodMany places offer fusion food but no one (that I‚Äôve tried) done it so well. Miss Mi celebrates (and respects) all the wonderful flavours from Asia with a take of Melbourne - combining l all the fresh ingredients, cooking techniques & gorgeous presentation. We went on a journey to China, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Malaysia‚Ä¶ to name a few.ServiceOne word - ImpeccableVibeNice vibe and decor. Love that we can see the kitchen & chef, whilst not fully open planLet me know how your experience go and see you again Miss Mi"
18,"The place had a wonderful and vibrant atmosphere with a cozy and warm ambience. Although the food took some time to come out, it had excellent presentation and each dish looked delectable. The service was great and the staff were accommodating.Kid-friendliness: Not suited for childrenWheelchair accessibility: It is goodDietary restrictions: They asked beforehand if we had any dietary restrictions"

20,"Went for our wedding anniversary, unfortunately we were sat at the chefs table but couldn‚Äôt see the chefs over the plates and weren‚Äôt able to look at my husband without moving our chairs as it was a bench, not very romantic. The restaurant manager was lovely and she wished us a happy anniversary and the service was fantastic and the food was delicious! We are Accor members and have now added this to the top of our list to return! Our favorites were oysters, lamb ribs and dumplings for entrees and pork belly with wok fried greens."
21,Dinner was incredible. Every single dish we ordered was absolutely delicious. We even ordered extra roti bread to savour some of the sauces. Service were friendly and professional. An excellent restaurant to watch the world go by.Wheelchair accessibility: Fully wheelchair accessibleDietary restrictions: Loads of options.

23,"New restaurant located in front of southcross sation,  86.96 tram stopMy first impression of restaurant was thatI thought its dumplings or Chinese restaurant because of first pictureBut they served more likely South East Asian dining experience  ‚Äútaste wise and presentation wise‚ÄùList of alcohol wasn‚Äôt not outstanding but reasonable and food was unexpectedly good üëçI can tell that head chef have a lot of experience and wide knowledge of foodSo my overall experience wasFood : 9/10Service 9/10Drink 7/10Price 8/10But there is a little bit misreading because of dumpling neon sign    ( look like dumpling restaurant)But i love  I would come back again"
24,"A beautiful restaurant, but food were hit and miss. We loved the zucchini flowers, grilled baby barramundi, roti and all of the desserts in the menu. The ones we didn‚Äôt like were lamb ribs and pork belly. Lamb ribs were dry and too sweet, and pork belly was so salty. We also ordered chilli crab dumplings, hiramasa kingfish, blue fin tuna, and wagyu satay. They were good, but not our favourite. For the price they‚Äôre charging, I expect amazing food, but it was just okay overall."
25,"Went there for Valentines dinner. Amazing experience overall. Food was wellPresented and the flavors out of this world, could tell the chefs have put their heart and soul in it. What stood out was the service of the front of house, being a busy night they did a great job and our table was well looked after, they were all very friendly. Special mention to the manager who looked after us quite well. And last but the best were their cocktails, had the bloody sour gin and their Mis Mi Martini. Will definitely be visiting soon."
26,"Dined here on Thursday night as part of Melbourne Food and Wine Festival. The food was nice and it's good to see Filipino food becoming more popular in Melbourne. Unfortunately the service was terrible. They forgot to give us 3 dishes and gave us 2 of the same dish (we had to tell them we already received that course). The lady in charge (wearing purple dress) was absolutely rude and made us feel bad when we asked for the dish that they forgot to give us. Her response was: ""Oh do you still want it? But you know you have dessert coming."" I felt so bad so I said ""OK we will take it away."" What kind of restaurant that charges $114 per person would do this??The serving sizes were inconsistent amongst the tables- some had more , some had less.The waiters also didn't introduce the food that came to our table. They rushed us out and gave us 10 mins to eat our dessert before slamming the bill on our table without so much asking how the meal went. They wanted us to leave by 745 pm so they can set up for their next seating but dessert didn't come til 755 pm.Went to another MFWF the day before at Pastuso and that was a much better experience than this."
27,"I recently visited here during the MFWF, and while the food was quite enjoyable, I can't help but express my disappointment with the service we received. It was, without a doubt, some of the most disorganised and frustrating service I've ever encountered.My partner and I were baffled by the seemingly irregular pace at which our dishes were served. We frequently found ourselves glancing around, feeling overlooked as other guests received their courses while we were left waiting.Our experience was further marred by the following incidents. At one point, our waiter informed us that they were ""skipping ahead several dishes,"" which left us reminding the staff multiple times that we hadn't yet received the previous courses. It was quite disheartening.We also had to request the lechon dish after noticing that almost everyone else had been served, making us feel forgotten yet again.To top it off, after our main course, we realised that the staff had neglected to serve us one of the dishes. When we inquired about this, the response was so unwelcoming that we felt like we were inconveniencing the staff by simply asking for what we were entitled to.The finale of this unfortunate experience was being left to wait for our dessert, only to be rushed through it once it finally arrived with the bill for our drinks being unceremoniously dropped on our table before we had even finished, giving us the impression that we were being rushed out.Overall, it was a truly disheartening experience that left me feeling disappointed and unwelcome. I wouldn't recommend dining here."
28,"The food was delicious, thats where the positive comments end, the experience was not worth the expense. Inexperienced/uninformed staff, one course not delivered (until we mentioned it), then rushed to clear our table before we could finish the missed course so dessert could be served. Pre paid food (a part of MF and wine), want to pay equal parts for our beverages and refused to do so even though the server had the eftpos machine in hand.Had taken part in another restaurant two nights earlier and the experience was completely different."
29,"We chose the chef selected banquet and everything on the menu was deep-fried, the food was extremely fatty! Would not consider this a good restaurant in anyway, cheap shortcut cooking techniques. Even the salad was terrible and all of this for $200 for 2 guests? WOW!!! We also got up this morning with heartburn and stomachache. So if you value your health, I recommend you stay away. The worst dining experience ever. I‚Äôm sorry to my wife who was celebrating her birthday on the day. ‚òπÔ∏èWheelchair accessibility: I think it might of had access for disabled people"
30,"Not good. The wagyu beef satay is their most expensive main and came out with the beef cold. Second attempt, it's hot but now obvious it's not a satay dish. There is no peanut sauce other than a literal half teaspoon at the side. It was certainly not ""already cooked in peanut"" as the excuse came.  Frying a steak in peanut oil in any case is not satay.The kids fish and chips was fine.The restaurant staff were somewhat apologetic but perfunctory. The bar server clearly hated their job and wanted to deliver a drink without any greeting, hospitality, warmth or politeness.The menu prices are not the same as the menu posted on the website.Also be warned they do not let you box or otherwise take leftover food. Thankfully we were staying in the hotel so able to argue that they can bring room service trays, so why not kids meal leftovers. For other guests, this seems like a bizarre middle finger to food wastage! If they have a tenuous concern towards food safety/reheating in that respect, they should prioritise not serving cold food out of their kitchen first."
31,MFWF 2023. Compared to another Filipino (Serai with Diana Chan) Mi was disappointing. The venue was 'high class' for CBD but food was less than average. In fact the rice W soy sauce was the star. The presentation of the roasted whole pig was also eye catching but the meat was dry and seasonless. I gave it 3* overall  for the effort but individual metrics (food service etc) can improve. They also deserve a downgrade for not allowing doggiebag and contributing to the climate crisis. Google it: About 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we stop wasting food.
32,"Food was delicious, reasonably overpriced though and the service was nothing impressive. 2 Prawns for $32 was very surprising. However definitely worthy of 4 stars for the taste of the food alone.Vegetarian options: Poor vegetarian options"
33,"Food was good. Staff were welcoming.  The only disappointing was they didn‚Äôt give us the table which I requested in the booking and also double checked with them a day before at first place. After their manager went through the reservation note and booking details, and my wife and I standing at the entrance for another 10 min, they finally let us sit there. but no one came to apology for this inconvenience."
34,"Kudos to the chef there. I would recommend chicken ribs, lamb ribs and fried veggies there. Also I was surprised by the hidden menu - kangaroo skewers there. Very impressive.HOWEVER, be aware of the service. As an Asian fusion restaurant with above-average prices, I would expect nice drinks and food as well as a great chat with my friends. Unfortunately, our conversations were interrupted by the staff more than five times. I don't mind changing the plate/chasing me to order when I am talking but would appreciate if the staff could ask me first. I am not sure if it happens to every customer they serve but at least I did not see that happen to the table next to us.Please respect your customers and make the service value for money."
35,"Dined in as a group of 4. Central location and the tables themselves were spacious.The food is fusion asian and was not bad. The portions were a little odd and is more to western tastes.We had a wine each and the list was okay too.Service was super quick. Great if you're in a rush, but we were there for a dinner before heading out and it felt like we were watched like a hawk. Probably better if there was 1 or 2 people allocated to sections, and giving a bit of space for us to consider the menus, and enjoy the food and drinks."
36,"Miss Mi was a pleasure to dine at. The food was amazing, every plate was thought out to please the eyes and taste spuds.The food looked like it had just been harvested or caught, cooked and then served. The Chili Crab & Prawn Dumplings is reason enough to go back and back. The Barramundi was amazing, flaky, sweet and you wanted more. The Chicken Curry with some of their Roti was addictive. The menu is not a big one and it seems they have chosen to do a few dishes only and focus on them being standout dishes. The staff were attentive and very friendly. Looking forward to going back and trying what i didn't have."
37,"My first time in this restaurant. I ordered three dishes and one dessert. Two of dishes were great but crispy pork belly is extremely salty. Extremely. Then I told one of the staff that it is way too salty and she asked me if she could bring the dish to the chef or something. I did say that if nothing can be done, I will finish it as I dont want to waste food. And the dish never returned.I was quite puzzled about the staff communication and I think there was a misunderstanding here.Very bad experience."
38,At my table now writing this. As regulars at Miss My we have discovered their signature Martini. Using their own special gin they gave us a perfect drink to start the evening. We are polishing of the culinary delights with plans to take a bottle of gin home. Big thanks to the staff and especially to John who suggested the martini.Peter
39,"I was oh so disappointed. The pork and barramundi meals were fine and the wine list was really good however non of this matters when the service is just non existent, thought we had the invisible table. The ma√Ætre d / manager/ supervisor was just not interested. We could not get anyones attention to clear our table and when someone finally came she cleared what she could carry ( not much) and never returned. We couldn‚Äôt attract anyones attention to pay the bill. It wasn‚Äôt as if the restaurant was full in fact far from it. To top it off our waitress told us ‚Äúyou have had a lot of wine, you drank a whole bottle‚Äù my friend and I shared a bottle, we were too shocked to respond."
40,Second time dining here.  The menu is changed periodically which is great to try new offerings.  Lovely ambience.Wheelchair accessibility: Wheelchair access is only available if the side entrance doors are open.
41,"We dined here for dinner on a Tuesday night. There was three of us and we ordered 2 snacks, 1 small, 2 large, 2 sides and 3 desserts and 4 non-alcoholic beverages - it came to about $80 each.The food was hit and miss - the Chicken Ribs and Pork Crackle were great starters, the Kingfish Kinilaw was ok, the lamb ribs were way too fatty and didn't have enough sauce, but the Barramundi was fanatastic. Sides were rice and the salad and both were quite good.Dessert was the biggest let down - we all ordered the flan and found it to be too hard/set and the texture wasn't smooth.Ambiance - felt like you were in a hotel, it was too open and bright for a dinner setting. Good for groups I guess, but not for a romantic dinner.Service - No complaints here except that they were short staffed, which we were advised about at the start."
42,"Had a great experience dining here with a group of 6 adults and 6 toddlers. Staff were great from the moment we booked till getting kids and prams out during peak dinner time. The place was spacious and nice, food was delicious and we all were able experience a nice meal with toddlers, thank you Miss Mi!Prawn toast üëå"
43,"The food was tasty but very small portion sizes. Don't think you can split a main and entree between two people. We had the pork belly and the tomatoes, and were starving afterwards. For $70, you really shouldn't feel starving after finishing.The service was really terrible. Even being lead to our table to start with took an eternity."
44,The barramundi was devine. The chicken curry was also amazing. This is one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had - delicious.Kid-friendliness: The kids menu was great too.
45,"Staff taking order did not know their own menu, in fact advised us wrongly. Avoid the calamasi cocktail, that was vile. Food sounded like all the right Asian flavours, but missed every single note. Very disappointing. Perhaps to be expected, as few very Asians dining in, iykyk. Atmosphere wise, very nice! Last but not least, no icecreamon the menu at all? Saddd as"
46,"Evening ruined by BAD SERVICES!!!Food is good which is why I give it more than a star. However, the night was completely ruined by the shabby services, especially by the female caucasian manager.The manager was so bossy and made the two waitresses approached us so many times, cutting into our conversation and rushing us to order food & drinks, when we were only given 5 mins to read.When the manager was removing the side plate before serving the main course, she put my chopsticks on the table, where there was a chopstick stand right in front of her. It is a restaurant serving Asian fusion foods and charging $70-80 pp on average. As a manager, you should at least know Asian culture and that is why the chopsticks stand designed for. Plus the hygiene considerations, how could you put someone‚Äôs chopsticks on a table to no table cloth?Last part which is also the worst. When the manager knew that we were not ordering any dessert, she started to tell us that we have to leave by 8:30, which is in 10mins away. How could you come up with a random rule without informing us in advance? There were no crowd waiting nor next booking, for what reason you want to kick up out from the place?I feel so shamed about the services in this place and feel sorry for the chef and the rest of the team."
47,"Went there for an anniversary dinner last week.  We ordered a bottle of wine within 10 minutes of getting and ordered entree after.  The entree arrived but the wine hadnt.  When we enquired, firstly we were told that someone was trying to open the bottle and it was a bit tricky, then we were told that they didnt have the bottle of wine anymore.  We ordered another bottle and were told after 10 minutes that this bottle wasnt available either.  We were luckier the third time.  It took 40 minutes to get that bottle of wine by which time our entree was almost finished.  The food arrived in good time and was quite nice.  We missed out on dessert since the kitchen had closed by the time we finished dinner, however,  we asked for a glass of sweet wine instead and were told that we'll have to move to the bar (about 5 metres from the restaurant) to get that because the kitchen had closed!"
48,Edit as I forgot that I only left a star rating:One of the best meals I've had this year. Reminiscent of the meal I had at Momofuku Seiobo except a journey through Asia instead of the Caribbean. Many dishes felt familiar but refined and elevated both in presentation and taste (prawn toast was a great example of this!).I did see that Chef Khoo was leaving his post at the restaurant soon. Looking forward to wherever he goes next.
49,Just ordered the red rice nasi goreng while in the Movenpick Hotel and what a joke that was. Had zero flavour and for $27 I would of been better off crossing the road and eating from the gutter. Burnt egg and chicken with barely any meat on it. I've been to Indonesia a handful of times and this was unlike anything I've ever tasted while eating at authentic indo restaurants
50,"If you can't travel to SEA, do yourself a favour and book at table at Miss Mi. It's truly a journey of epic proportions and yet so Australian at the same time. What I love is that they don't hold back on the spice. It's enough to ignite a party in your mouth but never enough to render it numb. Plus, the staff are amazing and truly exudes the warmth and friendliness that is so homegrown."
51,Service was terrible. We had booked for 8.15 got seated at 9.15. Had cocktails while we were waiting which weren't great either. Once we were finally seated we were advised that there is no set menu. The wait staff didn't really know what was going on. The manager seemed annoyed at the fact we were even there. We ordered just about everything on the menu and it wasn't enough so we asked to order more to only be told that the kitchen had been closed. Won't be visiting again.
52,"Miss Mi has only recently  opened  and is located opposite Southern Cross Station.  The restaurant is surrounded by glass so it looks put to Bourke and Spencer Streets.Asian dining with a twist.Tiger prawn toast and Wagyu beef were my favourite dishes.The dessert was delicious, glutinous rice and pandan cream on the outside and inside a biscuit base and icecream.  Haven't  seen this anywhere.Great meal and service.  Staff were very friendly.  The dishes were tasty and well presented.One negative was that there was too much ice in the cocktails.Excellent dining experience and will return to try the other dishes and drinks.Instagram: @wazzzzzzza"
53,"BUYER BEWAREWhile the food was nice - if you are going to dine here, please check your bill!!!My partner blindly paid for our dining experience and it was only on the way home did I realise we were overcharged by $23What would have been a really fun night out was tarnished by this lack of care. I hope noone else has to feel this sting."
54,Service was slightly on the slow side and food was only average to what was expected.Dietary restrictions: Staff member went above and beyond to accommodate my allergy
55,"Mediocre food and service, underwhelming restaurant masquerading as a sophisticated fusion cuisine.Main portion sizes were tiny and zero value for money."
56,Really enjoy dining here and thanks to the sommelier and staff.  Hainan curry with a Piedmont Barbera D√Åsti what a combinationVegetarian options: Plenty there on the menu
57,"$33 for 2 medium sized prawns was excessive. Minced salmon at $28 with curry flavour was entree size, at best.But flavours of food were excellent. Roti was yummy.Vegetarian options: Enough non meat optionsParking: CBD so no parkingWheelchair accessibility: Flat ground floor, hard surfaces with ramp so good accessibility."

59,"If you're looking for a unique Asian dining experience, Miss Mi in Melbourne should definitely be on your list. From the beautiful food with tasty sauces to the pleasant environment and prompt service, everything about this restaurant was sensational.Starting with the starters, the dishes provided a journey of flavors that kept getting better with each course, from the mains to the desserts. The restaurant's tagline, ""A place where Asia's diverse flavours and traditional techniques are reinterpreted for modern-day adventurers,"" is spot on. As an Asian foodie, you won't be disappointed with the selection on the menu.One standout dish that I absolutely loved was the king prawns. The sauce was incredibly flavorful and complemented the prawns perfectly. I also had the leche flan and buko pandan dessert, which was simply divine. As a Filipino, I had high expectations for these dishes, and Miss Mi did not disappoint. The people in the kitchen were Filipino's ( narinig ko lang sila nag uusap in Tagalog haha ) and they did a phenomenal job of giving justice to these desserts.Although the portions were small, they were bursting with flavor, making it absolutely worth it. Overall, if you're looking for a restaurant with amazing food, great ambiance, and exceptional service, Miss Mi in Melbourne is a must-visit.nakakatuwa lang how my fellow filo's can create amazing dishes! ‚ù§Ô∏è i thought madidisappoint ako nung simula from the starters but it gets better and better, so i would recommend to get a course meal.what we ordered from the ala carte menu :Chili Crab & Prawn Dumplings Sea Vegetables, Yarra Valley Caviar $26Spiced fried Lamb Ribs Chili Caramel GF, DF $23Premium Oysters Quandong Shallot Vinegar GF, DF $36Wagyu MB9+ Beef Satay Soy Egg, Sweet Potato, Radish, Leek, Lobster GF, DF $59Skull Island XO King Prawn Cauliflower, Black Garlic, Pumpkin Seeds DF $33Yellow Fin Tuna Tom Yum, Shiso GF, DF $29Buko Pandan GF, V $21Leche Flan GF, V $18and a bottle or Pinot Grisif you can't decide , they can choose the set meal for you ‚ù§Ô∏è just say ""choose mi"" for $75/$95 pp"

Service was a little slow consistent with the high customer demand.Food was excellent.  Fresh, tasty and good serves.Drinks were reasonably priced.  Miss Mi draught is quite a nice beer."
